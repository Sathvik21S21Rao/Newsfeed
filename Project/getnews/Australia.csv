"NRL 2021 LIVE updates: Sydney Roosters v Melbourne Storm - The Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.1 of 3Well, that’s that sorted then.Hello, what do we have here? Christian Welch comes through on Sam Walker after a kick - it’s all legal - but James Tedesco takes exception and has a few words with his Origin rival. He wasn’t happy about the treatment on his little No.7.And they come from everywhere! It’s nothing more than a little push and shove, but a few players get dragged to the ground. I still reckon there’s a blow-up in Felise Kaufusi and Angus Crichton before the end of this game.Anyway, there’s no action taken by referee Adam Gee and we’re going back to a knock-on from Josh Addo-Carr from the Walker kick. Just the natives getting a little restless. Addo-Carr is human after all.That man again.Josh Addo-Carr, the top try-scorer this year and bound for the Bulldogs next year, is on the end of a screaming left side play involving Nicho Hynes and Justin Olam, who lays it on a platter for his winger to grab his third of the night. He did get six in a game earlier this year and two in Origin II four days ago.I reckon that last pass might have been forward, but not even the match officials can keep up with the Storm at the moment. Scintillating.Hynes has a kick in teaming rain from the sideline .... and he sprays it out to the right. Storm lead 34-0 nine minutes into the second half.Want some good news, Roosters fans? Jared Waerea-Hargreaves has taken an intercept on his own line and ran almost 40 metres. The bad news, Roosters fans? On the same play he had it stolen by Cameron Munster.In the next set Nicho Hynes has a try chalked off for obstruction with Jusin Olam ruled to have impeded Sitili Tupouniua. Right call.I still think this will get to 50 later tonight.Underway in the second half. This could be the longest 40 minutes of Trent Robinson’s coaching career.Nicho Hynes gets us away.So where is it all going wrong for the Roosters? We know how bad their injury toll is - they’ve already lost three senior players to retirement this year - but I thought they’d be up for the fight tonight. This might be the game where we officially put the red line through them trying to win the title.Stats time: Melbourne has dominated possession with 55 per cent of the ball while completing at a steady 78 per cent. The Roosters have been horrible at 63 per cent and it’s no surprise to see they’ve barely made half of the running metres of the Storm (1219 to 692).Fullback Nicho Hynes has 123 running metres for the Storm, helped by that 70-metre try off a kick return. Reimis Smith has 91 metres and Dale Finucane has been enormous in the pack with a try and 88 metres. Kenny Bromwich and Brandon Smith have 18 tackles each.The Roosters? Daniel Tupou has 109 metres and James Tedesco 91. Sam Verrills has made 28 tackles.What can the Roosters salvage out of this game now? Trent Robinson is still in his seat during his half-time address, but that’s about as animated as you see him. Not hard to understand why.The gulf between the Storm and the Panthers to the rest has never looked bigger.Jared Waerea-Hargreaves is tackled by the Storm defence.Credit:GettyWhat is happening tonight?Well, after four straight posts highlighting Storm tries I finally get to publish one that is not another four-pointer. That’s only because it’s half-time and the Storm lead 30-0. Yes, you read that right.“I cannot believe this scoreline,” Phil Gould says. “I would never have believed that. Gee they’re a good side, but the Roosters have been very disappointing.”And they were probably the better side for the first 15 minutes.Josh Addo-Carr has two tries and Cameron Munster has shaken off his State of Origin blues. How ugly will this get in the second half?It’s been a fast start by Josh Addo-Carr and the Storm.Credit:GettySo, about that 66-16 the Storm racked up against the Tigers last time out. Any chance of it being beaten tonight?James Tedesco is trying to engineer something for his side, throwing a flick pass under pressure near half-way and Justin Olam dives on it for the Storm, almost simultaneously popping it up for Josh Addo-Carr.Guess what? You ain’t going to catch the Fox from there and that’s his second for the night.Nicho Hynes adds the two from near the sideline. This is getting very ugly for the Roosters as the Storm lead 30-0 with two minutes before half-time.What is happening?I thought the Roosters were on top in the opening 15 minutes, but this game is all but beyond reach for them at the moment as Kenny Bromwich steams onto a short ball from Cameron Munster close to the Roosters’ line after they marched up the field on the first set after their last try.“Those last two tries, honestly if you just looked at those you would think this is going to be 60,” Phil Gould warns. “I’m absolutely stunned by the lack of resistance here from the Roosters.”Nicho Hynes doesn’t make a meal of this conversion and the Storm now lead 24-0 eight minutes before half-time.Are you Tigers fans feeling a bit better about yourselves now?From two bizarre tries, to one of the softest you will see all weekend.Cameron Munster just shovels the ball to a hard-running Dale Finucane, who is seemingly held up by Lachlan Lam and Angus Crichton about eight metres out from the line but he just keeps driving the legs. And there comes the extender arm to plant the ball down!How did he score that?“That’s a soft try,” Phil Gould laments in commentary.Nicho Hynes misses the conversion attempt, but the Storm still lead 18-0 after 30 minutes. Huge warnings signs for the Roosters now.1 of 3",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.363%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_520%2C$y_83/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/cc118a1ff64692273bf9d3d8e65a0a2e02569ffc,"AFL live ScoreCentre: Gold Coast Suns vs Tigers live scores stats and results - ABC News

Australian boxing sensation Tim Tszyu says he's bearing ""a lot of anger"" following bitter rival .But rather than drawing a line through a bout with Zerafa in the future, out of disgust, he remains open to beating down on the Melbourne product, declaring: ""I still want to get my hands on him.""Zerafa pulled out of the blockbuster July 7 fight due to concerns over the health and financial wellbeing of his team.It was a decision  and led to a last-minute line-up change, with unheralded youngster Steve Spark (12-1-0, 11 knockouts) stepping up for the main event.Health authorities assured Zerafa's camp that it was safe to travel to Newcastle and that they would only need to quarantine upon re-entering Victoria until they returned a negative COVID-19 test result, which they'd receive about 24 hours later.But Zerafa's team flagged concerns that stricter COVID-19 restrictions could be implemented during their time in Newcastle, which could lead to a 14-day quarantine period being imposed on them.The fight's promoter, No Limit Boxing, headed up by 2011 Manly NRL premiership front-rower George Rose, even allowed Zerafa to weigh in for the fight in Melbourne and fly in and out of Newcastle in a private jet on the day.But he still abandoned the fight, leaving Tszyu seething.""There's a bit of anger in there, a lot of anger actually. I've been preparing well, preparing hard for this fight and I really wanted to take this guy out,"" Tszyu said.""It's been a long build-up, a couple of years in the making, so there's been a lot of anticipation for this particular moment, and I was only one week out from getting my hands on him.""I still want to get my hands on him just for the fact that he's made me angry. I'm not happy, I'm quite frustrated, so I do want to get my hands on him, but we'll have to sit down with the team later on and consider what we do. But I do want to get my hands on him.""When Zerafa was trapped in Melbourne's lockdown in early June, Tszyu was preparing for the super-welterweight clash on the Gold Coast.Tszyu said at the time that ""the weather here is beautiful"" and it ""feels like it's summer"", while hitting Zerafa with a ruthless barb.""He'd be struggling out there ... in lockdown,"" Tszyu said with a wry grin.""I couldn't care less about what he's feeling.""And Tszyu, the son of legendary Australian boxer Kostya Tszyu, now accepts none of Zerafa's reasons for deserting the fight, despite the challenges of COVID-19.""There are a lot of sacrifices in boxing,"" Tszyu said.""Unfortunately for that team and for him, they didn't see the point in it.""We put our lives on the line. Even if you need to do a two-week quarantine, do what you've got to do. This is supposed to be the fight of your life, a fight for Australia, every fan wanted to see this. And they didn't just want to see the fight; they wanted to see him get floored.""Tszyu commended No Limit Boxing on its efforts to save the fight.""The boys did everything they possibly can,"" Tszyu said.""There's no COVID here in Newcastle so I don't see what they're complaining about.""And again, even if you have to quarantine later on when you get back home ... this is our lives, this what we do for a living. We don't wake up and go to work 9-5. We do this, we train, we fight, we dedicate, there's a lot of sacrifice involved and that shouldn't even be questioned.""Search properties in AUSTop Utes!",https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/m8gVRogNItHNEAXp7xnBU1H3mMw=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F09%2F01%2F10%2F23%2Fnational.jpg
"As it happened: ASX takes a breather, dips 0.7% as blue-chips sag - The Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.1 of 4That’s all from Markets Live today. Thanks for tuning in! Alex Druce will be back in the morning to round out the week. Crown Resorts faces a fresh money laundering scandal stemming from its illegal practice of accepting credit card payments in exchange for gambling chips through the hotel desk at its Melbourne property.The casino giant’s chief financial crimes officer, Steven Blackburn, told Victoria’s royal commission into the company he expected a review underway into the credit card transactions would find indications of money laundering, and that the total value of payments could total more than the $160 million already identified.Steven Blackburn, group chief compliance and financial crimes officer at Crown Resorts, said suspected money laundering would be found in the credit card transactions. Crown’s licence for its new  found it enabled money laundering in its bank accounts, and the credit card payments are a new headache for the James Packer-backed group as Victoria’s royal commission reviews its Melbourne casino licence.Crown disclosed in June that it had breached Victorian law between 2012 and 2016 by allowing international visitors to make credit card charges of up to $500,000 to their hotel accounts in exchange for casino chips.Read the full story hereOpinionRegulators haven’t yet started to roll out a vaccine for Australia’s other pandemic - the highly infectious fear of missing out on property ownership - which has resulted in annual price growth more rapid than anything seen in almost two decades.The most infectious variant is house ownership - where prices in Sydney have risen by 15 per cent over the past year and Melbourne prices have increased 9.7 per cent this calendar year, according to the latest data from CoreLogic, pushing the median values to $1.22 million and almost $930,000 respectively.Unstoppable: Australia’s house prices keep rising. Credit:Peter RaeAn even more frightening statistic - Sydney’s average house price has risen 20 per cent since the start of the year. The waves of lockdowns across the country have barely caused a blip in the property market’s strength.While homeowners are wealthier, at least on paper, the exuberance is locking out a growing number of aspiring property owners out of the market. Another downside of allowing the demand-driven spread to go unchecked is an increase in riskier lending by banks and the plethora of non-bank lenders that have entered the market over the past five or more years.The fear is that the risky behaviour could lead to greater financial system instability.The ASX 200 started the new financial year on the back foot, with many of the market’s biggest names hitting reverse.The local benchmark shrugged off a positive lead from Wall Street, dropping 0.7 per cent to close at a session low of 7265.6.Investors started the session in the afterglow of a record fiscal year, with the ASX finishing the 12 months to June with a staggering 24 per cent gain.The ASX 200 dropped 0.7 per cent on Thursday.

The patented technology is key to Masimo’s core business and Apple is unfairly copying the features, the company claims.Masimo says he public won’t be harmed if the Apple smartwatch is kept from the US market as it’s not an essential health device.Masimo, which develops signal-processing technology for health-care monitors, and its spinoff, Cercacor Laboratories, first sued Apple in January 2020, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and improperly using Masimo inventions related to health monitoring in its Apple Watch.The patents in the federal case are being reviewed by the US Patent and Trademark Office after Apple argued they didn’t cover new inventions. The judge put that aspect of the case on hold until the reviews are completed.Unlike a district court, the trade agency won’t delay consideration of the patent complaint and it typically completes investigations in 15 to 18 months. Conversely, if Apple decides to challenge these patents as well, the patent office is likely to decline any request for a review because the ITC works so quickly.The dispute is likely to end in a settlement that could net Masimo between $US50 million ($67 million) and $US300 million a year in royalties, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tamlin Bason said in a note on Tuesday.

While most other major markets apart from China have cleared the MAX to fly again, SpiceJet seems in no hurry to get it back in the air, and not just because there’s less demand to use the jet because of the pandemic.SpiceJet hasn’t flown any of its Boeing 737 MAX jets for more than 27 months.Credit:BloombergIndia’s second-biggest budget carrier booked other income of 10.9 billion rupees ($190 million) in the seven quarters through December.That was the amount it expected to get in compensation from Boeing for not being able to fly its 13 MAX aircraft, helping the company to trim its losses during deeply challenging times. Given the planes remain grounded, the figure is likely to rise when SpiceJet reports results for the year through March this week.SpiceJet is the only Indian airline that operates the MAX. With firm orders for 142 more, it’s also one of its biggest customers globally. Yet the carrier hasn’t asked regulators to lift the flying ban in India, a person familiar with the matter said. There’s no clarity on why it has held back, and it would take at least a month after applying to get approvals in place, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter is confidential.SpiceJet declined to comment.

Electronic conveyancing platform PEXA had a wobbly debut on the ASX on Thursday after the biggest float of the year, struggling to shine in a sluggish market and closing the day at a bare premium to its issue price.Ringing the bell: PEXA Group CEO Glenn King, chief customer officer Lisa Dowie and CFO Richard Moore. PEXA suffered an outage the night before its IPO.   One investor pointed to the “ironic” timing of a ministerial roundtable discussing competition in the e-conveyancing industry, which PEXA dominates in Australia.Just as PEXA hit the boards on Thursday, NSW Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello emerged from the roundtable with the Australian Registrars’ National Electronic Conveyancing Council.PEXA’s electronic conveyancing platform handles more than 80 per cent of all property transactions in Australia, and the roundtable discussed whether interoperability – where two or more systems exchange and use information – was required in order to broaden competition in the$280 million industry.Glenn King, chief executive of PEXA Group, defended the company’s stronghold as the largest player in the electronic conveyancing market, saying the group is helping develop a workable national model of competition based around interoperability.“PEXA welcomes a competitive market for digital property settlements in Australia,” Mr King said.On the eve of Thursday’s ASX debut, PEXA suffered a technical outage.While the outage was quickly rectified, banks, conveyancers, land title offices and other parties were prevented from settling transactions for nearly two hours, highlighting the risk a single provider poses for the conveyancing industry.ACCC commissioner Anna Brakey said that if necessary legislative reform is not progressed now, Australian customers risk losing the possible benefits.“A failure to implement interoperability as soon as possible will see the incumbent provider become further entrenched and delay a genuinely competitive marketplace,” she said.Start-up Sympli has been trying to break into the conveyancing industry and pointed to outages like Wednesday’s as illustrating the need for competition.“It was the biggest settlement day of the financial year and too many customers were frozen because the system was not resilient,” Phillip Joyce, chief executive of Sympli, said.“When you’ve got a monopoly, you get no genuine choice, not innovation, no pressure on prices, we need to get the incumbent to the table.”In March, an agreement was made to  and have a working system in place by year’s end.The agreement was backed by Commonwealth and state ministers, PEXA and rival Sympli, the Australian Banking Association, Australian Institute of Conveyancers and Law Council.As it stands, more than 400,000 properties change hands each year in Australia.PEXA emerged from a 2011 Council of Australian Governments agreement between the states and territories, which pledged to digitalise their paper-based property settlements system.Despite the regulatory cloud, one of the cheeriest investors after Thursday’s float was Link Group, which maintains a 42.8 per cent holding in PEXA.Link’s CEO, Vivek Bhatia, had been the public face of the IPO, and the trade show that knocked back a $3.1 billion buyout offer.“Link Group is very pleased with the outcome of the PEXA IPO process,” Mr Bhatia said.“Link Group will retain its significant holding in PEXA, supporting and benefiting from its future growth, while the net cash proceeds Link will receive from the process will improve the strength and flexibility of Link’s balance sheet.”Link, which values its stake at about $1.4 billion, also confirmed this week it will receive  from the IPO. Commonwealth Bank holds 23.9 per cent of PEXA.While the prospect of enhanced competition and an erosion of PEXA’s profitable network effect may worry some investors, those who bought up shares during Thursday’s float seemed happy enough with the company’s global growth ambitions.PEXA aims to crack the $720 million British conveyancing market, where it hopes to replicate its Australian success by upgrading the paper-based conveyancing system with its technology platform.On Thursday morning, the company said property market volumes remained strong at the end of FY21, with transaction volumes through the exchange lifting over 4 per cent more than June’s prospectus had forecast.Over the year, PEXA’s transactions were 48 per cent higher than the same period a year earlier, at 960,000 transactions.The IPO has a deferred settlement day of July 5.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$width_140%2C$height_140/t_crop_fill%2Cq_auto:best%2Cfl_any_format/7d21c7b87da1a58827d1ff6ed1f7c20a171064e6
"Mass vaccination rollout boost - NSW Liberal Party
The Berejiklian Government will establish two new mass vaccination centres, plus a large clinic in the heart of the city in preparation for a larger supply of Pfizer vaccines, boosting the NSW contribution to the Federal Government’s vaccine rollout.
 
The new sites add to the NSW Health 100 vaccination clinics and outreach locations across the state.
 
The NSW Health vaccination sites complement the GP Network, which has and will continue to deliver the majority of COVID-19 vaccines across NSW.
 
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the NSW Government is ready and willing to support getting vaccine doses out as quickly and as safely as possible.
 
“In NSW we have a sense of urgency about getting jabs in arms, because once the vast majority of our population is vaccinated, we can start a conversation about reaching a ‘covid-normal’ state,” Ms Berejiklian said.
 
One of the new mass vaccination centres will be established in South West Sydney at an old Coles building in Macquarie Fields, the other will be in the Illawarra in a former David Jones building on Crown Street in Wollongong – together they will deliver tens of thousands of additional jabs each week.
 
They are in addition to the state’s nation-leading hub at Sydney Olympic Park, plus a second mass vaccination centre in the Hunter Region, due to open within weeks.
 
In addition, a Sydney City vaccination hub site has been secured close to light and heavy rail lines that will serve city workers and residents through extended opening hours.

Many people like to snuggle up to their pet, but new research suggests cats may catch the coronavirus while sleeping on their owner's bed.In April 2021, scientists from the University of Glasgow reported A study by the University of Guelph, Ontario, now suggests nearly seven in 10 (67%) cats and more than two in five (43%) dogs develop antibodies – infection-fighting proteins that indicate a past infection – after a member of their household tested positive for the coronavirus.Cats that sleep on their owners' bed are particularly at risk, the results – presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases conference – suggest.Read more: The same is not true for dogs, who tend to nod off further away from their owners' face, reducing their risk of infection, according to the Guelph scientists.Cats may also have more so-called ACE2 receptors, which the coronavirus use to enter cells.""If someone has COVID-19 [the disease caused by the coronavirus] there is a surprisingly high chance they will pass it on to their pet,"" said study author Professor Dorothee Bienzle.  ""Cats, especially those that sleep on their owner's bed, seem to be particularly vulnerable.  ""If you have COVID-19, I'd advise you keep your distance from your pet and keep it out of your bedroom.Read more: ""I'd also recommend you keep your pet away from other people and pets. ""While the evidence pets can pass the virus on to other pets is limited, it can't be excluded. Similarly, although pets have not been shown to pass the virus back to people, the possibility can't be completely ruled out.""Since the coronavirus outbreak emerged at the end of 2019, experts have been looking at whether animals can catch the infection or develop severe complications.In March 2020,  ""weak positive"" for the coronavirus.  even developing its tell-tale dry cough.The coronavirus is primarily a human infection, which mainly spreads face to face when a patient expels infected droplets in a cough or sneeze.Read more: The risk of a human transmitting the virus to an animal was thought to be low, but the Guelph scientists have argued it was actually ""incompletely defined"".To learn more, the team analysed the blood of 48 cats and 54 dogs from 77 households owned by someone who had endured the coronavirus within the past nine months.These blood samples were compared against those of 150 cats or dogs from a shelter or ""low cost"" veterinary clinic.More than seven in 10 of the cats and 43% of the dogs that were privately owned tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, compared to just 9% of the animals sampled in the shelter and 3% from the veterinary clinic.Of the owned dogs, one in five (20%) developed symptoms. These were mainly fatigue and a loss of appetite, however, some also endured a cough or diarrhoea. All of the symptoms were mild and resolved quickly.More than a quarter (27%) of the owned cats showed signs of the coronavirus, typically a runny nose and laboured breathing. Most of the cases were mild, however, three were severe.The fact that more of the owned animals caught the coronavirus than those from the shelter or veterinary clinic reinforces the belief that pets generally catch the infection from a human, rather than the other way round.""Fortunately, to date no pet-to-human transmission has been reported,"" said Dr Els Broens, from Utrecht University in the Netherlands.Nevertheless, ""pets could act as a reservoir of the virus and reintroduce it into the human population"", added Dr Broens.Watch: Do coronavirus vaccines affect fertility?When it comes to animals catching the coronavirus, experts have previously warned against ""mass hysteria"".When news of the ""weak positive"" Hong Kong dog broke, Professor Jonathan Ball from the University of Nottingham stressed ""we have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of the virus"".""The fact the test result was weakly positive would suggest this is environmental contamination or simply the presence of coronavirus shed from human contact that has ended up in the dog’s samples,"" he said.The World Health Organization (WHO) has stressed, however, anyone with confirmed or suspected coronavirus should ""limit contact with companion and other animals"".""When handling and caring for animals, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented,"" the WHO states.""This includes hand washing after handling animals, their food or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, licking or sharing food.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/spQx2VnKp5g1Y47Ligx3sw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-02/77d4ab00-46c1-11ea-8ff7-15b37948471e,"No new cases primes WA to exit lockdown - Newcastle Herald

Martin Krause receives funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and is a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft, the European Astronomical Society, the International Astronomical Union and the German Physical Society.View all partnersFor the first time, a faint signal caused by the merging of two almost equally mysterious objects – a black hole and a neutron star – has been recorded on Earth.On January 5 2020, when the world was first learning of the COVID-19 outbreak, gravitational waves from this merging reached the Livingston detector of the ) gravitational wave observatory in Louisiana, US. On January 15, the second gravitational wave event from a merger between a black hole and a neutron star, the densest stars in the universe, was discovered.These two recordings are the first mergers between a black hole and a neutron star  to have been detected on Earth. Black hole-neutron star binary systems, where a black hole and a neutron star orbit each other, had been predicted but never observed – until now.Gravitational waves are distortions in space-time, predicted by Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In a , the distance between two suspended mirrors is measured with a laser. The measurement technique relies on the overlap of reflected laser light within the experiment. Two light waves are arranged so that the signals cancel each other out exactly. Changing the distance between the mirrors by even a tiny fraction of a wavelength produces a measurable light signal.The basic idea behind the theory of relativity is that space itself possesses a kind of elastic structure, even in the absence of any matter. Similar to an inflated balloon, you can squeeze it one way and it expands in the perpendicular direction. Relativity predicts that matter warps space (and time) and a collision between two compact objects like a black hole and a neutron star rapidly changes the compression and relaxation of the space in the vicinity of the objects. Waves of periodic compression and expansion are emitted. The way to measure these waves is to monitor the distance between two otherwise fixed objects, because the gravitational wave will periodically change the extent of the space between these objects, as it passes.During the first ever detected gravitational wave event in 2015, for which three physicists were awarded the Nobel prize in 2017, the distances between the mirrors in the two stations of the LIGO observatory, which are 4km (2.5 miles) apart, changed by about a thousandth of a trillionth of a millimetre. The merger detected in 2015 was between two comparatively massive black holes, each around 30 times the mass of the Sun. Since then, the sensitivity of the instrument has been improved. Now also a smaller, less sensitive, gravitational wave observatory in Italy, called the Virgo experiment, is frequently used as part of the telescope network. In the new discoveries, the merging objects each had less than ten times the mass of the Sun. The event on January 5 involved objects with respective masses of 8.9 and 1.9 times the mass of the Sun, and the merger on January 15 was between objects with 5.7 and a 1.5 times the mass of the Sun.It’s important that the smaller masses were below 2.2 times the mass of the Sun, because this suggests these objects were neutron stars. Neutron stars are so dense that an amount of matter comparable to the solar system is compressed to a diameter of about 20km.The matter in a neutron star is so dense that atoms get crushed, resulting in the formation of neutrons. The strong gravity on their surface makes them, in their own right, interesting laboratories to study effects of general relativity. When a neutron star becomes even more massive, for example when some interstellar gas falls on it, the nuclear forces can no longer resist gravity and the star collapses to a black hole, an object so compact that not even light can resist its gravitational pull.

Neutron stars and black holes are not that rare in the Milky Way. They are a common outcome from the evolution of stars significantly more massive than the Sun. Such massive stars often occur in binary systems, with two stars orbiting each other.It’s not surprising to find neutron stars and black holes in binary systems, where they are locked in a gravitational dance. Such binaries emit gravitational waves for their entire lifetime.The energy for the gravitational waves comes from the motion of the objects around each other. As the system emits gravitational waves, the objects get closer together. This makes the gravitational wave emission increase and, finally, the two merge into a new, bigger black hole, with a burst of gravitational wave emission. This is what is detectable on Earth.While it was expected that neutron star-black hole systems existed, we’d never been able to spot them before. Neutron stars emit radio and X-ray emissions, which can now be routinely detected. Other than looking for gravitational waves, black holes can only be observed when something falls on them – a star or interstellar gas, for example.If a black hole has a normal star companion, it can capture mass from the companion which emits X-rays before it disappears into the black hole. Binary black holes have no obvious source of gas, and they’re known only from gravitational wave experiments. A neutron star-black hole system could in principle be discovered with radio telescopes, but – so far – the search has not been successful. This new discovery provides important information about the astrophysics of such systems. More discoveries will surely be made, which will help to improve our understanding of what is inside neutron stars and black holes – and quite possibly also provide new tests, or proofs, of the theory of relativity.

A 3D model of Triamyxa coprolithica's anterior view.""We didn't know how insects looked in the Triassic period and now we have the chance,"" said Martin Fikáček, an entomologist at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan and co-author of the paper published Wednesday in the journal Current Biology. As more coprolites are analyzed, scientists may find some harbor nicely preserved insects, Fikáček added. Amber, which is fossilized tree resin, has encapsulated insects dating back as far as 140 million years. This batch of dung lets scientists see even further into the past. Fikáček and the research team glimpsed inside the fossil poop using a method called synchrotron microtomography, which works like a hospital CT scanner but with strong X-ray beams. The technique makes it possible to visualize 3D internal structures in fossils with great resolution and contrast.The researchers found the beetles with their legs and antenna intact. The scientists say the coprolites' chemical composition, along with the early mineralization by bacteria, likely helped preserve the creatures.""I was really amazed to see how well preserved the beetles were,"" said paper co-author Martin Qvarnström, a paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. ""When you modeled them up on the screen, it was like they were looking right at you.""The scientists named the species Triamyxa coprolithica, referring to its Triassic age, beetle suborder and its discovery in coprolite. Modern representatives of Triamyxa's beetle suborder, Myxophaga, are small and live on algae in wet environments. In its day, Triamyxa likely lived in semiaquatic or humid environments. The beetles were likely ingested and expelled by Silesaurus opolensis, a beaked dinosaur ancestor that measured roughly 6.5 feet (2 meters) long and lived at the same time as the beetle in what is now Poland. An artistic reconstruction of Silesaurus opolensis, whose dung housed an intact ancient beetle. Silesaurids, which includes Silesaurus opolensis, are one of the closest relatives to Dinosauria. As they lack shared derived features expected in the most recent common ancestor of Iguanodon, Diplodocus, and Megalosaurus and its descendants, Silesaurids do not seem to be true dinosaurs, according to the University of Maryland. The Silesaurus in question appears to have munched on multiple Triamyxa individuals, but scientists say the beetle was probably too small to be the dinosaur ancestor's only target. ""Triamyxa likely shared its habitat with larger beetles, which are represented by disarticulated remains in the coprolites, and other prey, which never ended up in the coprolites in a recognizable shape,"" Qvarnström said. ""So it seems likely that Silesaurus was omnivorous, and that a part of its diet was comprised of insects.""Whether it was the small beetle that Silesaurus found particularly delectable, or something else, it's a good thing it left us with a remnant of its lunch, a rare portal into insect fauna millions of years ago. ",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/CTUkUkNRnZJL-kgQi34FN_1VeZU=/84x84/2021/06/15/8a67f50d-eae8-4cf2-b842-32fe8263f75f/meara-isenberg-headshot.png,"What The Heaviest, Smallest White Dwarf Ever Found Means For Science - Forbes
Someday, even our own Sun will eventually run out of hydrogen fuel in its core, bringing a tremendous set of changes to our Solar System. Its core will contract and heat up while its outer layers expand and slowly get expelled, signifying our transition into a red giant. When the helium in the core is exhausted, the core will contract further, becoming a carbon/oxygen white dwarf, while the remainder of our star gets blown back into interstellar space in a spectacular planetary nebula. For practically every star born with 40% to 800% of our Sun’s mass, the same fate awaits them all.The white dwarf that we’re left with is always much less massive than the star it originated from, and never more massive than about 1.4 solar masses. Above this mass limit — known as the Chandrasekhar mass — a spontaneous thermonuclear reaction will occur: a type Ia supernova, destroying the white dwarf entirely. Driven by a series of curious observations, a team of scientists just discovered the most massive white dwarf ever robustly measured: between 1.327 and 1.365 solar masses, and it’s only 2,140 kilometers in radius, or barely larger than the Moon. It’s a fascinating find, but what it teaches us is truly phenomenal.While we might look at our Solar System and our Sun as a “typical” example of what’s out there, it’s important to recognize that we’re only a sample size of 1, and that nature comes in all sorts of varieties. 95% of the stars in our galaxy are less massive than our Sun, but that remaining 5% means that approximately 20 billion stars in the Milky Way are more massive than we are. Additionally, about half of all the stars we know of are part of a system with two or more stars in them; singlet systems like our own are extremely common, but binaries, trinaries, and other multi-star configurations are quite common as well.The reason this matters is that many binary systems are born with stars of similar masses, and hence they have similar fates. If one star in a binary system becomes a white dwarf, the other one likely won’t be far behind. The brightest star in our night sky, Sirius, has a white dwarf and a star more massive than the Sun orbiting one another; come back in about a billion years, and you’re almost certain to find two white dwarfs orbiting one another instead.But that’s the beginning of the story, not the end. Just as binary black holes and neutron stars are known to inspiral and merge, so, too, will white dwarfs in binary systems. When they do, if their combined mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, you’ll get a stellar cataclysm: a type Ia supernova, which can briefly shine as bright as some ~10 billion Suns.But if their combined mass remains below that critical threshold instead — and keep in mind that some white dwarfs can be incredibly low in mass, with the lowest-mass one coming in at just ~17% the mass of the Sun — they’ll simply lead to the formation of another white dwarf. This new white dwarf should have some particular properties that set it apart from white dwarfs that form from single stars, so even if we only find a white dwarf post-merger, we should still be able to identify its origin. In particular, we expect:All of that, however, is purely theoretical. Theoretical studies can be incredibly useful, particularly when those theories are informed by robust observations that paint a consistent picture. But it’s when we find new objects that push the limits of what’s possible that the biggest scientific advances — the ones that take us beyond what’s already been established — can often occur. Astronomically, one of the newest frontiers occurs in what we call time-domain astronomy: signals from the Universe that vary, in some fashion, on very short timescales.One of the best tools we have to study these short-time changes is known as ZTF: the Zwicky Transient Facility. By monitoring a portion of the sky with excellent precision over a period of time, you can become sensitive to small, periodic changes in an object’s brightness. (This is something you automatically lose if you take a time-average of your data, and one of the greatest science losses  threaten to inflict on the field of astronomy.)When looking at the ZTF data, astronomer Kevin Barnes noticed something unusual. One object in the sky — a faint, relatively nearby point of light — appeared to fainten and brighten periodically by about ~3% every 7 minutes: an incredibly short timescale for such a large variation. Even though ZTF scans the sky on much longer timescales, about every 48 hours, Barnes was able to pull this rapid, short-period signal out of the cumulative data.Whenever you see something that’s unlike the other things you’ve seen before, even if you’re only first seeing it because of a technological advance, your instinct ought to be to try and understand precisely what’s happening. The way we do that, astronomically, is to attempt to determine as many properties of this object as possible, and the way we achieve that is by taking as many information-rich, complementary observations as possible.The first hint of this object’s nature came by adding in the data from the ESA’s Gaia satellite. From its perch up above Earth’s atmosphere, Gaia can accurately measure the properties of stars, including their position and brightness, over long periods of time, like months and years. As the stars move through the galaxy and the Earth orbits the Sun, this enables us to infer the three-dimensional positions and proper motions of hundreds of millions, and perhaps even billions, of stars within our own galaxy.When we traced this light source back to its identification in the Gaia data, we found that it was only ~130 light-years (about 40 parsecs) away. From its brightness, color, and distance, we can infer that it must be a white dwarf. And with such a large, periodic variation on merely ~7 minute timescales, that tells us something else: this white dwarf must be rotating incredibly quickly.White dwarfs, you see, are typically about the size of rocky planets, even though their masses are comparable to that of a star. If you imagined, for example, cranking up the mass of the Earth until it was about 300,000 times as dense and massive as it is today, raised its temperature to somewhere around 10,000 K, but maintained its current size, you’d have something like a white dwarf. Only, for this particular white dwarf, it rotates a full 360° about its axis not in 24 hours, but every 7 minutes: 200 times as fast as the Earth. If you were to measure the speed of this white dwarf at its equator, you’d find it’s traveling at about 95 kilometers-per-second, or 340,000 kilometers-per-hour.Why is a white dwarf so dense, and why does it spin so fast?One reason is that you have so much mass together in one place, but no nuclear fusion to produce radiation. Without that extreme power output to “push back” against the force of gravity, the matter inside has no other option but to contract until something can counteract the pull of gravity. The only candidate left is the integrity of matter itself, and quantum rules like the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which prevent two identical subatomic (fermionic) particles from occupying the same quantum state. That’s where the Chandrasekhar mass limit comes from; go above a certain threshold, and even this quantum rule won’t be sufficient to stop you from collapsing. Once your total mass rises above that critical value, you’ll either trigger a set of runaway fusion reactions, or — if you’re already something like a neutron star — you’ll collapse completely: into a black hole.One of the interesting things that happen to white dwarfs as they gain mass and approach this limit is that their physical size actually shrinks the more and more matter you add. The space between individual particles decreases, due to the gravitational force, by a greater amount than the cumulative addition of extra particles adds to the overall volume. As a result, the more massive your white dwarf gets — the closer in mass it gets to the Chandrasekhar limit — the smaller and smaller it gets. A white dwarf that’s less than half as massive as the Sun might be up to twice as big as the Earth, but white dwarfs that approach this mass limit can be smaller than even Mars.When you see a heavy white dwarf, one close to this mass limit, there are a couple of ways it could have formed. You could either make one from a massive star that was just slightly below the mass limit needed for a supernova, or you could make it from the merger of two smaller, lower mass white dwarfs whose combined mass still didn’t quite reach that limit. Spins this fast — completing a full rotation in ~7 minutes — aren’t expected to arise from isolated, singlet stars that evolve into white dwarfs. It should have come from a merger, as its rotation period is comparable to that of : 5 minutes, 17 seconds.But, if it did arise that way, there’s another clue that we should be able to go out and look for: it should also have a strong magnetic field. Neither ZTF nor Gaia could provide that information, but follow up observations with other sophisticated instruments could.That was where Ilaria Caiazzo, Caltech astronomer and lead author of this new study, came in. She spearheaded a slew of follow-up observations, including:Combined with the ZTF (short-period brightening/faintening) and Gaia (parallax) data, the scientific team working on this project was able to extract an enormous amount of information about this object. What the observations indicated was that this white dwarf does possess a strong magnetic field: 800,000,000 Gauss (about one billion times stronger than Earth’s magnetic field), with variations of around ~25% over the surface of the white dwarf. The temperature of the white dwarf is very hot: 46,000 K, making it one of the hottest white dwarfs on record (possibly also indicating its youth), and also extremely small, with a radius of just 2,140 km.This makes it the smallest white dwarf known, beating the prior record holders which came in around ~2,500 km. If we were to compare this white dwarf to objects in our Solar System, it would be smaller than even Mercury, and in between the sizes of Jupiter’s moons Callisto and Io: the 3rd and 4th largest moons in the Solar System. (Earth’s moon is 5th, if you’re curious.)This new white dwarf — officially known as ZTFJ1901+1458 — has the smallest radius, the heaviest mass, and one of the shortest periods ever measured for this class of objects. Its large magnetic field points to an origin based in the merger of prior white dwarfs.That does not, however, mean that white dwarfs like this are rare. Nor does it mean that white dwarfs don’t get heavier than this; estimates of the Chandrasekhar mass vary slightly based on rotation and composition: between 1.38 and 1.45 solar masses. This white dwarf, whose mass is estimated to be between 1.327 and 1.365 solar masses, is certainly on the high end of the spectrum, but there ought to be white dwarfs that are really pushing this limit. In fact, one of them — a white dwarf orbiting a red giant in the T Coronae Borealis system — could . The white dwarf there is estimated to have a higher mass: 1.37 solar masses, but its uncertainties are also greater, as we cannot presently obtain a good radius measurement for it.In fact, if ZTFJ1901+1458 were just two or three times farther away, we would not be able to make these precise measurements with our current set of observatories. For white dwarfs, it sets remarkable new records for size, mass, and magnetic field strength, but we also need to remind ourselves that we’re probing less than 0.001% of the white dwarfs in our galaxy at present.In the future, however, the next generation of observatories, including the Vera Rubin Observatory, will be able to make these types of measurements over volumes more than a hundred times greater than our current set of observatories can probe. Moreover, new and upgraded neutrino observatories might even be able to start measuring the neutrinos produced by the electron capture process acting on various elements supposedly within the white dwarf. The presence or absence of elements like neon, sodium, or magnesium could all affect not only the neutrino spectrum produced, but the fate, evolution, and possibly even the death of these massive white dwarfs.This is the smallest white dwarf ever found, and in theory they may be able to actually get as small as Earth’s moon, which has a radius that’s only about 20% smaller than this new record-holder of a white dwarf. Because of its fast rotation, its high temperature, and its strong magnetic field, it’s very likely that this white dwarf formed from the merger of two progenitor white dwarfs, and that the object we’re seeing now is no more than ~100 million years old: a blip in the lifetime of the Universe. This discovery not only helps us understand the ultimate fate and the cosmic extremes of the remnants of all Sun-like stars, but showcases the power of time-domain astronomy. If we can monitor objects sufficiently well to detect small changes on very short timescales, we’ll have the potential to uncover phenomena that we’d never see any other way. But if we modify the night sky too severely to make that task physically impossible — as our growing mega-constellations are currently in the process of doing — this information will likely remain elusive for years, decades, or even generations to come.I am a Ph.D. astrophysicist, author, and science communicator, who professes physics and astronomy at various colleges.

Contrary to current theories, researchers have determined that major collisions in the asteroid belt have not generally affected the number of impacts with Earth to any great extent.""The research community previously believed that meteorite flux to Earth was connected to dramatic events in the asteroid belt. The new study, however, shows that the flux has instead been very stable,"" says Birger Schmitz, professor of geology at Lund University in Sweden and one of the authors of the .To conduct the study, the researchers dissolved almost ten tons of sedimentary rocks from ancient seabeds in strong acids because the sediment contains residue from the meteorites dating back to when they fell to Earth.Meteorites contain a small fraction of a mineral, a chromium-oxide, which is very resistant to degradation. The microscopic chromium-oxide grains were sifted out in the laboratory and analyzed.""The dissolved sediment represents 15 periods over the past 500 million years. In total, we have extracted chromium-oxide from almost 10,000 different meteorites. Chemical analyses then enabled us to determine which types of meteorites the grains represent,"" says Schmitz.A couple of thousand meteorites land on the Earth's surface every year, and approximately 63,000 meteorites have been documented. Based on the chemical composition, it is believed that most rocks from space originate from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Collisions between asteroids send fragments into near-Earth orbit, where they eventuall are captured by Earth's gravity and finally impact on the surface. The researchers ""were very surprised to learn that only one of the 70 largest asteroid collisions that took place over the past 500 million years resulted in an increased flux of meteorites to Earth. For some reason, most of the rocks stay in the asteroid belt."" The study not only upends generally accepted meteorite flux theories; it also provides entirely new perspectives on which types of celestial bodies are at greatest risk of colliding with Earth and where in the solar system they originate. From a geological time perspective, kilometer-sized celestial bodies collide with the Earth on a regular basis. About 66 million years ago, , likely contributing to the demise of the dinosaurs. Impacts of a similar size are estimated to happen every 100 million years. . The 1908 Tunguska Event, one of the largest explosions ever recorded in history, likely was caused by a 200-meter-wide asteroid burning up in Earth's atmosphere. On August 10, 1972, an asteroid passed within 57 kilometers of Earth, causing a . The latest example is the Chelyabinsk impact, when a small asteroid (approximately 20 meters in diameter) exploded above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk in February 2013. The explosion generated a shock wave injuring about 1,500 people.""Future impact from even a small asteroid for example in the sea close to a populated area could lead to disastrous outcomes. This study provides important understanding that we can use to prevent this from happening; for example, by attempting to influence the trajectory of rapidly approaching celestial bodies,"" the study concludes.I'm a freelance geologist working mostly in the Eastern Alps.

"Amazon launches 'child-friendly' smart speaker in UK - Yahoo News Australia
Amazon is launching a child-friendly version of its Echo Dot smart speaker in the UK, several years after it was made available in the US.The speaker - which comes with either a panda or tiger design - is billed as a learning tool, allowing children ""to have fun and learn with Alexa"".But critics said that parents should remember that it will also be collecting data on their children.Amazon said it had imposed tight safety protocols on the device.""We conduct robust testing and research and have strict measures in place for Echo Dot Kids, Amazon Kids and Amazon Kids+ that protect children and provide parents with transparency and control over the experience, creating a safe space in which kids can learn and have fun,"" it told the BBC.Of the delay in releasing the product in the UK, it said: ""There are many elements and challenges that go into expanding into other countries and languages, particularly when it comes to content, services and features that are locally relevant.""The device comes with one year's worth of Amazon Kids, which offers Alexa-specific content such as child-friendly skills and audiobooks.It will also have parental controls which allow adults to block things such as explicit lyrics on music streaming services, as well as set time limits to prevent children from ""talking with Alexa late into the night"".The Magic Word feature rewards children who use the word ""please"" with positive reinforcement.However, privacy experts said parents should think twice before buying the device.""You may want to take a moment to consider whether this is a piece of technology you really want in your child's bedroom,"" said digital privacy expert Attila Tomaschek, from ProPrivacy.He added that the device would be recording a conversation it had with a child.""The cute speaker will collect, process and analyse this data, potentially even sharing it with various third parties,"" he said.But Amazon denied that would happen: ""We have built privacy and security deeply into the Alexa service. We never share voice recordings with third parties. Parents need to give permission to set up this device and can review, delete or choose not to have voice recordings saved at any time.""In 2019, a coalition of child protection and privacy groups filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, asking it to investigate the Echo Dot Kids. They said that while the device offered parental controls, it did not offer parents control over how Amazon interacts with their children's data.Echo Dot Kids will cost £59.99 and be available from 21 July.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dWnjAfnggC9S_qRRUSovdg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/fjR4R8q0pQQ0LTJJVL9IhA--~B/aD01NDk7dz05NzY7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/c447e5dbfb73397066908b15d97c9330,"Apple faces demand to bar its watch from US as patent fight widens - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Medical technology company Masimo Corp has stepped up its legal fight against Apple, filing a patent-infringement complaint at the US International Trade Commission that seeks to halt imports of the Apple Watch.Apple’s Series 6 smartwatch infringes five patents for devices that use light transmitted through the body to measure oxygen levels in blood, Masimo said in a complaint filed at the Washington agency. The patented technology is key to Masimo’s core business and Apple is unfairly copying the features, the company claims.Masimo, which develops signal-processing technology for health-care monitors, and its spinoff, Cercacor Laboratories, first sued Apple in January 2020, accusing it of stealing trade secrets and improperly using Masimo inventions related to health monitoring in its Apple Watch.Masimo says he public won’t be harmed if the Apple smartwatch is kept from the US market as it’s not an essential health device.The patents in the federal case are being reviewed by the US Patent and Trademark Office after Apple argued they didn’t cover new inventions. The judge put that aspect of the case on hold until the reviews are completed.Unlike a district court, the trade agency won’t delay consideration of the patent complaint and it typically completes investigations in 15 to 18 months. Conversely, if Apple decides to challenge these patents as well, the patent office is likely to decline any request for a review because the ITC works so quickly.The dispute is likely to end in a settlement that could net Masimo between $US50 million ($67 million) and $US300 million a year in royalties, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tamlin Bason said in a note on Tuesday. Masimo reported $US1.14 billion in sales last year.Apple denies that it stole any trade secrets or infringed the patents in the earlier case. Company officials didn’t immediately respond to queries seeking comment on the new case. The unit that includes sales of Apple Watch reported $US30.6 billion in revenue in fiscal 2020.As part of its ITC complaint, Masimo said the public won’t be harmed if the Apple smartwatch is kept from the US market because the pulse oximetry feature is “not essential to the public health or welfare.”“Apple heavily markets that feature of the Series 6 to give the watch the appearance of a medical device,” Masimo said in the filing. “Yet, hidden from the millions of purchasers of the Series 6, Apple warns in the fine print that the blood oxygen measurements should not be relied upon for medical purposes.”BloombergThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

As teams and businesses around the world prepare to return to the office, Slack has introduced several new tools aimed at supporting hybrid working so that organizations can adopt a digital-first approach to work.One of the things that employees miss most when working from home is being able to drop by a coworker's desk or catch up in the hallway for quick casual conversations before starting their day or having a meeting. While most  solutions now offer breakout rooms, talking in a small group just can't compare with the spontaneous and informal discussions workers once had at the office.For this reason, Slack is introducing a lightweight audio-first way to start live conversations called Slack Huddles. In just one click, users of the company's  will be able to start a huddle in any channel or direct message including those shared with workers from outside their organization. Just like in the office, anyone is free to come into and out of a huddle as they please almost as if they were walking by your desk. Slack Huddles also help give workers a break from  since they're audio-only.Whether it's on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, the endless stream of meetings while working remotely has worn employees out. Also finding a time that works for everyone can be difficult which is why Slack is bringing a new way to easily create and share video, voice and screen recordings using its service. When a recording is shared in Slack, anyone can watch it whenever they have time and this can be especially helpful for organizations with remote, distributed workforces.Figuring out who everyone is can be quite hard when starting out at a new company and working remotely has only made this worse.To give new employees and even company veterans more context into who they're working with, Slack has created Slack Atlas. This new feature enhances user profiles with rich dynamic information including a company's organizational structure, employee start dates and even custom fields. Slack is also giving paid teams the ability to schedule when recordings or messages are delivered so that workers can time their online interactions with one another based on everyone's schedules. If you know a co-worker has singed of for the evening, you can schedule a message instead of sending immediately so you don't disrupt their work-life balance.It's also worth noting that both Slack Huddles and recordings will offer live captioning so that everyone at an organization can feel included from the start.We'll likely hear more regarding Slack's major overhaul once the company begins rolling out all of the new features it has announced to make hybrid working a bit easier for both employees and their organizations.After living and working in South Korea for seven years, Anthony now resides in Houston, Texas where he writes about a variety of technology topics for ITProPortal and TechRadar.

We love laptops with high refresh rates, but the feature is tough on battery life. So Microsoft is adding a new setting in Windows 11 that’ll automatically lower the refresh rate for certain computing tasks and raise it for others. “With Dynamic refresh rate (DRR), you get the best of both worlds—a more natural and responsive inking experience along with smoother scrolling, all while minimizing battery usage,” Microsoft wrote in a blog post. The setting is a convenient alternative to manually lowering a laptop’s refresh rate. According to Microsoft, the DRR function will be smart enough to distinguish your computing tasks and calibrate the refresh rate accordingly. “For example, with a Dynamic (60Hz or 120Hz) mode, your display will refresh at 60Hz for everyday productivity tasks, such as email, writing a document, and so forth to conserve battery life,” the company wrote. “It will then seamlessly switch to 120Hz for tasks such as inking and scrolling, to provide a smoother and more responsive experience.”The Dynamic refresh rate setting is already rolling out through the Windows 11 preview build on the dev channel. But it’s still a work in progress. The setting currently only activates when you’re scrolling on Microsoft Office, and if you’re “inking” or digitally drawing with a stylus in Office, Microsoft Edge, and several other Microsoft and Adobe programs. It's unclear what other modes the setting may enable.The other limitation is how the setting can only be applied to laptops with a 120Hz or higher display panel that feature a variable refresh rate. The same laptops also need the Windows Display Driver Model 3.0 installed, which is available through Windows update. There’s also no reason to bring the function to desktop PCs, since they never suffer from battery life problems. “All your existing games will continue to run and perform like they always have because DRR does not apply to games,” the company added. Microsoft’s blog post has more details. On Windows 11, the setting can be turned on by going to Settings, and selecting System > Display > Advanced display. Then pick a refresh rate that has Dynamic in the name.",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/news/t/to-conserv/to-conserve-battery-life-windows-11-can-automatically-adjust_arf7.1920.jpg
"Berejiklian warns NSW: Please stay at home unless absolutely necessary - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is urging people to stay at home unless absolutely necessary after 24 new cases of COVID-19 were recorded on Thursday, with only half in isolation while infectious.Two new cases included a healthcare worker and an aged care worker, while the number of active exposure locations across the state swelled to more than 300. NSW Health on Thursday afternoon confirmed a person who attended the mass vaccination centre at Sydney Olympic Park on Tuesday, between 3.30pm and 5pm, tested positive the following day.Dr Chant also warned that all people who attended two shopping centres - Pacific Square at Maroubra between June 23 and 30 and the Auburn Central on June 28 - should get tested and isolate until a negative result is received.Ms Berejiklian said a number of people who had been in the community while infectious was a “cause for concern” and urged anybody who leaves their home to “assume that you have the virus, or that people you come into contact with have the virus.”“We can’t afford to have people who have the virus going about their business,” the Premier said.Another two health workers tested positive to COVID-19 yesterday, both linked to a case in an unvaccinated 24-year-old student nurse who worked at Fairfield Hospital and Royal North Shore Hospital, that was announced on Wednesday.Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said the nurse’s close friend, who worked at both hospitals and Royal Ryde Rehabilitation Hospital, had tested positive.“Extensive contact tracing has occurred around that nurse, and we have identified one healthcare worker who was present at the ward on the Sunday when she was close to completing her shift,” Dr Chant said. “It was pleasing that while infectious this person did not go to work.”An unvaccinated aged care worker at SummitCare facility in Baulkham Hills has also tested positive. Dr Chant said that 135 out of 149 residents at SummitCare were vaccinated.NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard during the COVID-19 update.Credit:Kate GeraghtyMore than 200 staff and patients at the hospitals have been identified as close contacts to date, with investigations and contact tracing ongoing.There were 59,941 tests recorded during the reporting period, a drop from 68,000 tests reported on Wednesday.“We just need people to be particularly vigilant, if you’ve got the mildest of symptoms, please do not go to work. Instead, get tested and isolate. Just because you have had a negative test on one day, it is important you get re-tested if you get subsequent symptoms,” Dr Chant said.On Thursday, Sydney Local Health District chief executive Dr Teresa Anderson confirmed a positive case had attended the NSW Olympic Park vaccination hub, but it had remained open.“The centre has been thoroughly cleaned and NSW Health is contacting casual and close contacts,” said Dr Anderson. “You must not attend if you have any symptoms, however mild.”On Thursday, Dr Chant also confirmed two passengers who travelled on a flight from the Gold Coast to Sydney last Saturday had tested positive after initially testing negative.The VA524 flight on Saturday afternoon was the same flight on which a flight attendant travelled while positive. Dr Chant said both passengers had been tested promptly after learning they were a close contact and had remained in isolation after testing negative on the initial test.“Again, this highlights the importance of us being able to find people very quickly, get them tested... and also the importance of maintaining that isolation when you have been asked to do so,” she said.“If you have been asked to isolate because you are a close contact of a confirmed case, you must not attend the vaccination centre. If you are casual contact of a confirmed case, you must have a negative COVID-19 swab result before attending the centre for a vaccination.”NSW Health announced a number of new exposure venues yesterday including several shops and food outlets in suburbs of Burwood, Lidcombe, Hurstville, Petersham and Leichhardt.A pool in Maroubra is also on the close contacts list, while a Bossley Park club has updated advice.There have been 195 locally acquired cases reported since June 16 when the first case of the Bondi cluster, a driver who transported international flight crew, was reported. Of these, 175 are now linked to the Bondi cluster.A NSW Police superintendent is one of the latest people to be fined for not wearing a face mask, after the officer was caught breaching the rules inside a fast food outlet. In total, 65 infringement notices were issued on Wednesday for breaching health orders, and of those 52 were $200 fines for failing to wear a fitted face covering.Stay across the most crucial developments related to the pandemic with the Coronavirus Update.
