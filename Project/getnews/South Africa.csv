In the previous year that number had been 10.76 part per million, for a decline of 47% in the incidence of counterfeit money in one year.The Sarb's target, as part of its mandate to maintain the integrity of the currency, is 12 parts per million.It had not changed how it measures or identifies counterfeiting, the bank told Business Insider South Africa. ""The constrained economic activity over this period has however impacted the circulation of currency and hence the expectation is that the identified counterfeits will adjust upwards in line with historic levels, as people and materials start to flow more freely.""During the course of the reporting year, The South African Bank Note Company delivered 892 million notes to the central bank, and The South African Mint Company, its metal counterpart, delivered 811 million coins.""Counterfeit prevalence is dependent on the design of a currency; the age of that series; and the structure of the cash industry,"" said the Sarb, in response to questions.In June, the , with enormous flows for wholesalers.Various card, fintech, and crypto-token companies, as well as new and existing banks, have promised to change that, by luring businesses and their buyers to one of a range of technologies they believe easier, more secure, and safer than cash. (Compiled by Phillip de Wet)",https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10972/e8a57afec4334961b2662c855b44e570.jpg,"'We won't go back until it's safe' — Rio Tinto closes SA operations over violence - TimesLIVE
Rio Tinto Group declared force majeure on customer contracts at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) after escalating violence forced it to suspend activity at the mineral sands operation in SA.MD Werner Duvenhage said the company was prioritising the safety of its 5,000 workers at RBM, which exports titanium dioxide slag used to create ingredients for products including paint, plastics, sunscreen and toothpaste.The closure of Rio’s only South African business follows the death last month of RBM manager Nico Swart, who was shot on his way to work.“It has become impossible for us to run the business,” Duvenhage said by phone. “We won’t go back until it's safe for our people.”The suspension of operations at RBM is a blow to the South African government’s efforts to attract new investment to the country. Violence around RBM forced the operation to temporarily shut in 2019, with work subsequently halted on a $463m (R6.60bn)  expansion project.In recent weeks, mining equipment and infrastructure has been destroyed and access roads blocked. SA mining operations are frequently dogged by community protests which relate to issues ranging from poor municipal services to labour conditions. Duvenhage said there have been reports that the latest violence may be connected to youth unemployment.RBM’s furnaces are  being run on low power as they can’t be shut down completely. The company is engaging  regional and national government to get a better understanding of the cause of the violence, Duvenhage said.SA’s mines and energy ministry didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg.For more articles like this, please visit bloomberg.com",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"VW Polo GTI Facelift First Official Images Released - Motor1
[UPDATE] Full image gallery and a video have been embedded. In addition, the technical specifications have been confirmed: 204-horsepower 2.0 TSI engine with 236 lb-ft (320 Nm), seven-speed dual-clutch automatic-only, and a 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) sprint in 6.5 seconds.It was a little over two months ago when Volkswagen introduced the facelifted Polo lineup in all but the range-topping GTI flavor. The hot hatch version is now making its world premiere in a rather unusual place as the images were shared on LinkedIn by Ralf Brandstätter, Chief Executive Officer Volkswagen Passenger Cars. At the moment of writing, only two photos have been published, showing the predictable design evolution of the amped-up Polo.Naturally, it gets the fully redesigned headlights and wider taillights of the regular supermini, but the design has been spruced up with the usual red accents, dual exhaust tips, and a honeycomb grille with built-in LED daytime running lights akin to the Golf GTI. Chunky two-tone alloy wheels with upgraded brakes featuring red calipers are also noticeable, as are the contrasting black mirrors and roof.Ralf Brandstätter is promising a “powerful TSI” engine, and he’s likely referring to a turbocharged 2.0-liter gasoline mill that produced 204 hp (152 kW) and 236 lb-ft (320 Nm) towards the end of the pre-facelift model’s life. The Polo GTI offered a six-speed manual gearbox for a while, but the clutch pedal was dropped and it will be interesting to see whether the updated model will also be a DSG-only affair.Images of the interior have not been provided, but we're expecting a standard digital instrument cluster, new climate controls similar to those of the updated Tiguan and Arteon, along with a 9.2-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system.VW has promised to unveil the revised Polo GTI before the end of the month, and since it's already June 30, the full debut must be imminent.

South Africa is moving with more urgency to stiffen oversight of cryptocurrency assets after a proliferation of scams.A new regulatory timeline foresees finalising a framework in three to six months, after the publication of proposals earlier in June that require public comment before approval, according to Kuben Naidoo, CEO of South Africa’s banking regulator, the Prudential Authority.“We are trying to put in place the regulatory framework quickly,” said Naidoo, who’s also a deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank. “Defining this as a financial product and then developing the regulatory framework is important.”The approach that’s taking shape means tougher rules could be imminent this year after a jolt of scandals that most recently included a suspected Ponzi scheme, which resulted in the disappearance of an estimated US$3.6-billion in Bitcoin (though the quantum is disputed).South African cryptocurrency service providers have been operating unchecked by regulatory powers even as the popularity of the asset class has taken off. Last year, the collapse of Johannesburg-based Mirror Trading International was called the biggest crypto-related scam of 2020 by blockchain data platform Chainalysis.“We are of the view that cryptocurrencies are risky and we want to ensure that the financial sector is aware of those risks and pricing for those risks properly,” Naidoo said. “We think it’s a market-conduct matter. It’s an investor-protection matter.”South Africa is tightening the screws on the industry as digital currencies move from the periphery of the finance world to the mainstream and face deeper scrutiny worldwide.In one of the most significant moves to date by a regulator amid a global crackdown, Binance Markets was banned on Sunday by the UK financial watchdog from doing any regulated business in the country. Huobi, one of the most popular cryptocurrency platforms in China, said on Monday that users in the country are prohibited from trading derivatives.Under global regulators’ plans to ward off threats to financial stability from the volatile market, banks will face the toughest capital requirements for holdings in bitcoin. Earlier this month, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that a 1 250% risk weight be applied to a bank’s exposure to bitcoin and certain other cryptocurrencies.Regulators in South Africa will first move to establish know-your-customer rules for crypto exchanges and create systems for the surveillance of the asset class in order to prevent money being laundered out of the country, Naidoo said. Thereafter, investor-protection guidelines and rules for managing capital risk in the banking sector should come into effect.Firms offering services related to digital currencies in South Africa have been eager for better rules to take shape and drive up trust in the asset class.“Any incidents of fraud draw attention to the importance of regulation and we hope that the clear guidelines in South Africa — and globally — could lead to wider adoption by enhancing stability and trust in the market,” said Marius Reitz, GM in Africa for Luno.“Regulations will also raise standards and barriers to entry and weed out bad actors or service providers with a low regard and capability to safeguard customer information and money,” Reitz said.  — Reported by Roxanne Henderson and Prinesha Naidoo, (c) 2021 Bloomberg LP",https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bitcoin-2156-1120-1.jpg,"'If we succeed in not going bankrupt, then that'll be great' says Elon Musk on Starlink - Business Insider South Africa

"One way to boost vaccination rates? Give workers paid time off, research suggests - CBS News
When it comes to convincing more Americans to get vaccinated against COVID-19, giving them paid time off could go a long way toward getting the U.S. closer to the herd immunity that experts say is needed as , new research shows.Roughly two-thirds of workers say their employer encourages vaccinations, but only half say they're being given paid time off to get the vaccine and recover from side effects. That's according to a nationwide survey of nearly 1,900 adults conducted this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation.Urging people to get a shot — and then ensuring they're not effectively penalized in taking the time to do it — appears to make a difference: About three-quarters of workers whose employers either encouraged vaccination or offered paid time off to get inoculated said they'd gotten at least one shot, KFF found. That's in contrast to the 41% vaccination rate for people whose employers didn't stress the importance of getting inoculated, and a 51% rate for workers who didn't get paid time off to get their jab.Workers without health insurance were less likely to be given paid time off to get vaccinated, with only a third reporting being compensated for the time needed to get the shots, according to Kaiser. Just 9% of workers reported being offered a cash bonus to get vaccinated, while 12% were offered another incentive. The findings echo a call by President Joe Biden, who in late April called on all employers to offer full pay to workers for time off to get vaccinated and recover from any side effects. To ease the financial burden on smaller employers, the White House also announced a paid leave tax credit to offset the costs for businesses with fewer than 500 employees.""Getting more Americans vaccinated isn't only up to the government. Even without requiring workers to get a vaccine, employers can play a role by offering paid time off to get vaccinated and encouraging their workers to do so,"" Kaiser Family Foundation CEO Drew Altman said in an emailed statement. Cigna is among the major corporations that have heeded the call, with the health insurer offering its roughly 65,000 U.S. employees . ""We are in a race against more contagious variants,"" Dr. Steve Miller, Cigna's chief clinical officer, said in a statement. More than 604,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University. Taking unpaid time off to get vaccinated is a  living paycheck-to-paycheck.  and Publix are offering cash and other incentives to entice their employees to get immunized. Other corporations including airlines and  that employees get vaccinated against the virus.Views are divided on whether employers should require workers to get vaccinated, with 51% of respondents telling KFF that employers should mandate vaccinations, except for when there's a medical exemption. Offering unvaccinated people  may also sway a significant portion of those still on the fence, KFF found. About 23% of those who have not been vaccinated said they would be more likely to get the shots if they were entered into a lottery with a chance to win $1 million, the survey found. Thirty-one percent of the ""wait-and-see"" group of unvaccinated respondents said they would be inclined to get the shots if that gave them a chance to win a lottery prize.",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"Common cold or Covid? Upper respiratory symptoms are growing more prevalent, docs say - NBC News
Doctors are beginning to notice Covid-19 cases that look more like a very bad cold, especially in areas of the country where the highly contagious delta variant is quickly spreading.While shortness of breath and other lung issues remain among the most worrisome Covid-19 symptoms, it appears upper respiratory complaints — marked by congestion, a runny nose and headache — may be increasing.""We've seen a number of folks with cold-like symptoms,"" said Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., an internist at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.The potential shift in symptoms is not to say that the illness should be brushed off as just a cold. Respiratory droplets emitted from coughs and sneezes can infect other, more vulnerable, people. And cases that start off mild can worsen and become more serious.""Covid can present in different ways,"" said Dr. Russell Vinik, chief medical operations officer at the University of Utah Health in Salt Lake City. ""If you think you have a cold, you're infectious, and whether that's Covid or a cold, you should consider getting a test.""Vinik has also seen more people coming in with cold-like symptoms. And previously typical Covid-19 symptoms such as loss of taste and smell are not as commonly reported anymore, he said.Both Hopkins and Vinik said their patients tend to be unvaccinated and skew younger than earlier in the pandemic.It is not clear why common cold symptoms are increasingly reported in Covid-19 cases, though some experts suspect it could be due to the delta variant, which now accounts for about 20 percent of new cases in the U.S. Arkansas and Utah, where Hopkins and Vinik are respectively based, have some of the highest rates of delta cases in the country, according to the .Indeed, in the United Kingdom, where delta is implicated in more than 95 percent of new cases, researchers say the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are now that of a bad cold: headache, sore throat, runny nose and fever.""What we've been seeing in the last month is very much a change in the symptoms,"" said Tim Spector, a professor of epidemiology at King's College London.Spector heads a project called the ZOE Covid Study, an app where users report symptoms, vaccination status and other demographic information daily. More than 4 million people in the U.K. have signed on, as well as about 300,000 people in the U.S.""We get a picture of where things are happening in real time,"" Spector said. ""We also get to hear about the commonest symptoms in different times of year and in different locations.""Spector's research finds that earlier symptoms, such as shortness of breath, persistent cough and loss of smell, ""have dropped out of the top five"" of the most common Covid-19 symptoms.The CDC has long included classic ""common cold"" symptoms of congestion and a runny nose on its list . A spokesperson told NBC News the agency has no immediate plan to change symptom guidance.Still, physicians in the U.S. are paying attention to what's happening in the U.K., which is ""two to three months ahead of us,"" Vinik said.Dunn agreed, adding that what is happening now in the U.K. could predict Covid-19 cases later this summer and into fall.It's also possible the shift in Covid-19 symptoms has nothing to with the delta variant. Now that most older adults have received the Covid-19 vaccine, new cases are skewing toward younger, mostly unvaccinated, adults. Younger people have generally been spared the worst of Covid-19.""Now that we have vaccinated all of those older people, you take their symptoms out of the mix,"" said Alasdair Munro, a senior clinical research fellow in pediatric infectious diseases at the National Institute for Health Research in the U.K.""People who would get those milder symptoms normally are now a much bigger proportion of everyone who gets infected,"" Munro said.Dr. Andy Dunn, a family physician and chief of staff at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper, estimates that three-quarters of his Covid-19 patients now are under age 50. He is also seeing an uptick in congestion associated with the virus.Most of Dunn's sickest Covid-19 patients are unvaccinated. Wyoming is one of the states with the lowest vaccination rates in the country; just over 30 percent of residents are fully vaccinated.Dunn said the combination of the low vaccination rate and societal unmasking has led to ""huge breeding grounds for more variants to evolve and to really grab ahold of a community that could have wiped this out with vaccines.""But even those who have been vaccinated are not entirely immune to Covid-19. While highly effective, the vaccines do not prevent 100 percent of infections. Breakthrough cases — infections in people who are fully vaccinated — can occur.""If you've been vaccinated and you have symptoms, don't discount them. You could still get Covid,"" Vinik, of the University of Utah Health, said.""Don't think you're immune to Covid just because you're vaccinated,"" he warned.That means even among the vaccinated crowd, a stuffed-up nose, sore throat, slight fever or fatigue may warrant a Covid-19 test.""Is it just a cold? Or is it Covid? We're not doing enough testing to have a good idea of how much Covid is circulating in our communities,"" Hopkins, of the University of Arkansas Medical Center, said.Spector, of the U.K.'s ZOE project, had more pointed advice.""If you're not sure it's a cold, I would assume it could be Covid,"" he said.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_26/3487848/210630-covid-test-uk-ew-306p.jpg","Study into whether animal drug can treat Covid - Bangkok Post

Reuters AMSTERDAM: The Netherlands will offer COVID-19 vaccinations to all children aged 12 to 17 in an effort to prevent a wave of infections due to new coronavirus mutations in the coming months.
The Dutch health council on Tuesday said children as young as 12 should be offered the Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, the injection which was authorised for use on children from the age of 12 by the European Commission in May.
""Taking everything into account we advise to offer the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to all 12-to-17-year olds who want one"", the council said.
A vaccination can help protect children against rare cases in which a coronavirus infection makes them seriously ill, the health council said.
Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge last week already said he would prefer to have teenagers vaccinated, to prevent new, possibly more contagious mutations of the virus to cause a wave of cases in the fall.
By offering vaccinations to children, the Netherlands would follow similar moves by the United States, Canada, France, Germany and other European countries who have already started injecting teenagers.
A total of around 15.3 million coronavirus vaccinations have been given in the Netherlands, with the country of 17.5 million en route to have offered at least one injection to all adults who want one by mid-July.

In this week’s royal update, the Diana Awards took place at a virtual ceremony, Queen Elizabeth opened the Argyll Museum during her tour of Scotland, Meghan Markle has listed her first and last name on daughter Lilibet’s birth certificate and a children’s book the Duchess of Sussex wrote in 8th grade has resurfaced.  The Diana Awards are held annually to honour young people who work to improve the lives of others. Named after Diana, the Princess of Wales, the award is the most prestigious accolade a young person aged 9-25 can receive for their social action or humanitarian work.Prince Harry made a surprise appearance at the awards on Monday during a virtual ceremony. He began his speech by acknowledging the brilliant work the nominees had done, thanking them for the change and difference that they make in others lives.Harry then went on to pay tribute to his late mother, whose birthday is coming soon and would have turned 60 this year.“Later this week, my brother and I are recognising what would have been our mum’s 60th birthday. She would be so proud of you all for living an authentic life with purpose and compassion for others,” Harry said.  It was announced sometime in 2019 that Meghan had removed her first and last name on her son Archie’s birth certificate and replaced it with “Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex”.

"Green light for R34bn SKA telescopes construction in SA, Australia - ITWeb
At a historic meeting of its council last week, the recently formed SKA Observatory (SKAO) saw its member states approve the start of construction of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescopes in South Africa and Australia.The SKA is an intergovernmental radio telescope project being planned to be built in the two countries. Conceived in the 1990s, and further developed and designed by the late-2010s, when completed, it will have a total collecting area of approximately one square kilometre.It will operate over a wide range of frequencies and its size will make it 50 times more sensitive than any other radio instrument.In a statement, the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) says the two telescopes, currently designated SKA-Low and SKA-Mid, names which describe the radio frequency range they each cover, will be the two largest and most complex networks of radio telescopes ever built.The cost of constructing the two telescopes and the associated operations and business-enabling functions will be €2 billion (R34 billion) over the period 2021 to 2030, says SARAO.SARAO believes the first significant activity on site is due to happen early next year, with construction of the telescopes lasting until 2028.The organisation says early science opportunities will start in the next few years, taking advantage of the nature of radio telescope arrays, also known as interferometers, which allow observations with only a subset of the full array.The telescopes are planned to have a productive scientific lifetime of 50 years or more.Procurement of major contracts for the SKA telescopes will start immediately, with some market surveys having already been conducted in the past few weeks.SARAO says over the coming months, some 70 contracts will be placed by the SKAO within its member states, with competitive bidding taking place within each country.The news comes as MeerKAT, precursor to the SKA radio telescope, continues to make ground-breaking discoveries.A new study using the MeerKAT radio telescope recently produced a striking image showing a combination of cosmic features never before seen, revealing unexpected details of the inner workings of enormous radio galaxies.SARAO notes the decision to approve construction follows the creation of the SKAO as an intergovernmental organisation earlier this year, and the publication of two key documents, the Observatory’s Construction Proposal and Observatory Establishment and Delivery Plan, last year.The documents are the culmination of over seven years of design and engineering work by more than 500 experts from 20 countries, to develop and test the technologies needed to build and operate the state-of-the-art telescopes.According to SARAO, 11 international consortia representing more than 100 institutions, including research labs, universities and companies from around the world, designed the antennas, networks, computing, software and infrastructure needed for the telescopes to function.“I am ecstatic. This moment has been 30 years in the making,” says SKAO director-general Professor Philip Diamond. “Today, humankind is taking another giant leap by committing to build what will be the largest science facility of its kind on the planet; not just one but the two largest and most complex radio telescope networks, designed to unlock some of the most fascinating secrets of our universe.“I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to making this possible over the past decades, from the early inception of the project until now, and in particular, all the teams who have worked so hard over recent years and powered on through a pandemic in very difficult circumstances to meet deadlines and make this milestone possible. I would also like to thank our member states for their vision and the trust they’re placing in us by investing in a large-scale, long-term research infrastructure at a time when public finances are under intense pressure.”“I would like to add my thanks to the members of the SKAO Council and the governments they represent,” says Dr Catherine Cesarsky, chairperson of the SKAO Council.“Giving the green light to start the construction of the SKA telescopes shows their confidence in the professional work that’s been done by the SKAO to get here, with a sound plan that is ready for implementation, and in the bright future of this ground-breaking research facility.”In addition to delivering exciting and revolutionary science, SARAO notes the construction of the SKA telescopes will produce tangible societal and economic benefits for countries involved in the project through direct and indirect economic returns from innovation and technological spin-offs, new high-tech jobs and boosted industrial capacity, among others.It points out that the well-documented impact prospect of the SKA Project (detailed in the construction proposal), outlining the multiple benefits already flowing to member states and their communities thanks to their involvement in SKA-related activities over the last few years, was a key part of the case for the project.“Today’s commitment by member states is a strong signal for others to get aboard and reap the benefits of participation in this one-of-a-kind research facility,” adds Cesarsky.Over the past few years, SARAO notes the excitement in the science community about using the SKA telescopes to answer some of the most fundamental questions about our Universe, has been growing.It explains that recent meetings have demonstrated this huge scientific interest, with close to 1 000 scientists taking part in the latest SKAO Science Meeting in March.More than 1 000 researchers from hundreds of institutions across 40 countries are involved in the SKAO’s Science Working Groups that are working to ensure the maximum science potential of the new observatory can be quickly realised.There has been significant engagement between the SKAO’s local partners, SARAO and Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and local communities in preparation for the start of construction.In SA, SARAO has a memorandum of understanding with Agri-SA, many of whose members own farms which share boundaries with the MeerKAT radio telescope core, or will host antennas as part of the SKA-Mid telescope in the three spiral arms.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Ancient Skull Discovered in China Represents New Human Species, Scientists Say - Caixin Global
Chinese scientists announced Friday that a fossilized skull dating back more than 146,000 years represents a new human species, shedding new light on mankind’s origins and evolution.An international research team led by Ji Qiang, a professor at Hebei GEO University (HGU), made the announcement in a paper, which was published in peer-reviewed scientific journal The Innovation. The skull was reportedly discovered in 1933 in Harbin, Northeast China’s Heilongjiang province, the paper said. The discovery has drawn much attention from experts. The new species is “closely related to Homo sapiens, laying a foundation for future study on the origin of Homo sapiens (our species),” Ji said.“This is a remarkable new piece in the jigsaw of human evolution, a fossil that will continue to add important information for many years to come. It is one of the best preserved of all ancient human fossils,” London’s Natural History Museum said in a report, citing human evolution expert Chris Stringer.Local media reported that the skull, which is 23 centimeters (cm) long and more than 15 cm wide, was originally found in 1933 during construction work for a bridge over the Songhua River in Harbin. HGU received the skull in 2018. Using geochemical techniques, Ji and his team ascertained that the skull was at least 146,000 years old, but no older than 309,000 years. It has large cranial capacity of 1,420 milliliters which puts it in the category of modern humans, the paper said. Researchers believe that the skull belongs to a male, about 50 years old, who lived on a forest-covered alluvial plain with a small group of people, Shanghai-based publication The Paper reported. Analyses showed that the skull belongs to an evolutionary branch different from other ancient human fossils found in China, such as Dali and Xiahe, forming a third East Asian lineage, the paper said. It is likely to be a new sister lineage of Homo sapiens and share the same ancestor with Homo, the research team wrote. The new species has been named Homo longi, or “Dragon Man,” after Heilongjiang province — or “black dragon river” province in English — where the skull was discovered.Ji previously wrote in the Journal of Geology that the well-preserved skull fossil provided critical evidence for understanding the evolution of humans and the origin of our species.Contact reporter Wang Xintong (xintongwang@caixin.com) and editor Lu Zhenhua (zhenhualu@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Get our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.Products & ServicesAbout UsTerms of UseMedia PartnersCopyright © 2019 Caixin Global Limited.

A few ISS astronauts recently set to work putting up a new solar array, and they took a timelapse to capture the moment. The pair of astronauts are Thomas Pesquet of the ESA (European Space Agency) and Shane Kimbrough of NASA, and they spent 6 and a half hours missioning about the outside of the station. First, they brought out some new solar arrays, aligned them, and put them into place. This was the bulk of the work. They then prepped a second attachment point to get a head start on the next array they will inevitably have to set up. At some point during the process, Shane’s helmet lights and camera, “partially detached” from his helmet, which might not sound like a massive deal to us earth dwellers, but if you drop something in space chances are you won’t see it again.

SpaceX is scheduled to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday afternoon, and it is expected to generate a barrage of sonic booms.Florida Today reports that the Falcon 9 rocket flight is scheduled to liftoff from the Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral's Space Force Station in Florida on Tuesday sometime during a 58-minute launch window that opens at 2:56 p.m. (ET). After lifting off, the rocket's booster will reportedly ""separate from the payload-hauling second stage"" and ""flip around.""Once it begins its descent towards the nearby Landing Zone 1, sonic booms may roar overhead as the rocket approaches the speed-of-sound barrier during its deacceleration towards the landing site. The pressure waves from the expanding and contracting air are likely to generate a shockwave that sounds like a thunderclap to anyone in the nearby area.""There is a possibility that residents of Brevard, Orange, Osceola, Indian River, Seminole, Volusia, Polk, St. Lucie, and Okeechobee counties may hear one or more sonic booms during the landing,"" SpaceX said in a warning statement Monday. ""But what residents experience will depend on weather and other conditions.""The sharp release of pressure after the build-up of air molecules creates the rumbling noise people hear as the sonic boom, according to NASA. The Space Agency compared the ripple effect of the air reacting to the rocket to that of a boat traveling through water, creating small waves that can turn into a larger single wave if the boat moves through the water before the waves are swept away from the point of impact.Falcon 9 is expected to generate three sonic booms during its descent, though spectators close to the landing pad are not likely to hear all three occurrences, as there will be a short time delay before the sound reaches their location. Plus, the intensity of the sonic boom is reduced by the distance that the shock wave travels.The Transporter 2 mission launching on Tuesday is expected to carry 88 small satellites into orbit following the launch of Transporter 1 in January, which deployed with 143 satellites in the rocket's payload fairing. While there are fewer on board this time, the latest mission is actually launching more mass to orbit than before, per SpaceX.Beyond this mission, Elon Musk has announced plans to launch  but not before SpaceX has  There's also a planned mission to return to the moon in 2024, and Adele Ankers is a freelance writer for IGN. Follow her on Twitter.",https://sm.ign.com/t/ign_za/news/t/the-big-uf/the-big-ufo-report-from-the-us-government-is-finally-here_2bec.280.jpg,"The Construction of the World's Biggest Radio Telescope Begins - Optic Flux
The world always needs more powerful tools to look deeper into the wonders of the Cosmos. Until only one hundred years ago, astronomers were sure that the Universe is infinite in space and time, and there’s no wonder why. All those clusters of stars and galaxies that we can see in the sky are enough to tempt anyone into saying that there’s no possible end to all of this mystery.But as the Big Bang Theory points to a version of the Universe with boundaries, constantly building new powerful telescopes is a “must”. After seven years spent for de design and engineering phase, the construction of the SKA (Square Kilometre Array) Observatory will finally begin next month, as the official website reveals.As you might have already guessed, the term “SKA” (standing for Square Kilometre Array) reflects the purpose to build a telescope across one square kilometre. More precisely, an array of antennas will be distributed across large distances.
The SKA Organisation continues to explain further, as cited by Jalopnik:The concept for the SKA dates back to the early 1990s, and although the original name remains, the science goals, concept and engineering behind the project have evolved over the years, resulting in the science requirements of today that call for 130,000 antennas and 200 dishes. After the first phase of construction, historically referred to as SKA1, the two arrays comprising the SKA will already have a combined collecting area of almost half a square kilometre. As antennas can be added to interferometers, a future expansion of the SKA would allow this collecting area to increase even further.Going all the way to the edges of the Universe with our insights, using powerful telescopes surely isn’t impossible. But figuring out what could possibly exist beyond those edges is one of the major challenges in astrophysics and science in general.",https://i0.wp.com/www.opticflux.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Abandoned-Trailer-Coming-June-22-e1624041937823.jpg?resize=280%2C210&ssl=1

Share this article:The Covid-19 lockdowns have kept us inside our homes and online for more than a year, so it is only obvious that we spent more time on social media. Last year saw a surge in the number of social media users, with billions of people spending more time than ever on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. The growth of the world’s largest social media platforms continued in 2021 with no signs of stopping in the years to come.According to data presented by StockApps.com, the combined number of Facebook, YouTube and Instagram users is expected to hit 5.7 billion this year. The trend is expected to continue in the following years, with the number of users growing by another 800 million to a staggering total of 6.5 billion in 2023.In 2019, popular social media platform Facebook had over 2.1 billion active users, revealed the Statista Key Market Indicators data. After Covid-19 pandemic hit, the number of Facebook users rose to nearly 2.3 billion. This figure is expected to hit 2.4 billion in 2021. By 2023, the number of people using Facebook is forecast to hit 2.63 billion, a 340 million increase in three years.Watching videos has also become a favourite pastime in lockdown and the statistics show it.  Last year, around 2.1 billion people worldwide had been using YouTube. Statista data indicated the number of people using YouTube is set to jump to 2.24 billion in 2021 and continue growing to 2.56 billion in 2023, a 15% increase in two years.And of course, lockdown is the great time for “doing it for the ’gram”. Instagram, as the third most popular social media platform in 2021, is the most rapidly evolving.Last year, the photo and video-sharing social networking app hit 926 million users. This is up by 140 million in a year. According to Sensor Tower data, Instagram was among the top five most downloaded apps in both the App Store and via Google Play last year.In 2021, Instagram’s user base is forecast to hit over one billion for the first time.

The companies feuded publicly over a proposal to force Google to pay news publishers for content and squabbled more quietly over technology for selling search ads.Neither company is eager to extend or renew the alliance, according to people familiar with each companies’ thinking, who weren’t authorised to discuss confidential relationships.As the two draw farther apart and the business rivalry between them escalates, Microsoft  and Alphabet’s Google may be drawn back into a persistent battle of behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts and public complaints to regulators, who are eager to impose new limits on the power of the biggest technology companies.From Microsoft’s side, the disputes are about giving marketers equal access to search engines when they organise campaigns with Google’s technology, and creating a robust ecosystem for content creators to get paid.Google believes Microsoft is objecting because it regards Google as a threat to Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing and Office productivity businesses.At a time when regulators are training their guns on the whole industry, Microsoft and Google handing them ammunition  against each other may backfire, leaving both companies and their peers subject to even more scrutiny.The first signs of strain between the two companies appeared more than two years ago, when Microsoft protested to Google that its Search Ads 360, which lets marketers manage advertising campaigns across multiple search engines, wasn’t keeping up with new features and ad types in Microsoft’s search engine, Bing.That meant it was easier and better for potential advertisers using that system to buy Google spots than Microsoft ones. It seemed to be happening when Bing’s capabilities caught up with an existing Google search feature, said Rik van der Kooi, vice-president of Microsoft Advertising. He estimates Google’s moves in ad tech are costing the software maker hundreds of millions of dollars in ad revenue every year. It impacts Bing as well as the Yahoo and DuckDuckGo search engines that use Bing technology.“If you want to advertise, if you want to sell advertising or buy advertising on the internet, you have to use Google’s tools, and when they make their tools in a manner that fails to interoperate easily with others, it impacts everybody,” said Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith in a Bloomberg television interview in April. “We raised the concerns with them and they just turned a deaf ear.”The companies’ expired agreement on ending existing hostilities and preventing future ones set out a formal, escalating process for handling disputes that might previously have gone directly to regulators.In the current ad-tech quarrel, Microsoft says the two companies followed that process but its concerns about Google’s product still weren’t addressed successfully.Even talks between the companies’ CEOs, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Google’s Sundar Pichai — the final step in the accord’s predetermined process — failed to produce a resolution.Under the peace treaty, only once all the efforts laid out in the accord have been exhausted could one company take its grievance to regulators.By 2020, Microsoft had spoken with UK officials and regulators in some US states about the ad-tech issue. A 2020 report about Google by the UK’s competition authority states that Microsoft expressed concerns that Google doesn’t update its SA360 technology with Bing’s latest features, which reduces the amount of money advertisers spend on Bing.Microsoft also said that Google provides quicker bid information to book ads on its website than on Bing. The UK conversations were in response to questions put to Microsoft, which was allowed in the agreement with Google, said a person familiar with the matter.Microsoft declined to comment on the terms under which it spoke to the US states. An antitrust suit from states led by Colorado against Google notes that Search Ads 360 (SA360) enables a sophisticated type of automated auction technology used to optimise bids only for Google “while withholding equivalent interoperability from Microsoft”.The Redmond, Washington-based software maker has said Google refused to change anything, while Google officials said the company is working to make the product better for customers.SA360 and the AdWords programming interface work with other search engines, Google said in a statement, adding that others don’t offer these kinds of tools. “We invest significantly to make these products available even though we’re not required to,” the company said. “Google continues to work to improve the customer experience for SA360, which includes responding to customer demand for new features for third-party search engines like Microsoft Bing.” The ceasefire’s demise and escalating tensions come against the backdrop of stepped-up regulation and antitrust activity against the biggest technology companies, including Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.com.Earlier in June, US legislators introduced several bills aimed at curbing their dominance and market power. The US justice department is accelerating a probe into Google’s ad market practices, according to people familiar with the matter.Microsoft has so far remained somewhat insulated from the scrutiny in the US, and hasn’t had to participate in confrontational congressional hearings where other CEOs were in the hot seat. People familiar with the company’s thinking say Smith and Nadella are eager to show regulators Microsoft hasn’t been guilty of the same behaviour that its rivals are being questioned about and to distance their company from other targets. Google, meanwhile, is growing more frustrated with the Microsoft attacks. In May, senior vice-president Kent Walker accused his rival of “naked corporate opportunism”. As competition between the two intensifies, Microsoft is “reverting to their familiar playbook of attacking rivals and lobbying for regulations that benefit their own interests”, he wrote in a March blog post.On Capitol Hill, Google has been among companies agitating for more scrutiny of Microsoft. Though Smith has said that should the antitrust bills become law, his company would be affected by some parts of them, Representative Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, is asking why the company has been getting a pass.On June 23, Jordan and other Republican committee members raised that issue in meetings to mark up various proposed bills to regulate big technology companies, saying it made no sense for Microsoft to evade scrutiny. Google has donated to Jordan’s campaigns since 2012, but said it was not behind his public comments last week. Microsoft has also given to several of Jordan’s campaigns.One member of the House committee, who asked not to be named when talking about private conversations, said a Google lobbyist brought up Microsoft, questioning why the criteria for a “covered platform” in the House bills appeared to exclude the huge tech company. The relationship between the two digital giants has gone through many twists and turns since Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionised the search engine in the late 1990s, dominating the digital advertising market in the process, and Microsoft realised it had missed out on a huge revenue opportunity.By the time Microsoft released its Bing search engine, in 2009, it was too late to be anything but a laggard. Then Google’s Android mobile software seized the market for smartphone operating systems — something Microsoft had tried and failed. The software company fought back in a variety of other ways. From 2012 to 2014 it ran an ad campaign designed by Mark Penn, a former adviser to the Clinton administration, called “Scroogled” — a portmanteau of Google’s name and the word screwed —which claimed that Google was spying on consumers. Microsoft complained to European regulators about Google and funded other complainants and groups opposing the search giant as regulators investigated the company.That pugnacious approach changed shortly after Nadella took over as CEO of Microsoft in February 2014 and Pichai was elevated at Google a year later. The companies felt the battle had become  expensive and distracting and, in some cases, embarrassing. There were also areas where they wanted to work more closely together. After taking over as CEO, Nadella began releasing Office apps for rival operating systems, which included Google’s Android.The two leaders reached a formal detente in April 2016 marked by a written agreement in which the companies settled outstanding patent issues and agreed to keep their competition to the realm of software. No longer would each try to gain an edge by siccing governments and agencies on the other. The accord was part of a peace mission by Nadella after he took the helm, designed to make relationships with Silicon Valley rivals less confrontational and enable Microsoft to partner more effectively. Nadella also made amends with Salesforce.com’s Marc Benioff, and there have even been some collaborations with Amazon.As recently as a year ago, the Google deal seemed to be enduring, at least outwardly, with Microsoft avoiding lodging public complaints about Google even as it put Apple’s App Store on blast. In May 2020, when Smith said European and US regulators should examine app stores in a public appearance in Washington, Microsoft spokespeople took pains to note to Bloomberg later that Smith was referring to Apple only.And Microsoft and Google continue to deepen their co-operation in other areas of their businesses. Microsoft’s Edge browser runs on Google’s Chromium technology and Microsoft now sells a phone called Duo that uses Google Android as its operating system.Last week, Microsoft announced its next Windows operating system will run apps that use Google’s Android — though Microsoft didn’t work directly with Google to accomplish that. The Android apps on Windows will be sourced from Amazon’s app store. And the people familiar with both companies’ thinking noted they weren’t closing the door completely on a new or extended truce.  Still, even before it expired, there was ample evidence that the deal was eroding. Already irked with Google over the digital ad limits, Microsoft took a different set of complaints public earlier in 2021 — Google’s refusal to comply with a planned Australian law that would have forced it to pay news outlets for content its sites and apps feature.Microsoft said Google’s public conduct there showed a similar intransigence to what it had seen more quietly over the ad tech dispute.Microsoft also posited that the continued deterioration of news outlets in the internet age is hampering free and democratic discourse. Google’s conflict with Australia happened a few weeks after the US Capitol riots in January, and Microsoft’s Smith drew a connection between the two. In March, Smith testified before the House judiciary committee about it. InsurgencyThe insurgency was “an assault on the Capitol and an assault on a peaceful transfer of power that in our view in part reflected an unprecedented amount of disinformation at a time when the country cannot rely on the traditional base of news and journalism, that has been a bedrock of American democracy since the country was founded,” he said in an April interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang. “So when we step back and look at all of these things together, this is a time to ask these questions because they matter for the web. They matter for the people who use the internet, and frankly they matter for the fundamental pillars of our democracy itself.”Protestations about free speech aside, Microsoft may also be trying to exploit Google’s heightened vulnerability to antitrust regulation around the globe.The company, is battling government claims of abuse of monopoly power from the US justice department and a group of states, and in Europe, Google faces a sweeping probe of its ad technology. Any new regulations or laws that weaken Google might give Microsoft leverage in markets where they increasingly compete for the same business.“We have a name for this in antitrust — we call this raising rivals’ costs,” said Randal C Picker, a law professor at the University of Chicago who studies tech antitrust and copyright issues, about Microsoft’s stance on paying for news content. “All of this is going to cost the Facebooks and the Googles of the world a lot more than it’s going to cost Microsoft. So that makes it look like a competitive move.”Google has chosen the area of cybersecurity to poke at Microsoft — Google’s Walker posted another blog in June cautioning customers that using one vendor for too many parts of their software stack puts them at greater risk of hacking.“As we saw with SolarWinds and the Microsoft Exchange attacks, proprietary systems and restrictions on interoperability and data portability can amplify a network’s vulnerability, helping attackers scale up their efforts,” Walker wrote, in a swipe at Microsoft.Mountain View, California-based Google may have other ways to hurt Microsoft. So far Microsoft’s large acquisitions, such as deals for LinkedIn and GitHub, as well as purchases of video-game studios, have passed through regulators without much scrutiny. But Google could choose to raise concerns about current and future deals, such as  Microsoft’s $20bn agreement to buy Nuance Communications, an artificial intelligence company meant to bolster Microsoft’s health care, cloud and AI efforts—all primary areas of competition with Google and Amazon.Google is also Microsoft’s biggest rival in the market for productivity software such as  word processing, e-mail and spreadsheets, possibly the only major field where Microsoft retains a dominant position. Already rivals like Slack Technologies  have complained to European regulators about Microsoft bundling new apps into Office to fend off rivals, and Google could chime in with any concerns it may have.“Microsoft is a huge company as well and it’s dominant in many areas. For example, Office is a dominant package in the market,” said Gus Rossi, a principal of responsible technology at Omidyar Network, a foundation and impact investment firm focused on social change.  “What Google can do is to remind everyone that Microsoft is also a bad actor, because if everyone is a bad actor, then you’re not such a bad actor.”Bloomberg News.

"Ramaphosa did not mislead on CR17, Mkhwebane cannot probe political parties' affairs, top court rules - TimesLIVE
President Cyril Ramaphosa did not mislead parliament in relation to the donation made to his ANC presidential election campaign in 2017.The public protector also did not have powers to investigate private affairs of political parties.These findings were made by the majority of the Constitutional Court on Thursday as it dismissed the appeal by public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane against a decision made by the Pretoria high court in March last year.The high court judgment reviewed and set aside Mkhwebane's decision to investigate and report on the CR17 campaign for the ANC leadership elected in December 2017.The full bench also reviewed and set aside her findings released in July 2019 that Ramaphosa deliberately misled parliament about the donation he received from Bosasa.That judgment reviewed and set aside Mkhwebane's decision to investigate and report on the CR17 campaign for the ANC leadership elected in December 2017.The full bench also reviewed and set aside her findings released in July 2019 that Ramaphosa deliberately misled parliament about the donation he received from Bosasa.The public protector was also ordered to pay punitive costs in the application.The case has its beginning in November 2018 when a question was posed to Ramaphosa in parliament relating to the payment of R500,000 into an account allegedly belonging to the president's son, Andile Ramaphosa.This payment was allegedly paid by the late Gavin Watson, who was CEO of Africa Global Operations (AGO), formerly known as Bosasa.In his response, Ramaphosa said his son was involved with AGO and that the payment was related to work he had done for the company.However, a week later, Ramaphosa wrote a letter to the speaker of the National Assembly informing her that the answer he had given in response to the question was incorrect. He explained that the payment was made on behalf of the late Watson to his CR17 election campaign. After the second reply, complaints were directed to the public protector to investigate Ramaphosa's conduct, alleging that he deliberately misled parliament.The scope of Mkhwebane's investigations was whether Ramaphosa, in giving an incorrect answer to the question directed to him in parliament, had misled parliament.In her report released in July 2019, the public protector found that Ramaphosa had deliberately misled parliament, in breach of the Executive  Ethics Code.Ramaphosa challenged her report.The high court found that the public protector's sphere of jurisdiction was limited to matters involving state affairs, the exercise of public powers or conduct occurring in any spheres of government.The high court held that the activities of the CR17 campaign were by nature the activities of members of a private group of people, and not a statutory body.The public protector appealed to the ConCourt against the high court judgment.Her appeal was heard on November last year.TimesLIVE",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"eSwatini streets deserted as anti-monarchy riots turn deadly: activists - Eyewitness News
MBABANE, eSwatini - The streets in eSwatini were deserted Wednesday and pro-democracy activists claimed eight people had been killed in clashes with police in the latest clashes in Africa's last absolute monarchy.Demonstrations, which had been relatively low key for weeks, escalated on Monday in the tiny and usually stable landlocked kingdom previously known as Swaziland.Protesters took to the streets in the kingdom's two largest cities, Mbabane and Manzini, to demand political reform.Police refused to confirm reports of the deaths and injuries, saying they do not divulge such information to international media.The government, which has deployed soldiers as angry crowds blocked traffic and looted shops, imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew -- citing rising coronavirus cases.But witnesses said violent clashes were continuing between protesters and police. Lucky Lukhele, spokesman for the pro-democracy Swaziland Solidarity Network, said eight activists had been shot dead overnight in Manzini.Lukhele said they were among around 28 protesters who had been shot, some of whom were taken to hospitals in the early hours of the morning.Internet access has been limited since Tuesday, he added, accusing the government of a shutdown.Wandile Dludlu, secretary general of the People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), said shops were closed and towns were ""run by soldiers"" on Wednesday.""Between yesterday and today we have got fresh reports of almost 18 people who have been shot,"" he told AFP.US CALLS FOR RESTRAINTBurning tyres barricaded the streets Wednesday afternoon, with the sound of gunshots heard sporadically on the deserted streets of Mbabane, according to an AFP correspondent on the ground.""We slept with the sound of gunshots and woke still to gunshots fired,"" said Mbongwa Dlamini, head of the Swaziland National Association of Teachers.""The looting and destruction of property became intense,"" he added.A brewery partially owned by King Mswati III was also torched, Dlamini said. In neighbouring South Africa, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) issued an ""urgent call"" for eSwatini authorities to move ""away from autocracy, strong handed crisis management and brutal repression of legitimate civilian concerns"".US State Department spokeswoman Jalina Porter called on the authorities there to ""exercise restraint"".""The United States urges all stakeholders in this situation to not only remain calm but also remain peaceful,"" she added.eSwatini has long stifled dissent and pro-democracy movements, with political parties banned since 1973, in the southern African country, where the king names government ministers and controls the parliament.But simmering frustration boiled over this month into sporadic demonstrations that prompted the government to forbid all protests last week -- a move that only served to stoke further anger.The ANC called for opposition political parties to be authorised and political activists to be released.Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.

CAPE TOWN - Western Cape Transport MEC Daylin Mitchell has written to Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula to raise concerns regarding the readiness of the Road Traffic Infringement Authority to implement the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences (AARTO) Act.The Act is meant to come into effect on Thursday, bringing with it a demerit system that will penalise drivers for breaking the law.But there's been no communication about what changes to or how exactly the law will be implemented. Mitchell said his department was strongly supportive of a points demerit system to improve driver behaviour and remained keen to implement any effective measure that would reduce road traffic injuries. “I am concerned that we have been severely hindered in our ability to plan meaningfully for the announced rollout of the Act, in particular with regards to training of our traffic officers,” he said. Mitchell said this was as a result of the fact that the applicable regulations had not been finalised.“This effectively makes it impossible for the department to be in a systematic manner for the rollout. We cannot develop a real world start date for implementation without the regulations being finalised,” Mitchell added. Activist group, Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) said the new traffic laws officially enacted on Thursday were likely to fail. Outa said while measures to improve road safety and reduce fatalities were urgently needed,  it believed the Act would not achieve this as it was rolled out in Gauteng 10 years ago and failed spectacularly. Outa's Advocate Stephanie Fick said the legislation, which sets up the system, had not yet had an official start date gazetted, which meant if it's implemented on Thursday as previously confirmed by Mblalula, it would be a last-minute authorisation.“Last minute is not the way to start such a complicated process, particularly as this relies heavily on failed systems,” she said.Fick said authorities weren't ready for this, and it was subject to a Constitutional Court challenge that's due to be heard in October this year. On this basis, Outa asked the minister responsible for implementing AARTO Act to hold off on the rollout. But said to date, no response had been received.
