"After LA Clippers are eliminated, Paul George says team would 'be going on' if Kawhi Leonard was healthy for Western Conference finals - ESPN
LOS ANGELES -- Not long after Chris Paul and the Phoenix Suns celebrated their Western Conference championship on the Staples Center floor, Paul George wondered ""what if"" Kawhi Leonard had been healthy.The LA Clippers ran out of gas and comebacks as their resilient playoff run came to an end with Wednesday's 130-103 loss to the Suns in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals.After the game, George allowed himself to think about the possibilities had Leonard not sprained his right knee in Game 4 in the previous round against the Utah Jazz.""We'd be going on,"" George said when asked what would have happened had Leonard played in the conference finals. ""This series would be a lot different. Talk about one of the best players in the league being out, yet we were inches away from getting to the next round.""So, definitely it's a 'what if' on this. Fact of the matter is we didn't do enough to win, and that's the reason we're going home.""The Clippers, the only team to overcome a 2-0 deficit twice in the same postseason, could not force a Game 7 against the Suns. Injuries and tired legs caught up to them. Besides Leonard missing the final eight games with his knee injury, the Clippers were without centers Ivica Zubac (sprained right MCL) and Serge Ibaka (back surgery).And they were playing their 15th game in 29 days, as all three of their rounds went six games or more.Still, Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said his players were stunned once the realization set in in the locker room that the season was finally over only two wins away from the NBA Finals.""It is a shock,"" Lue said. ""I think it's a shock to a lot of guys in that locker room. It just tells you a lot about the team. Like no matter who is playing, we still feel like every night we have a chance to win no matter who is on the floor. I thought we ran out of gas, and first thing goes when you get tired and fatigued is mentally. That first half, we made a lot of mistakes defensively, a lot of mistakes coming out of timeouts or just playcalls, in general; just not there mentally.""The Clippers had their share of defensive breakdowns, and Paul made his old team pay for each of them. He delivered a masterful second-half performance that was classic CP3, complete with all the things that make him such a pain for opponents. He buried 12 of 16 shots, including all five of his 3-point attempts, and scored 31 of his 41 points in the second half.After he drilled a 3-pointer to push the Suns' lead to 118-92 with 5:49 left in the contest, the Clippers called for timeout. As Paul walked back to the Suns bench, a frustrated Patrick Beverley shoved the Suns point guard in the back and was ejected.Knowing that he had gotten under the Clippers' skin, Paul would celebrate moments later by pumping both of his fists in the air.All George and Leonard could do was watch from the bench.George was terrific this postseason, especially once Leonard went down. The Suns sent some double-teams at George, who finished with 21 points and nine rebounds on Wednesday. Still, George answered even his harshest critics with his finest postseason, lifting the Clippers to their first-ever Western Conference finals.""Nothing that I didn't know already,"" George said of what he learned from this postseason. ""The narrative of me not being postseason player or all that, I never understood it.""""[But] I came up short again,"" George later added. ""I'm proud of what we did as a team. I wasn't out to prove nothing to nobody but to show up as a leader for this team and to put us in position to get to where we got to. Again, came up short. My good wasn't enough. There's room for improvement ... I'll look back. I'll reflect.""Moving forward, the Clippers will see what Leonard will do with his player option for the 2021-22 season.Also to consider is the future of point guard Reggie Jackson, who emerged as a clutch scorer for the Clippers this postseason. The Clippers have early Bird rights on Jackson. George, though, said his good friend likely has played himself into having plenty of options for his future.An emotional Jackson, who has revived his career with the Clippers, had tears rolling down his face when asked about his future with the team.""This year was my best year,"" said Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points and 41.5% 3-point shooting in the postseason entering Game 6.""First thing I told these guys was thank you for saving me,"" he said. ""I appreciate every guy in that locker room. I appreciate Paul for getting on that phone last year, at the end the season -- [when I] was talking a buyout with Detroit.""I'm thankful for everything I've experienced being here; this city making me feel at home. This organization welcoming me, my quirks, my strengths, my weaknesses; I wonder if I would still be playing without this team.""George said the Clippers have all the players to make another title run next season, if they are healthy. After melting down and blowing a 3-1 lead in the Florida bubble in the second round last year, the Clippers' resiliency this postseason put all the ""bubble talk"" behind them, as Lue said.And George and Leonard saw what they are capable of doing when healthy.""We've made great connections,"" George said. ""I think we've both grown, myself and Kawhi together. I think we really enjoy being teammates, and we see what we can be and what we can do.""George later mentioned the team's injuries, stating, ""I thought this team squeezed everything we could out of what we had. We squeezed everything out of one another, and I thought we got stronger and better as the season went on.""",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"RJ Barrett Trade Rumors: Knicks Interested in Packaging SG in Deal for Lillard, Beal - Bleacher Report
The New York Knicks would reportedly be interested in including shooting guard RJ Barrett in a trade for a star guard such as Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard and Washington Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal.Kristian Winfield of the New York Daily News relayed the reported interest from a league source on Wednesday.The Knicks selected Barrett, 21, with the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The guard started all 72 games and averaged 17.6 points on 44.1 percent shooting (40.1 percent from three-point range), 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game last year.Trade rumors are circulating around Lillard following a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports that dropped Sunday.""The enormous backlash from the Portland Trail Blazers' process to hire a new coach and his concerns on whether a championship contender can be built have become factors that may push the franchise player—Damian Lillard—out the door, league sources told Yahoo Sports.""The 31-year-old Lillard, a six-time All-NBA player, averaged 28.8 points and 7.5 assists per game for the Blazers last year.

We do not sell or share your information with anyone. OMAHA — It began as a baseball game.It ended as a wild, maroon and white celebration.After 129 years of playing college baseball — mostly high quality baseball — Mississippi State claimed its first national championship in any team sport Wednesday night. The Diamond Dogs body-slammed defending national champion Vanderbilt 9-0, as more than 20,000 Bulldog fans roared their approval. State fans cheered, they chanted, they clapped, they high-fived, they hugged, they sang, they danced.And some cried.The last few days, they have painted Omaha, a 13-hour drive from Mississippi, solid maroon.


The 2021 Bulldogs have accomplished what so many Bulldog legends — and so many splendid Mississippi State teams — could not. Will Clark and Rafael Palmeiro, Thunder and Lightning, couldn’t do it. The great Ron Polk, in two stints as State’s coach, couldn’t do it. John Cohen couldn’t do as a player or a coach – but he did as an athletic director. He hired the guy who finally did it: Chris Lemonis.These Bulldogs all did it. They endured COVID-19. They came back from losing three straight to Arkansas, two of three to lowly Missouri and then two straight in the SEC Tournament. They got hot at the right time, winning  an NCAA Regional, a tough Super Regional with Notre Dame and their half of the CWS bracket where they had to be tradition-rich Texas twice.They came back from losing their first game of this CWS Championship series by an 8-2 score to Vandy. As their coach Chris Lemonis has said so many times here lately: “Nothing comes easy for this team. We keep fighting.”He added to that postgame Wednesday. “We’re the last ones standing,” Lemonis said. “It’s a special night for all of us. There’s gonna be a big party tonight.”They won the national championship with their 50th victory of the year. They finished 50-18.These Bulldogs will be talked about for decades. Some may have reached legendary status already.Decades from now State fans will talk about how Will Bednar came back on three days rest and pitched six innings of no-hit baseball against the defending national champions. They’ll talk about how Landon Sims almost preserved the no-hitter. They’ll talk about the sharp-fielding Bulldogs played error-less, sometimes spectacular defensive baseball for the entire College World Series.And so many of them — especially the younger ones — will talk about how they were here when it happened. How they helped will their heroes to victory.In Starkville, they call it the Dude Effect. They brought it here to what they now call Dudy Noble North. The effect is real. It encourages State players to achieve feats they might not otherwise achieve. It causes skilled players on the other team to bobble the ball on plays they normally make in their sleep.It surely causes people around the nation who are tuning in to ESPN to wonder: Who cares this much about college baseball?Mississippi people, that’s who.Bednar was nails, sharp ones. After a shaky start in the first inning when he walked two batters and needed a double play to get out of the inning, he dominated Vanderbilt. Get this: He retired the last 15 batters he faced. His fast ball was good. His slider was devastating. Vandy couldn’t touch it, and they couldn’t lay off of it either.Conversely, State stuck to its obvious plan of attack against Vanderbilt pitching hero Kumar Rocker, a legend himself. They “spit on” Rocker’s hard-breaking slider that often looked like a strike before dipping out of the strike zone. They waited on his fastball — in the strike zone — and then made him pay.Rocker lasted 4.1 innings, 92 pitches. Rowdey Jordan laced Rocker’s first pitch — the first of the game — into right field for a ringing single. He scored later in the inning on Luke Hancock’s sacrifice fly. The tone of the game was set.State added two more runs in the second, two more in the fifth, when they chased Rocker from the game. All the while, State fans got louder and louder and louder. In the seventh inning when both Logan Tanner and Kellum Clark clobbered home runs, you literally could not hear your own voice. It was that loud, like the fourth quarter of a really close SEC football game.When Sims recorded the last out, State players rushed the field, celebrating in a sure-enough ‘Dog-pile around pitchers’ mound. They had done it. At last. And you know what dear ol’ Jack Cristil would have said: “You can wrap this one up in maroon and white.”Here in Omaha, on June 30, 2021, Mississippi State’s Bulldogs and their legions of fans did just that.

"After Losing China, Uber’s Stake in DiDi Reaps $8 Billion in IPO - Yahoo Finance
(Bloomberg) --Five years ago, Uber Technologies Inc. bowed out of the world’s second-largest economy by selling its China business to rival DiDi Global Inc. in exchange for a stake in the company. Now, the U.S. ride-hailing company is cashing in on its trade.Didi, the biggest ride-hailing company in China, raised about $4.4 billion in its U.S. initial public offering on Tuesday and sold more shares than it originally planned. Didi’s stock closed up 1% at $14.14 on Wednesday, giving the company a market value of about $68 billion.That makes Uber’s current 12% stake worth about $8.1 billion. Didi’s public offering is the second largest U.S. listing by a Chinese company, behind Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $25 billion debut in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Founded in 2012 by Cheng Wei, Didi emerged as Uber’s biggest rival in China at a time the San Francisco-based company was vying to expand globally. In their battle for market share, Uber burned through billions of dollars before stopping its losses by selling Uber China to Didi, known as Didi Chuxing at the time. The deal left Uber with a 20% stake in its competitor. Uber has been selling some of its shares in Didi in the run-up to the IPO, reducing its holding from about 14% in the first quarter.Though Didi is dominant in China, momentum in the region is beginning to slow. The company plans to use the IPO funds to invest in technology, increase its presence in some international markets and introduce new products, according to its U.S. filings.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c0OwgVpXSWr1up.1rNB6DQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MC4zMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x26OKli.3yOIYrNfwGBoaA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/3dc78058c93af5d880b0423b783cb893,"Financial regulator hits Robinhood for $70 million for ""widespread and significant harm"" to customers - CBS News
The stock-trading app Robinhood was ordered to pay nearly $70 million Tuesday by financial regulators for misleading its customers, causing them to lose millions of dollars.A major player in the recent stock market frenzy, Robinhood says its mission is to stand up for the little guy and ""democratize finance."" But in a 123-page complaint, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Robinhood inflicted ""widespread and significant harm"" to millions of customers by providing them with false information about their investments. FINRA, which has federal authority to regulate financial firms, said the company also failed to reasonably maintain its technology and neglected to do proper due diligence before approving customers for complex trades called options.FINRA said the fine is the largest it has ever levied and ""reflects the scope and seriousness of Robinhood's violations."" A CBS News investigation in February  that left users to navigate high-risk trades by themselves.One of those users was 20-year-old Alex Kearns, who died by suicide last year after mistakenly believed he'd lost nearly $750,000 in a risky bet on Robinhood. When his account flashed red, Kearns tried to email the company's customer service three times to ask if his negative balance was accurate. He received no response and took his own life, writing in a suicide note that he believed he had financially ruined his family. In an exclusive interview with ""CBS This Morning"", Kearns' mother and father said the company was responsible for their son's death.""I lost the love of my life. I miss him more than anything,"" Dorothy Kearns said. ""I can't tell you how incredibly painful it is. It's the kind of pain that I don't think should be humanly possible for a parent to overcome.""The FINRA complaint specifically highlighted the Kearns' case. The regulator said Robinhood violated regulatory rules by providing customers like Kearns ""false and misleading information"" that ""concerned a variety of critical issues, including … how much cash was in customers' accounts … the risk of loss customers faced in certain options transactions, and whether customers faced margin calls.""Following the CBS investigation, Robinhood In settling with FINRA on Wednesday, the company neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.Robinhood said in a statement to CBS News on Wednesday it ""has invested heavily in improving platform stability, enhancing our educational resources, and building out our customer support and legal and compliance teams. We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all.""As part of the overall settlement with the company, the regulator ordered Robinhood to pay more than $12 million in restitution to Kearns and thousands of other customers.""This action sends a clear message—all FINRA member firms, regardless of their size or business model, must comply with the rules that govern the brokerage industry, rules which are designed to protect investors and the integrity of our markets,"" said FINRA's Head of Enforcement Jessica Hopper in a statement.

Kitco NewsShare this article:
(Kitco News) Gold attempted to recover some of its early-morning losses as the U.S. pending home sales surprised on the upside in May.
The U.S. pending home sales were up 8% in May, rebounding after April’s 4.4% drop, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said on Wednesday. Consensus forecasts were calling for a decrease of 0.8%.
The pending home sales index came in at 114.7 in May, marking the highest May reading since 2005.
Also, pending home sales were up 13.1% from a year ago as low mortgage rates drove demand.
""May's strong increase in transactions – following April's decline, as well as a sudden erosion in home affordability – was indeed a surprise,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. ""The housing market is attracting buyers due to the decline in mortgage rates, which fell below 3%, and from an uptick in listings.""
Even all-time high housing prices and record-low inventories are not stopping the buyers from lining up, added Yun.
""While these hurdles have contributed to pricing out some would-be buyers, the record-high aggregate wealth in the country from the elevated stock market and rising home prices are evidently providing funds for home purchases,” Yun said. ""More market listings will appear in the second half of 2021, in part from the winding down of the federal mortgage forbearance program and from more home building.
Pending home sales were the strongest in the Northeast, rising 15.5% on a monthly basis in May. The index also rose 6.7% in the Midwest. 
Economists pay close attention to the pending home sales numbers because the index is seen as a forward-looking barometer for the housing market. A lag of a month or two usually exists between a contract and a completed sale.
Gold prices edged up after the data were released, trading largely flat on the day. August Comex gold futures were last at $1,762.80, down 0.05% on the day.

They still need to protect themselves,” said Dr. Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general, during a news briefing Friday.The Centers for Disease Control, however, that they no longer needed to wear masks indoors.

A virus task force with representatives from top automakers and the United Auto Workers union made the decision Monday. It’s effective July 12.►Indonesia needs to urgently increase medical care, testing and vaccinations as new infections in the country surge because of the spread of the delta variant, which has left it “on the edge of a COVID-19 catastrophe,” the Red Cross said Tuesday.►Working-age women put in an average of 173 hours of additional unpaid child care through October of last year, a new report estimates.►Almost 5,000 people are in quarantine after vacationing high school students triggered a major COVID-19 outbreak on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, a senior official said Monday.►Italy on Monday lifted its outdoor mask mandate as cases drop and vaccinations rise in the country which experienced a horrific surge at the beginning of the pandemic.►Hong Kong says it will ban all passenger flights from the U.K. starting Thursday as it seeks to curb the spread of new variants of the coronavirus.►U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Monday that Puerto Rico will receive nearly $4 billion in federal education pandemic relief funds to help boost the U.S. territory’s fight against COVID-19.📈 Today's numbers: The U.S. has more than 33.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and at least 604,100 deaths,  The global totals: More than 181.3 million cases and more than 3.92 million deaths.

Because many families of color chose to stay remote even if in-person instruction was offered, it's likely an even smaller fraction of their children received any in-person learning this past school year.The figures are important because reduced access to in-person learning has become increasingly associated with poorer learning outcomes and adverse mental health and behavioral development.The latest counts underscoring racial disparities in learning modes are from a government survey of 1,200 school districts in 50 states and Washington, D.C. They're paired with a strong dose of health advice from the CDC: Schools need to intensify vaccination efforts and other measures to reduce community transmission.-- Erin Richards, USA TODAYThe Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is effective against all variants of COVID-19, including the delta variant, which is thought to be more contagious,The study analyzed serum samples from eight participants one week after they received their second dose of the vaccine. Researchers found the shot produced neutralizing antibodies against all variants, including the three lineage variants first identified in India, the beta variant first identified in South Africa, and the two variants first identified in Uganda and Angola.“These new data are encouraging and reinforce our belief that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should remain protective against newly detected variants,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a statement. “These findings highlight the importance of continuing to vaccinate populations with an effective primary series vaccine.”Several of Australia's major cities are under COVID-19 lockdown following a recent outbreak of the delta variant.Perth, the capital of Western Australia, began a four-day lockdown Tuesday and made masks compulsory after a resident tested positive, according to Reuters. Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, will also enter lockdown Tuesday.South Australia imposed new statewide restrictions Tuesday. Sydney in the east and Darwin in the north both locked down on Monday. Canberra made wearing masks compulsory.Most of the new cases are linked to an unvaccinated Sydney limousine driver who tested positive June 16 after transporting a foreign air crew from the airport while reportedly not wearing a mask.Australia has been relatively successful in containing clusters throughout the pandemic, registering fewer than 31,000 cases since the pandemic began. But the new clusters have highlighted the nation’s slow vaccine rollout, with only 5% of the population fully vaccinated.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines created a long-lasting immunity that may protect people from COVID-19 for years, a new study found.The new results mean that people who received the mRNA vaccines may not need boosters so long as variants do not drastically evolve.As for those who recovered from the coronavirus and received the vaccine later on, a booster may not be needed even as the virus mutates, the study's results suggest. The study, published in the Nature journal, didn't consider the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in its research, but it's expected to be less durable.“It’s a good sign for how durable our immunity is from this vaccine,” Ellebedy told New York Times.Nearly all Wisconsinites — or not fully vaccinated — state health officials said Monday.And just 1% of all confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases since Jan. 1 have been among those who were fully vaccinated, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health Services said.The stark news came as Wisconsin finally reached a significant milestone Monday, with 50.1% of the state's population receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.Between March 1 and June 24, 95% of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths were among those who weren't fully vaccinated, DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email.""The science is clear: vaccines work in the real world. They save lives,"" Goodsitt said. ""And if you are fully vaccinated, you are protected. All three vaccines have been tested and proven to be safe and effective.""Goodsitt added: ""Take a look at the COVID-19 data and you will see that cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have been declining since vaccines were authorized and we started getting shots in arms.""- Mary Spicuzza, Milwaukee Journal SentinelContributing: The Associated PressThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: ",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"LISTING OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRESS RELEASES - Los Angeles County

  Of the two new deaths reported today, one person that passed away was over the age of 80 and one person who died was between the ages of 65 and 79. To date, Public Health identified 1,250,240 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,483 deaths.     
  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more.

Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  While the increase in community transmission is concerning, Public Health notes the increases are still far below the surge levels over the winter of over 15,000 new cases and the test positivity rate of 20%.    
  Of the two new deaths reported today, one person that passed away was over the age of 80 and one person who died was between the ages of 65 and 79. To date, Public Health identified 1,250,240 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,483 deaths.     
  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  Of the two new deaths reported today, one person that passed away was over the age of 80 and one person who died was between the ages of 65 and 79. To date, Public Health identified 1,250,240 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,483 deaths.     
  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.

If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.

A judge has denied Britney Spears' request to have her father Jamie Spears removed from his role in overseeing her conservatorship, a court filing has shown. The 39-year-old singer's lawyer had asked a court in Los Angeles to oust Jamie from his position in managing his daughter's multimillion dollar estate.In court filings, Spears said she wanted private wealth management firm the Bessemer Trust appointed as “sole conservator”.Watch: Britney Spears' co-conservator Jodi Montgomery denies policiesHowever, documents filed in Los Angeles show Judge Brenda Penny refused the request while agreeing to Bessemer Trust’s role as co-conservator of the estate.The legal document states: “The conservatee’s request to suspend James P Spears immediately upon the appointment of Bessemer Trust Company Of California, N.A. as sole conservator of estate is denied without prejudice.”Read more: Spears has been under the conservatorship, which controls her financial and personal affairs, since 2008 after experiencing a series of mental breakdowns.Jamie stepped down as his daughter's personal conservator in 2019 with care professional Jodi Montgomery replacing him. Last week the mother-of-two delivered a 23-minute testimony calling for the end of the conservatorship. She claimed it was an ""abusive"" arrangement and that she was not permitted to remove her IUD to try for another baby or marry boyfriend Sam Asghari. ""I just want my life back,"" she said while speaking via telephone. Her father's lawyers have asked the court to investigate the star's claims of abuse. Watch: Christina Aguilera speaks out in support of Britney Spears""Either the allegations will be shown to be true, in which case corrective action must be taken, or they will be shown to be false, in which case the conservatorship can continue its course,"" a court filing reads.Read more: ""It is not acceptable for Conservators or the Court to do nothing in response to Ms Spears' testimony.""With additional reporting by PA.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/l4gDBN.WmOGc4RYIWKqhbA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTUwNS4zMDM4OTkwODI1Njg4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/a42dd2a0-1ff0-11ea-94d7-77725399e299,"Bill Cosby Freed From Prison After Sexual Assault Conviction Overturned By Pennsylvania Supreme Court - CBS Philly
PHILADELPHIA (CBS/AP) — Bill Cosby has been freed from prison after Pennsylvania’s highest court overturned his sexual assault conviction Wednesday. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that they found an agreement with a previous prosecutor that prevented him from being charged in the case.The country watched — some cheering, some dismayed — as Cosby was shackled and lead into prison more than two years ago. Just this afternoon, he was released from the State Correctional Institution Phoenix with little fanfareCosby has served more than two years of a three- to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia. He had vowed to serve all 10 years rather than acknowledge any remorse over the 2004 encounter with accuser Andrea Constand.The opinions of the court blasted light on a press release issued by former District Attorney Bruce Castor more than 15 years ago. The document essentially promised that Cosby would not be prosecuted.Years later, Cosby then testified in a deposition and did not take the Fifth Amendment. He made incriminating statements, and those statements became the foundation of prosecutions against Cosby as it related to the accused indecent aggravated assault of Constand.Legal experts say the prosecution was essentially a violation of a written contract between the DA’s office and Cosby.The Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office released a statement on Cosby’s release:
The majority decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court orders the release of William H. Cosby Jr. from state prison. He was found guilty by a jury and now goes free on a procedural issue that is irrelevant to the facts of the crime. I want to commend Cosby’s victim Andrea Constand for her bravery in coming forward and remaining steadfast throughout this long ordeal, as well as all of the other women who have shared similar experiences. My hope is that this decision will not dampen the reporting of sexual assaults by victims. Prosecutors in my office will continue to follow the evidence wherever and to whomever it leads. We still believe that no one is above the law—including those who are rich, famous and powerful.The 83-year-old Cosby, who was once beloved as “America’s Dad,” was convicted of drugging and molesting Constand at his suburban estate.Constand and her legal counsel released a statement on the court’s ruling Wednesday evening.“Today’s majority decision regarding Bill Cosby is not only disappointing but of concern in that it may discourage those who seek justice for sexual assault in the criminal justice system from reporting or participating in the prosecution of the assailant or may force a victim to choose between filing either a criminal or civil action.On the one hand, the Court acknowledged that the former District Attorney’s decision to not prosecute Mr. Cosby was not a formal immunity agreement and constituted at best a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute at the time, but nevertheless precluded a future prosecution, which included additional evidence developed in the civil case. the Supreme Court acknowledged that it was bound by the lower court’s credibility findings, including that Andrea Constand and her civil counsel, Dolores Troiani and Bebe Kivitz, were not privy to any discussions between the former prosecutor and Mr. Cosby or his then criminal counsel, let alone signatories to any agreement of any kind. We were not consulted or asked our thoughts by Mr. Castor concerning any agreements concerning immunity or anything, and we were not made aware if there were any such discussions. The press release had no meaning or significance to us in 2005 other than being a press release circulated by the then District Attorney.Once again, we remain grateful to those women who came forward to tell their stores, to DA Kevin Steele and the excellent prosecutors who achieved a conviction at trial, despite the ultimate outcome which resulted from a procedural technicality, and we urge all victims to have their voices heard. We do not intend to make any further comment.In the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s opinion, the judges “do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors ‘over whether charges should be brought in any given case,'” but rather the court examined if the prosecution performed within the bounds of due process.Legal experts say the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s opinion reveals parts of the Cosby prosecution were braced on a legal house of cards. Prosecutors who took the legendary comedian and actor to trial twice say the ruling is an unfortunate technicality.Cosby tweeted out a statement, maintaining his innocence and thanking supporters.“I have never changed my stance nor my story. I have always maintained my innocence. Thank you to all my fans, supporters and friends who stood by me through this ordeal. Special thanks to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for upholding the rule of law,” he tweeted.Cosby’s return to his Elkins Park home was unceremonious in many ways but did inspire those passionate for and against the comedian to visit the property.In a T-shirt ode to his Philadelphia high school, Central graduate Cosby returned from prison, yielding comment to his attorneys and representative.“He said they was ringing his cell, they was just knocking on the walls the inmates, they said ‘you’re free! Get up! Get up.’ And he was just so excited,” spokesperson Andrew Wyatt said.Nearly 60 women accused Cosby of sexual assault. Attorney Gloria Allred represented several of the women and says her heart breaks for them.Phylicia Rashad, who played Clair Huxtable on The Cosby Show, took to social media after hearing the news Cosby would be released.“FINALLY!!!! A terrible wrong is being righted — a miscarriage of justice is corrected,” Rashad tweeted.FINALLY!!!! A terrible wrong is being righted- a miscarriage of justice is corrected! — Phylicia Rashad (@PhyliciaRashad) June 30, 2021He was charged in late 2015, when a prosecutor armed with newly unsealed evidence — Cosby’s damaging deposition from her lawsuit — arrested him days before the 12-year statute of limitations expired.The trial judge had allowed just one other accuser to testify at Cosby’s first trial, when the jury deadlocked. However, he then allowed five other accusers to testify at the retrial about their experiences with Cosby in the 1980s.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that testimony tainted the trial, even though a lower appeals court had found it appropriate to show a signature pattern of drugging and molesting women.Cosby was the first celebrity tried and convicted in the #MeToo era, so the reversal could make prosecutors wary of calling other accusers in similar cases. The law on prior bad act testimony varies by state, though, and the ruling only holds sway in Pennsylvania.Prosecutors did not immediately say if they would appeal or seek to try Cosby for a third time.The justices voiced concern not just about sex assault cases, but what they saw as the judiciary’s increasing tendency to allow testimony that crosses the line into character attacks. The law allows the testimony only in limited cases, including to show a crime pattern so specific it serves to identify the perpetrator.In New York, the judge presiding over last year’s trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose case had sparked the explosion of the #MeToo movement in 2017, let four other accusers testify. Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. He is now facing separate charges in California.In Cosby’s case, one of his appellate lawyers said prosecutors put on vague evidence about the uncharged conduct, including Cosby’s own recollections in his deposition about giving women alcohol or quaaludes before sexual encounters.“The presumption of innocence just didn’t exist for him,” Jennifer Bonjean, the lawyer, argued to the court in December.In May, Cosby was denied paroled after refusing to participate in sex offender programs during his nearly three years in state prison. He has long said he would resist the treatment programs and refuse to acknowledge wrongdoing even if it means serving the full 10-year sentence.This is the first year he was eligible for parole under the three- to 10-year sentence handed down after his 2018 conviction.Cosby spokesperson Andrew Wyatt called the parole board decision “appalling.”Prosecutors said Cosby repeatedly used his fame and “family man” persona to manipulate young women, holding himself out as a mentor before betraying them.Cosby, a groundbreaking Black actor who grew up in public housing in Philadelphia, made a fortune estimated at $400 million during his 50 years in the entertainment industry. His trademark clean comedy and homespun wisdom fueled popular TV shows, books and standup acts.He fell from favor in his later years as he lectured the Black community about family values, but was attempting a comeback when he was arrested.“There was a built-in level of trust because of his status in the entertainment industry and because he held himself out as a public moralist,” Assistant District Attorney Adrienne Jappe, of suburban Montgomery County, argued to the justices.Cosby had invited Constand to an estate he owns in Pennsylvania the night she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her.Constand, a former professional basketball player who worked at his alma mater, went to police a year later. The other accusers knew Cosby through the entertainment industry and did not go to police.CBS3’s Joe Holden, Natasha Brown and Alexandria Hoff contributed to this report.Copyright 2021 by The Associated Press.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — James Franco and his co-defendants agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit alleging he intimidated students at an acting and film school he founded into gratuitous and exploitative sexual situations, court filings made public Wednesday showed. The two sides first reached a deal to settle the class-action suit in February, but it took several months to resolve details, and the dollar amount was not previously disclosed. “While Defendants continue to deny the allegations in the Complaint, they acknowledge that Plaintiffs have raised important issues; and all parties strongly believe that now is a critical time to focus on addressing the mistreatment of women in Hollywood,” the statement said. “All agree on the need to make sure that no one in the entertainment industry — regardless of sex, race, religion, disability, ethnicity, background, gender or sexual orientation — faces discrimination, harassment or prejudice of any kind.”It alleged that Franco “sought to create a pipeline of young women who were subjected to his personal and professional sexual exploitation in the name of education,” and that students were led to believe roles in Franco’s films would be available to those who went along.Franco’s production company Rabbit Bandini and his partners including Vince Jolivette and Jay Davis were also named as defendants.The settlement includes “non-economic” terms that have not been made public. It has been submitted to a Los Angeles judge for approval. Before filing the lawsuit, Tither-Kaplan aired her allegations of sexual misconduct against Franco along with other women in the Los Angeles Times after Franco won a Golden Globe Award for “The Disaster Artist” in early 2018, when the wave of the #MeToo movement was first sweeping across Hollywood.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been sexually abused, but often will if they come forward publicly.

"SpaceX launches second dedicated rideshare mission - SpaceNews
WASHINGTON — SpaceX launched 88 satellites on a Falcon 9 June 30 on the company’s second dedicated smallsat rideshare mission.The Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:31 p.m. Eastern, more than halfway into a nearly hourlong launch window because of weather. A launch attempt the day before was scrubbed .Deployment of the payload of 88 satellites started nearly 58 minutes after liftoff, once the upper stage performed a second burn of its engine to place it into a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of nearly 550 kilometers. The satellites, from a variety of government and commercial customers, were released over half an hour.The mission, named Transporter-2 by SpaceX, was the company’s second dedicated smallsat rideshare mission, . The earlier flight carried 143 satellites, but SpaceX said the total payload mass for Transporter-2 was greater than that of Transporter-1. The company did not disclose specific payload mass figures for either mission.SpaceX established its smallsat rideshare program nearly two years ago, offering low-cost launches on dedicated Falcon 9 missions like Transporter-2 as well as on launches of its Starlink satellites. It has attracted significant interest from both companies and government agencies.The Transporter-2 payload manifest featured synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites from three competing companies: Capella, Iceye and Umbra. HawkEye 360 and Kleos, two companies deploying constellations to perform radio-frequency tracking, each had satellites on this mission, as did PlanetIQ and Spire, which collect GPS radio occultation data for use in weather forecasting.The . Two Mandrake-2 satellites — originally intended to launch on Transporter-1 before being damaged in prelaunch processing — feature optical crosslinks and will be used to test technologies for future low Earth orbit military satellite. Two cubesats built by General Atomics will also test optical communications between satellites and with drones. SDA has a fifth payload on Loft Orbital’s YAM-3 satellite.NASA flew two smallsats on Transporter-2, including a pathfinder for a cubesat constellation called TROPICS, for Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats. TROPICS Pathfinder is identical to the six TROPICS satellites that Astra will launch on its Rocket 3 small launch vehicle in 2022 and will enable full testing of the satellite design in advance of the deployment of the constellation.Many of the customers worked with launch services providers such as D-Orbit, Exolaunch and Spaceflight. That included two Sherpa tugs from Spaceflight on this launch, one of which has electric propulsion from Apollo Fusion.Launch cadence and reusabilityTransporter-2 was SpaceX’s 20th Falcon 9 mission of the year, with six months yet to go. In only two years has SpaceX conducted more orbital launches: 21 in 2018 and 26 in 2020. The company is on track to shatter the record set last year, even with an anticipated slowdown of launches in July and August.A key factor in that high launch cadence is reusability. The Falcon 9 booster used for Transporter-2 was making its eighth flight, concluding with a landing at Cape Canaveral’s Landing Zone 1. Its first launch was exactly one year ago, when it launched a GPS 3 satellite, and was also used for launching Turksat 5A and five Starlink missions before Transporter-2. Other Falcon 9 boosters have flown up to 10 times.While SpaceX previously set a goal of 10 flights per booster, company officials have in recent months suggested those boosters could fly more than 10 times. “We’ve got boosters now that have flown 10 times, and some that are slated to fly 20 or possibly 30 times,” Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of SpaceX, said in a June 29 appearance at the Mobile World Congress.“With Falcon 9, we’ve achieved I think the most efficient reusability of any rocket to date,” he said, but added that SpaceX will take reusability “to another level” with its Starship vehicle. That vehicle, whose first orbital launch Musk now says will take place in the “next few months,” is intended to be reflown without any significant refurbishment, like an airliner.“The Holy Grail for rocketry is rapidly reusable reliable rockets,” he said.",https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/f9-transporter2-879x485.jpg,"Demonstration of a trapped-ion atomic clock in space - Nature.com

Such satellite systems use precise measurement of signal propagation times determined by atomic clocks, together with propagation speed, to calculate position. Although space atomic clocks with low instability are an enabling technology for global navigation, they have not yet been applied to deep space navigation and have seen only limited application to space-based fundamental physics, owing to performance constraints imposed by the rigours of space operation7. Methods of electromagnetically trapping and cooling ions have revolutionized atomic clock performance8,9,10,11,12,13. Terrestrial trapped-ion clocks operating in the optical domain have achieved orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance over their predecessors and have become a key component in national metrology laboratory research programmes13, but transporting this new technology into space has remained challenging. Here we show the results from a trapped-ion atomic clock operating in space. On the ground, NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock demonstrated a short-term fractional frequency stability of 1.5 × 10−13/τ1/2 (where τ is the averaging time)14. Launched in 2019, the clock has operated for more than 12 months in space and demonstrated there a long-term stability of 3 × 10−15 at 23 days (no drift removal), and an estimated drift of 3.0(0.7) × 10−16 per day. Each of these exceeds current space clock performance by up to an order of magnitude15,16,17. The Deep Space Atomic Clock is particularly amenable to the space environment because of its low sensitivity to variations in radiation, temperature and magnetic fields.

In what could be a considered a celestial version of ""Pac-Man,"" scientists have detected black holes gobbling up neutron stars — marking the observation of collisions between the two most extreme objects in the universe for the very first time.And the hefty feasts occurred one billion years ago.Within a 10-day time frame, a team of over 1,000 international scientists spotted the rare cosmic event twice using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory in the U.S. and the Virgo gravitational-wave observatory in Italy, They published their findings, originally documented in January 2020, on Tuesday in . While researchers have  in the past, this is the first time one has been confirmed. Ecstatic researchers say the observations of the death spiral and merger of neutron stars and black holes will help ""unlock some of the most complex mysteries of the universe,"" including the building blocks of matter and the nature of the space-time continuum.Co-author Susan Scott said that, although the collisions occurred about a billion years ago, they were so massive that their gravitational waves — ripples in space-time that shake the entire universe — have only just finished traveling at least 900 million light years to reach Earth. ""These collisions have shaken the universe to its core and we've detected the ripples they have sent hurtling through the cosmos,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. ""Each collision isn't just the coming together of two massive and dense objects. It's really like Pac-Man, with a black hole swallowing its companion neutron star whole.""  Ahead of the collision and merger, the two massive objects, both the corpses of massive dead stars, orbit each other at around half the speed of light. During the newly-captured collision, the neutron star is warped and deformed as it nears the black hole, which becomes more massive as it swallows the star whole. In one instance, a black hole with a mass nine times that of our sun swallowed up a neutron star with a mass around twice that of the sun. The other event involved a black hole with a mass about six times bigger than the sun snacking on a neutron star about 1.5 times the sun's mass. All of the mass of a neutron star is squeezed into an extremely dense star, which is about the size of a city. Scientists say that one teaspoon of a neutron star weighs as much as all of humanity.Astronomers searched the sky for flashes of light that may have resulted from the events, but none were found, possibly due to their distance from Earth. Additionally, the black holes in these cases were large enough to swallow the entirety of the neutron stars, leaving behind no light to detect. ""These were not events where the black holes munched on the neutron stars like the cookie monster and flung bits and pieces about,"" said co-author Patrick Brady. ""That 'flinging about' is what would produce light, and we don't think that happened in these cases.""Scientists have previously captured two black holes smashing together and the collision of two neutron stars — but they ""have waiting a very long time"" to witness the two come together. ""Now, we've completed the last piece of the puzzle with the first confirmed observations of gravitational waves from a black hole and a neutron star colliding,"" Scott said.Astronomers have spent decades hunting for this sort of event in the Milky Way galaxy, but have yet to find any. ""With this new discovery of neutron star-black hole mergers outside our galaxy, we have found the missing type of binary,"" co-author Astrid Lamberts said. ""We can finally begin to understand how many of these systems exist, how often they merge, and why we have not yet seen examples in the Milky Way."" ""These kind of detections are incredibly rare,"" said co-author Johannes Eichholz. ""We haven't detected these events once — but twice and within 10 days of each other. ""Like the ripples from these two events, which have been felt a billion years later, these findings will have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe for many years to come.""",https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/06/30/7ca9b173-724a-408c-b7d2-886e8c4024e3/thumbnail/620x349/194dddfe167ff92db99fa16ebe874dc6/nsbh-merger-graphic-2021-carl-knox-ozgrav-swinburne-web.jpg#
"Google adds support for virtual COVID-19 vaccine cards on Android devices - Engadget
Google has updated its Pay app's ""Passes API"" to enable a simple way to store and display a digital card on Android showing users' COVID-19 test and vaccination details. The tech giant has given healthcare organizations, government agencies, as well as organizations authorized by public health authorities to distribute COVID vaccines access to the API. That means their developers can now easily create digital COVID vaccine and test cards that users can store on their device. As 9to5Google notes, Passes is a Google Pay API used to store non-payment cards like retailer membership cards. However, there's no need for users to download the Pay app if they don't have it to be able to store the COVID digital cards created using the Passes API. Once they get the digital card, they'll be able to access it via a shortcut on their home screen even without an internet connection. That said, their devices must run Android 5 or later.In the interest of assuaging users' privacy fears, Google says it doesn't retain a copy of people's COVID-19 vaccine and test information. The company also says it doesn't share data on the card with third party services and that it doesn't use the information for ad targeting. Users can show the card to anybody they want, of course, though they'll be required to have a lock screen on their device before they can store the card for their own safety. The Passes API update is only available in the US at the moment, but the tech giant promises that it will also roll out to other countries in the future. ",https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KrjcPZT2jpJVh_OjAwLHbQ--~B/aD0xMDQwO3c9MTYwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/83903600-da2a-11eb-8ddf-e407024d76e3.cf.jpg,"All Android phones on AT&T to use Google Messages app and RCS - 9to5Google
Yesterday@technacityGoogle and AT&T announced today that the carrier would be using the Messages app and Rich Communicate Services (RCS) on all Android phones in the US. 
As reported by The Verge this morning, this follows T-Mobile back in March adopting RCS for a more “consistent messaging.”RCS is meant to replace SMS and surfaced to end users by Google as “Chat.” It makes possible features like typing indicators, read receipts, higher-resolution images/videos, and bigger group chats, as well as interactive business messaging with stores and airlines. RCS works over mobile data, and chats can be sent over Wi-Fi as a result.Google this month just rolled out end-to-end encryption for 1:1 conversations. Meanwhile, Google in recent weeks has been updating the Messages app quite frequently, and just rolled out the ability to star texts/photos/videos.

In the US market, Verizon is now the holdout in that it’s sticking to its own implementation of RCS — with a separate app) rather than opting for the more universal standard. Last November, Google finished a global rollout of its cross-compatible RCS implementation directly to Messages users since carriers were taking some time to implement it but otherwise deferred to local carriers. Meanwhile, Samsung last year also agreed to support Google’s RCS Chat.AT&T did not provide RCS rollout details today, but the carrier will presumably require all future devices to be preloaded with the Google Messages app. Editor-in-chief.

"Japanese official warns US of potential surprise attack on Hawaii — from Russia and China - Yahoo News
Russia and China are coordinating military exercises to threaten not only Taiwan but also Hawaii, according to a senior Japanese defense official who warned the United States to beware of a Pearl Harbor-style surprise attack.“We have to show the deterrence towards China, and not just China but also the Russians, because, as I told you, that they are doing their exercises together,” Japanese deputy Yasuhide Nakayama told the Hudson Institute this week.Taiwan’s vulnerability to an invasion from mainland China has become a preoccupation of Indo-Pacific strategists in recent months, as Chinese Communist forces escalate their military drills around the island. Nakayama, who was unusually frank about the need for democratic nations to ensure Taiwan’s survival, implied that Russia and China are working as allies preparing for a major conflict.“I think the Taiwanese are really concerned,” he said. “And also, they’re focusing on the two big countries collaborating and [presenting] a lot of threat towards Taiwan.""Chinese Communist officials regard Taiwan as a renegade province, one that they have claimed since coming to power in 1949 but never governed. Most countries recognize the regime in Beijing as the official Chinese government and do not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, although the U.S. has maintained a friendly relationship and provided weaponry to help Taiwanese authorities deter an invasion from the mainland.“We have to protect Taiwan as a democratic country,” Nakayama said before suggesting that world leaders may have erred during the Cold War by seeming to concede that Taiwan would eventually be reunited with mainland China. “Was it right? ... I don’t know.”China’s Foreign Ministry protested his description of Taiwan as a “country” and alleged that Tokyo is trying to portray China as a threat in order to justify its own military buildup.Nakayama emphasized throughout the talk that tensions in the Indo-Pacific have a direct bearing on American security, especially in light of coordination between China and Russia. He drove home the point by raising the specter of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which provoked the U.S. military intervention in the Second World War.“Seventy years ago, we attacked Pearl Harbor, but now the U.S. and Japan [are] very good allies, one of the best allies all over the world,” he said, noting that Russia is conducting naval drills in the Pacific this week. “I don't want to remind [us of the attack] 70 years ago, but we have to be careful of the exercising of the Russians. They are taking place [off] the western side of that, Honolulu, I mean, in Hawaii.”“Honolulu to Japan, this zone is becoming — [the] Chinese and the Russians come in this zone,” he said. “So, [for] the United States, the protection line is going to be backwards a little bit.”Washington Examiner VideosTags: News, Foreign Policy, National Security, China, Russia, Taiwan, HawaiiOriginal Author: Joel GehrkeOriginal Location: ",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xbLyMfeWk3RSpMDhvMXRFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQzMC4zMjQ2NzUzMjQ2NzUz/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mj_2v850Nc5dLBrwUoPr.A--~B/aD05NDA7dz0xNTQwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/washington_examiner_articles_265/54f994db8adeabda3b01f3b802aa5da8,"Putin: Russia could sink United Kingdom warship without triggering 'world war' - Yahoo News
Russian forces could sink a British warship without triggering a “world war,” according to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who predicted Moscow would prevail if shooting broke out.""You said the world teetered on the brink of a world war. No, of course not,” Putin said during an annual question-and-answer session moderated by state media. “Even if we had sunk that ship, it would still be difficult to imagine that this would have put the world on the brink of WWIII, since those who are doing this, they know that they cannot emerge victorious from this war.”Putin adopted that tone in an apparent effort to downplay fears of a conflict while maintaining an aggressive posture in a controversy over the United Kingdom’s deployment of a destroyer to the Black Sea. Russian officials claimed to have fired warning shots and even dropped bombs near the vessel, but the U.K. countered that Moscow was lying about an uneventful encounter.“I don’t think that we would have been happy, either, with this development, but at least we would know what we were fighting for — our territory and our future,” Putin said, acknowledging the Kremlin also doesn’t want a real war. ""We were not the ones who came to them from thousands of kilometers away. They came to our borders.”British officials sent the HMS Defender to the waters off the coast of Crimea as a show of support for Ukraine, which lost control of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 when Russian special forces invaded and annexed the territory. Putin touts a subsequent referendum as proof that the Crimean people voted to leave Ukraine, but U.S. and European officials reject that vote as an “illegal” fig leaf for an unprovoked war of conquest.“We believe the Russians were undertaking a gunnery exercise in the Black Sea and provided the maritime community with prior warning of their activity,” British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in a report to British lawmakers. ""No shots were directed at HMS Defender, and we do not recognize the claim that bombs were dropped in her path.”Putin’s government is trying to strike a tough pose as the United States and Ukraine co-host a major annual naval drill in the Black Sea. “Though dramatic this Russian sparring is par of the course,” British lawmaker Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defense committee, wrote on social media. “But this intimidation is as much about fueling a dis-information campaign … & getting us to talk about Putin than a genuine escalation in hostilities.”Russian officials published updates on submarine “combat training” in the Black Sea in response to the U.S. and European exercises. Putin, for his part, claimed that the HMS Defender was working in conjunction with the U.S. on a surveillance mission to test Russian responses.“It was comprehensive and was staged not only by the British but also by the Americans because the British warship ventured into our territorial waters in the afternoon while early in the morning, at 07:30, a U.S. strategic reconnaissance plane took off from a NATO airfield in Greece, from Crete, I believe,” he said. “It was obvious that the destroyer intruded in pursuit of military aims, trying to find out with the help of a reconnaissance plane what our armed forces' countermeasures to this sort of provocations might be. ... Possibly, I've blabbed out a secret, my apologies to the military.”The Western naval drills come on the heels of a major Russian military buildup that raised the specter of a new major invasion into Ukraine, which has been embroiled in a Russian-led conflict in eastern Ukraine since 2014.“Ukraine already has an eastern border they have to defend, and Russia has recently sent over 100,000 troops to that region, including equipment, which would indicate that they have designs to come back since they left the equipment there, and now they have to worry about their northern border as well,” Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, said during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on June 9.Putin, however, protested that Western officials should have been gratified by Russia’s drawdown. “But instead of reacting to this positively and saying: 'Good, we have seen your response to our anger,' what did they do? They showed up on our borders,” he complained.Washington Examiner VideosTags: News, Foreign Policy, National Security, Russia, Crimea, United KingdomOriginal Author: Joel GehrkeOriginal Location: ",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/S2KhCt_osQ8UnrLRi4SFFA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQzMC4zMjQ2NzUzMjQ2NzUz/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7t9fqeV7tDtuNZUrf_uN9Q--~B/aD05NDA7dz0xNTQwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/washington_examiner_articles_265/177bc4158d76a2e36101c73af40c9379,"China, Russia exploiting United Nations to push back against US interests, report says - Fox News
The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies issues an alarming report about Beijing’s expanding tentacles in international agencies; Eric Shawn has the Fox News exclusive.The U.S. has been tackling increasing Chinese influence at the U.N. for years, even as it pumps the most money into the institution's various bodies. The Trump administration defunded or pulled out of a number of agencies amid fears they were anti-American and did not advance U.S. interests.The administration pulled out of the  over its alleged pro-China bias in its handling of the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Human Rights Council over its controversial membership and alleged anti-Israel bias, and it also pulled money from the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) for anti-Israel bias. The Biden administration has moved to reverse those measures.Nikki Haley, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under then-President Donald Trump who pushed a tough line on China at Turtle Bay, wrote the foreword for the report and warned how other countries are frightened of the communist regime’s growing influence at the body.""Like Russia, Beijing uses its seat on the Security Council to block justified and moral measures,"" she writes. ""Equally concerning, China is quietly working to corrupt the United Nations from top to bottom. Beijing is pursuing control of virtually every UN agency. Its actions are malicious and often disastrous.""Haley pointed to institutions like the WHO and warns that while reform can sometimes be possible, sometimes those agencies are irredeemable.""The WHO’s struggles illustrate another sad reality: Many UN agencies are broken. The United States should try to fix them where possible. Yet we cannot fall into the trap of mistaking process for progress,"" she says. ""Some parts of the United Nations just cannot be salvaged. Sometimes we are better off leaving them behind.""The report outlines how China is pursuing a ""multi-pronged strategy"" that includes taking control of standards-making bodies and aggressively promoting the international infrastructure program known as the Belt and Road Initiative, which has been praised by a number of U.N. officials.The report notes how China has grown its influence and won a number of elections in order to dominate a third of U.N. specialized agencies, while picking up a slew of seats on tribunals, councils and other bodies within the U.N.Meanwhile, it accuses Russia of using the border to cover up its non-compliance with international agreements and shielding of Syria and Iran from accountability on bodies like the U.N. Security Council.The report calls on the U.S., including the State Department and Congress, to wage a reform battle agency-by-agency to reestablish a U.S.-led order.The FDD report points to a number of bodies where more U.S. participation and funding cannot save those agencies, including UNRWA, the Human Rights Council, the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon and the International Criminal Court.The report cites the COVID-19 pandemic and the WHO’s mishandling of it as proof that the U.S. must not wait before pushing back against malign influences from countries like  China and Russia at the U.N.""When China is able to take control of organizations, China wins, but America and our allies lose,"" FDD’s Richard Goldberg told Fox News. ""What will be the next COVID-19? What will be the next international organization that has been taken over by China or Russia or other US adversaries that will work against our interests and cost, perhaps, unfortunately, more American lives, more American treasure in the future.""Fox News' Ben Evansky and Eric Shawn contributed to this report.",https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/67b523a3-269d-4d87-aa35-e32c68e3af56/5dfbe4ed-9ca2-4c6f-8471-bf362dd350dd/1280x720/match/931/524/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1
