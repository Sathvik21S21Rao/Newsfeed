Manchester United are set to make Jadon Sancho the second most expensive English football of all time, and have already lined up a shirt number suitable for the title. United have agreed a deal in principle with Borussia Dortmund worth £72.9million, and Sancho will sign a five-year deal, with an option of a further 12 months.The agreement almost brings to a close a deal over a year in the making, with United first tracking the former Manchester City player midthrough the 2019-20 season.Sancho has reportedly asked for the famous No.7 shirt, made famous by the likes of club greats George Best, Bryan Robson, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.Edinson Cavani wore the shirt last season and will, therefore, be given a new number for the 2021-22 campaign.With Anthony Martial's future at the club uncertain, Cavani could end up taking his no9.

PARIS  -The spectator who sent cyclist Tony Martin and, consequently, a large part of the Tour de France peloton, crashing in the opening stage of the race, has been arrested, BFM television reported on Wednesday, citing police sources.BFM added that the spectator had been taken in custody in Brittany, the northwest French region where the Tour de France, the world's biggest cycling event, held its first four stages.On Saturday, Martin was sent tumbling when he rode straight into a cardboard sign being held out by a fan looking the other way at a television camera, creating chaos with 47 kilometres left of the stage.Another huge pile-up occurred in a nervy finale on narrow roads on Monday, leading the Tour de France riders to put their collective foot down one kilometre into the fourth stage on Tuesday - literally - bringing the race to a halt for about a minute in a silent protest for safer racing conditions after the crashes.This Wednesday's fifth stage is a 27.2-km individual time trial from Change to Laval, and all eyes will be on the overall contenders.(Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Benoit Van Overstraeten)",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"England sheds agonizing history by knocking out Germany - Yahoo Singapore News
Keep up to speed at a glance with the Top 10 daily storiesKeep up to speed at a glance with the Top 10 daily storiesLONDON (AP) — As the Wembley Stadium announcer roared the final score — “England 2, Germany 0"" — Gareth Southgate's vision was momentarily diverted from his victorious players to the big screen.Shown beaming from the VIP seats, reveling in England's passage to the European Championship quarterfinals on Tuesday, were David Beckham and Ed Sheeran. Prince William, wife Kate and 7-year-old Prince George were also there celebrating, as fans just like their subjects rather than royalty.But it was the sight of David Seaman that caught Southgate's eyes and made him pause, to think back — in one of his greatest moments as England coach — to the pain of 25 years ago. It was Southgate's penalty miss at the old Wembley that denied an England side with Seaman in goal the chance to reach the Euro ’96 final.“For the teammates who played with me, I can’t change that — so that's always going to hurt,"" Southgate said. “But what this group of players has been able to do is give a new generation a lot of happy memories and another afternoon where they have made a bit of history.”England is finally unburdened by the weight of its agonizing history against the Germans. This was a day more reminiscent, albeit with a long way to go in Euro 2020, of the 1966 World Cup final win over them on the same site.Not that it came easily. Just like in England’s two group wins, Raheem Sterling was on the scoresheet, breaking the tense deadlock in the 75th minute. But this time Harry Kane finally scored his first goal at Euro 2020, easing the pressure on the 2018 World Cup Golden Boot winner's shoulders.“With all the expectation and pressure, we delivered,” Kane said. ""It’s a moment none of us will ever forget. The perfect afternoon.”It was England’s second-ever win in the knockout stage of the European Championship. The last such triumph came on penalties against Spain at Euro ’96 before the hosts were denied a place in the final by Germany in that shootout.It was on penalties that Germany also beat England in the 1990 World Cup semifinals. Then there was the English goal wrongfully disallowed as Germany knocked the English out of the 2010 World Cup.Now England will play Ukraine in the Euro 2020 quarterfinals on Saturday in Rome, eying a return to Wembley for the semifinals and the final.It marked the end of the 15-year reign of Joachim Löw as the 2014 World Cup-winning coach takes time out to consider his next steps.“We were not clinical enough,"" he said. “The team needs to mature to be more successful.”There will still be questions about Southgate's team selection and persistence with Kane when he managed only one touch in the opposition penalty area in the first half. And it was a bad one, taking a ball too far past Manuel Neuer while trying to go around the goalkeeper.But while Sterling's goals are spearheading England's progress at this largely-home tournament, the saves of Jordan Pickford are proving vital, too, including using one hand to push over Kai Havertz's shot at the start of the second half.The clamor to introduce Jack Grealish was growing in the second half. It's what got fans chanting inside Wembley, with a crowd of about 40,000 the biggest in Britain since the pandemic began in March 2020.The winger finally entered with about 20 minutes to go and played a role in the opening goal.Sterling first took on the defenders, going past Antonio Rüdiger before passing to Kane, whose layoff to Grealish then went to Luke Shaw. And it was the left back's cross that Sterling connected with, shooting past Neuer with his right boot.“We knew the intensity we can play at,"" Sterling said, “and not many teams can deal with it.”For all the experience in Germany's side compared to the youth of England, it was World Cup winner Thomas Müller who squandered a chance to equalize in the 81st minute. Clean through with only Pickford to beat, Müller put the ball wide.Kane showed him how it's done, heading in a cross from Grealish in the 86th minute to get the 35th England goal that eluded him in the group stage.“When you’re a center forward it doesn’t matter what else you’re doing in the game,” Southgate said. “You need those goals.""England has yet to concede in its four games. Just like at the 1966 World Cup — and that ended well.“This,"" Kane said, “will give us more self-belief going forward.”___More AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Y_5Xm5nVngVwSD9_jlY8vw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/C967Hlsv4q8EYgHiM.9GaQ--~B/aD0yOTI0O3c9NDM4NjthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/39a08d3087e2437d16b06298d48febb9,"Spurs star Son left out of South Korea Olympic football squad - CNA

TOKYO: When Kohei Jinno was evicted from his family home to clear the way for the construction of the National Stadium for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, he was sad but proud to contribute to Japan in a moment of national triumph.But when he was evicted again in 2013, at age 80, so the government could rebuild the stadium for the 2020 Games, it felt like a bitter twist of fate made worse by what he saw as official indifference.It also forced him and his wife, Yasuko, out of a tight-knit public housing community in the Kasumigaoka neighbourhood where they had lived for over half a century.""It was so hard to leave,"" said Jinno, now 87. ""It was the place I'd lived the longest in my life.""

Jinno had not wanted the Olympics in Japan - thinking it too soon to host again - and said the announcement that roughly 200 families, many elderly, were being evicted from their housing complex in the shadow of the stadium came from nowhere.""There wasn't any consideration. If there'd only been one example of 'you're being asked to move, could you please possibly cooperate?'"" Jinno said. ""Instead, it was pretty much 'we're having the Olympics, you need to get out.'""They moved to another public housing complex, but the old community was shattered.""I would really have liked some understanding of how we felt,"" Jinno said. ""We got 170,000 yen (US$1,500). What can you do with that? I just had to laugh. It took 1 million yen (US$9,000) to move.""A Tokyo city official said 170,000 yen is standard payment in that situation.

""But to somebody who'd lived there a long time, officials probably did seem cold.""Tokyo 2020 Olympic organisers declined to comment, noting that the stadium is the responsibility of the Japan Sport Council (JSC) and the relocation was handled by the Tokyo government in accordance with their laws. The JSC said the relocation was done in consultation with the Tokyo and national governments.DEEP ROOTSJinno, the fourth of nine brothers, was born in Kasumigaoka, not far from what is now the posh Omotesando area in downtown Tokyo. After that house burned in World War Two, the family moved 20m away, where Jinno ran a tobacco shop attached to the family home.Ahead of the 1964 Olympics, they were evicted to make way for the stadium and a surrounding park. The site of their home was paved over, the greenery that blanketed the area cut down, and a nearby river buried in concrete.Jinno washed cars to make ends meet, living with Yasuko and their two children in one tiny room. But in 1965 he moved into the public housing complex and re-opened the tobacco shop.""I never ran out of people to talk to,"" he said. ""I put a bench out, three or four people could sit. Kids would come by with their homework, ask for advice if they got in trouble.""After their eviction notice in 2013, they moved in 2016.The move was hard, particularly on Yasuko, who Jinno said was ""lonely, depressed"". Late in 2018, at 84, she died.

"Singapore property market not overheated, but authorities watching prices closely: MAS - The Straits Times
SINGAPORE - The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said it would remain vigilant over rising home prices even though the property market was not ""overheated"".""No, we do not think the market is overheated right now, because if it is overheated, then we have not done our job well,"" MAS managing director Ravi Menon said in response to a question at a media briefing on the MAS Annual Report on Wednesday (June 30).Mr Menon said the property market had been remarkably resilient in the face of the pandemic and recession last year, and continued uncertainty over Covid-19 risks this year.While gross domestic product contracted in 2020, the residential property price index (PPI) rose by 1.6 per cent. As of the first quarter of 2021, the PPI was 5.6 per cent above its pre-pandemic levels, he said.The sharp recovery in Singapore's residential property market has sparked speculation that the Government may impose cooling measures for the first time since 2018.""The approach of the Government is to prevent the market from overheating. We're watching it very closely,"" said Mr Menon.He added: ""Authorities will never tell in advance whether they are going to implement measures, because that defeats the purpose of implementing the measures. So stay tuned and just watch, and we hope the market will continue to remain stable.""The MAS, together with the Ministry of National Development and Urban Redevelopment Authority, remains highly vigilant to the risk of a sustained increase in prices relative to income trends.Mr Menon said that ""a prolonged divergence between prices and incomes is unsustainable from a market stability perspective and undesirable from a housing affordability perspective"".He added that the MAS had repeatedly said it was determined to make sure the market remains stable and to prevent overheating from happening.",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/articles/2021/06/30/af_sghdbflats_3006.jpg?itok=EK_Dxy6F&timestamp=1625036906,"HDB resale prices up 2.8% in second quarter: Flash estimates - CNA
SINGAPORE: Resale prices in the public housing market rose 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2021, according to flash estimates released by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Thursday (Jul 1).The resale price index, which provides information on the general price movements in the resale public housing market, rose from 142.2 to 146.2, the HDB estimates showed.This comes after prices in the first quarter of 2021 climbed 3 per cent over that in the previous quarter.Construction delays of new Build-To-Order (BTO) flats drove many couples to look for housing in the secondary market, which explains the increase in resale prices, said OrangeTee & Tie's senior vice president of research and analytics Christine Sun.Buyers who are downsizing from private properties have also turned to the HDB resale market, she added. ""Due to the robust housing demand and supply shortage, bargains were fading, and buyers have to move quickly if they spot a home that interests them, especially for popular locations,"" said Ms Sun. ""With many eager buyers willing to match the valuation of properties, prices of resale flats are creeping up in many areas.""

Ms Sun added that the strong demand and home supply shortage may keep resale prices ""elevated"" in the coming months. ""The fast-rising prices may raise the barrier of entry for some first-time buyers. Those who cannot afford an HDB resale flat may either turn to the rental market or delay their wedding plans as they apply for BTO flats,"" said Ms Sun. Huttons Asia CEO Mark Yip said resale prices for flats in the central area, Serangoon and Woodlands saw the biggest increases. Resale prices in the central area rose 10.8 per cent, with 53 units sold, while prices in Serangoon increased 9.6 per cent with 112 units sold. Woodlands saw an 8.5 per cent rise in prices, with 393 units sold.Almost all towns saw lower transaction volumes in the second quarter of this year, except for Bukit Merah, Choa Chu Kang and Marine Parade. The lower volumes were due to restrictions imposed on viewings during Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), which started on May 16 and ended on Jun 13, said Mr Yip.""Generally there remain keen interest in the market for resale flats because of delays in completion of new homes,"" he said. ""We expect HDB resale prices to increase by 8 per cent to 10 per cent in 2021, surpassing the gains of 5 per cent in 2020,"" added Mr Yip. More detailed housing data will be released along with the final resale price index for the full quarter on Jul 23, said HDB.

SINGAPORE: The Bedok Point mall will make way for a residential development with commercial units on the ground floor, owner Frasers Property has confirmed.Frasers Property said in its financial results in May that it has been granted provisional permission by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) to redevelop the mall into a mixed-use development.""We are currently working with the relevant authorities on our plans and will share the details when our plans are ready,"" a Frasers Property spokesperson told CNA.The spokesperson did not give a reason for the redevelopment or a timeline for the project.""We are looking to create a sustainable, safe and adaptable environment that enjoys greater connectivity and accessibility,"" the spokesperson added.

Bedok Point mall tenants CNA spoke to said they were informed about the redevelopment plans earlier this year but have not been given a definitive timeline, although they suggested that it could happen early next year.The redevelopment was bound to happen as poor footfall at the mall means business has not been good, the tenants said.Bedok Point is further away from the MRT station and bus interchange than Bedok Mall, a bigger and more diverse shopping centre with residential units above, they added.""Existing tenants will be notified in advance on our redevelopment plans so that they are able to make their necessary business continuity plans,"" the Frasers Property spokesperson said.UNABLE TO BECOME DOMINANT MALL IN BEDOKThe redevelopment comes after Frasers Property bought Bedok Point from one of its real estate investment trusts, Frasers Centrepoint Trust (FCT).At FCT's extraordinary general meeting in September last year, shareholders questioned why Bedok Point was sold for S$108 million when it was bought in 2011 for S$129 million.






                                    

Bedok Mall is slightly closer than Bedok Point to Bedok MRT station and bus interchange.


In response, FCT's manager said Bedok Point was acquired in 2011 ""for a consideration of S$127 million"", adding that the mall's size constraint and the lack of direct connectivity to key transportation nodes ""limited its ability to be the dominant mall within Bedok town centre"".""Over the years, the manager has focused on proactive leasing and re-positioning strategies to stabilise its performance,"" the manager added, according to a copy of the meeting minutes obtained by CNA.""This was as competition intensified due to new competing retail offering which is larger and better located within its immediate catchment.""The manager highlighted that Bedok Point has achieved occupancy of above 90 per cent at the time, but ""remains challenged"" especially with the COVID-19 pandemic.TENANTS UNSURE OF FUTURE PLANSMr Jackson Lee, owner of optical and eyewear shop Trendy Eyes in Bedok Point, called the redevelopment plans an ""open secret"" as business has been ""very quiet"".While the 43-year-old said rental fees have been manageable, the lack of customers means he was ""not really getting much of a value"".""Bedok Point's location definitely loses to Bedok Mall, which is at the transport nodes,"" he said, conceding that Bedok Point is ""slightly out of the way"".""In terms of offerings, Bedok Point doesn't really have strong anchor tenants. The mall is not really doing much to attract people.""

When the redevelopment happens, Mr Lee said he has ""no choice but to search for an alternative place"". He plans to stay in the Bedok area where most of his regular customers are.""We checked Eastpoint Mall (in Simei) because it is also under Frasers Property, but the rental is a bit unfriendly,"" he said.Mr Lee hopes Frasers Property will let tenants know early once the plans are finalised. ""So far, they have been (quite quiet) about it,"" he added.

Ms Wendy Hsu, who runs Xiang Xiang Traditional Taiwanese Cuisine, believes tenants will be notified 30 days in advance of the final plans.Ms Hsu, who is in her 50s, said she plans to stay in Bedok Point until the end of the year when her lease expires, but has not thought about where she will go next.The restaurant only has one outlet in Singapore, and has been at Bedok Point for almost three years.While Ms Hsu acknowledged that Bedok Point's less accessible location makes it ""quiet"" compared to Bedok Mall, she said her restaurant managed to get good reviews from prominent food critics, leading to more customers.""The tenants in this mall keep changing; we are the ones who stayed here the longest. It's definitely not easy,"" she said.Ms Hsu said she does not feel sad that she might have to leave Bedok Point, noting that the writing was already on the wall after the mall was sold.""The journey is quite tough but we are also happy that we managed to so-called survive here and are doing quite okay,"" she said.She added that it remains to be seen whether the redevelopment will start early next year, pointing to how the pandemic has created a labour crunch in the construction industry.""I think most likely it will be delayed,"" she said.The manager of a shop on the fourth floor of Bedok Point said business has been ""not so good"" with rental fees being ""too high"".""I can move, but I need to finish my two-year contract first,"" said the 25-year-old, who requested that he and his shop not be identified. ""Once Bedok Point closes then I will think (about where to go).""REDEVELOPMENT COULD TAKE FOUR YEARSMs Pearl Lok, an analyst with real estate services company Colliers, told CNA that displaced tenants in Bedok Point could be offered spaces in other malls within Frasers Property's portfolio, with fresh negotiations between the tenants and the landlord.""Most typical tenancies could have redevelopment clauses that allow landlords to serve notice for these tenants to vacate the property (if) a redevelopment was to take place,"" said Ms Lok, who is director of capital markets and investment services at Colliers.""Alternatively, landlords may also allow the rental leases to expire before the redevelopment takes place.""Ms Lok said depending on the complexity, a typical redevelopment project could take three to four years, including demolition and construction.""The timeline may be deferred due to the current shortage of manpower and materials in the construction industry,"" she added.Elaborating on the possible reasons behind the redevelopment, Ms Lok said Bedok Point might not have the ""critical mass to attract a similar catchment"" as the newer and larger Bedok Mall.""Additionally, Bedok Point was not able to enjoy the convenience of direct access to the bus interchange and MRT station, where commuters transit and can pick up items before they move to the next location,"" she suggested.RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT MORE ATTRACTIVEMs Lok said a residential-commercial development could fare better as the mall sits in an ""attractive location in the heart of the action in Bedok"", near amenities like food centres, polyclinic, mall and main transport nodes.""It is most suitable for young families, as numerous primary schools are within a 1km radius from the site,"" she added.URA's master plan indicates that the site at 799 New Upper Changi Road, where Bedok Point is located, is to be used mainly for commercial development. It is unclear why a residential-commercial development was provisionally approved for the site.URA does not comment on provisional permissions, but uploads details of final written permissions on its website.Ms Lok said the next steps for Frasers Property would be to sort out any conditions set out in the provisional permission, before consulting relevant authorities to address any concerns, including topping up for a fresh 99-year lease. ""After which, developers would then submit for the grant of Written Permission and make the necessary payments to the authorities,"" she said.",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"170 members of The Pines club who sued tycoon win nominal amount - The New Paper
The plaintiffs had sought damages of more than $110,000 each, alleging deceit, negligence and negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract.High Court judge Chua Lee Ming yesterday found Mr Kwee's company Exklusiv Resorts liable only for breach of contract.The judge said Exklusiv had breached implied terms in the membership contract.Among other things, the terms implied that rules cannot be changed to allow the club to be situated outside the central area of Singapore.Justice Chua said he awarded nominal damages because the plaintiffs failed to prove that they had suffered any loss.The club is owned by Exklusiv Resorts, of which Mr Kwee is a director and indirect shareholder.From 2003 to 2012, the club suffered an estimated loss of $61 million due to low membership. It had only 1,490 members in 2012, short of Mr Kwee's target of 8,000.In June 2011, Exklusiv engaged architects to draw up plans for the redevelopment of the site.The proposal included two blocks of hotels and a four-storey clubhouse.In March 2013, Exklusiv confirmed with members its redevelopment plans after provisional permission was granted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).That month, it granted Oxley Holdings subsidiary Oxley Gem an option to purchase the site for $318 million. The option also provided that Exklusiv had the first right of refusal to lease from Oxley Gem the part of the development that comprised club facilities.In September 2013, Exklusiv told club members that the clubhouse would cease operations on Nov 1, 2013, and that the construction schedule would be extended.But by late 2015, it became apparent that it was impossible to build and operate the envisioned new clubhouse due to URA's gross floor area restrictions and insufficiency of parking spaces.In March 2016, Exklusiv amended the club's rules to allow it to relocate the club and clubhouse.Eventually, Exklusiv decided to relocate the club to Laguna National Golf and Country Club. Group Exklusiv, also owned by Mr Kwee, bought over Laguna in 2001.Members who were unhappy with the relocation filed a representative action against Mr Kwee and Exklusiv in 2019.They sought a declaration that the changes to the rules were invalid.Get The New Paper on your phone with the free TNP app. Download from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store now",https://www.tnp.sg/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/articles/2021/07/01/NP_20210701_SEPINES_6658563.jpg?itok=9T560LKh
"World passes three billion vaccine mark in race to contain C... - MENAFN.COM
(MENAFN  -  Gulf Times) More than three billion Covid-19 vaccines have been administered around the world, an AFP tally found Tuesday, as countries race to contain the virulent Delta variant that is fuelling outbreaks all over the globe.
The highly infectious strain of coronavirus has caught many nations off guard, with Russia reporting its highest daily death toll yet, Australia shutting down city after city and fears growing over major sporting events like Euro 2020 and the Olympic Games.
At least 3.9 million people have died from Covid-19, and while some wealthy countries are succeeding in bringing infections down thanks to strong vaccination drives, others where shots are not as readily available are struggling.

published :
													1 Jul 2021 at 17:37												writer: Though Gerry Casida is on the priority list for a free Covid-19 vaccine in the Philippines because of his asthma, he’s isn’t planning to get the shot any time soon. A video he found on social media of a woman claiming vaccines are being used for genocide helps explain why.""I’ve read a lot of posts on Facebook about how many died in other countries because of vaccines, and how that’s being concealed,"" said the construction worker, 43, from Manila. ""My mom also consulted a folk healer, who said the vaccines could affect my heart.""Millions of people like Casida in some of the worst Covid hotspots in Southeast Asia are delaying inoculation or just saying no, swayed by disinformation on social media from both local sources as well anti-vaccination movements in the US.Those false claims are fuelling vaccine hesitancy in some pockets of the region, undermining efforts to inoculate some of the most vulnerable people in Asia and end a pandemic that has stalled the global economy.Despite some of the highest rates of new cases in the world, recent surveys show vaccine resistance is prevalent in the region.In the Philippines, 68% of people are either uncertain or unwilling to take a Covid shot, according to polling company Social Weather Stations.A third of Thais have doubts or refuse to be vaccinated, according to the Suan Dusit Poll, while a separate survey in Indonesia showed nearly a fifth of the population were hesitant.Anti-vaccination propaganda is a big reason for that reluctance, which has further slowed takeup in countries already struggling with limited supplies. Less than 10% of the population in Thailand and the Philippines have received even one shot.""It is a polluted media landscape,"" Melissa Fleming, the United Nations’ under-secretary-general for global communications, said at a virtual forum in May. ""This infodemic has shifted now, and the focus is misinformation on vaccines. It’s about instilling fear in people.""A heavily Catholic country, the Philippines has been particularly vulnerable to falsehoods peddled online by US evangelical Christian groups, which then filter across through church and family networks.Among many Facebook discussion groups focused on anti-vaccination theories trawled by Bloomberg News, one video in the local Filipino language claimed Covid shots will brand people with the ""mark of the beast"", alluding to the Antichrist in Christian eschatology. It got more than a thousand views.An English-language video with hundreds of views said the vaccine makes recipients magnetic. In Malaysia, misinformation ranging from exaggerated risks to life and body organs to genetic alteration are spreading on the Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp.Many of them twist and amplify arguments made by US politicians and also Michael Yeadon, a former Pfizer scientist and a Covid-vaccine skeptic who’s become an icon for anti-vaxxers.Other popular conspiracy theories being peddled on social platforms across the region include a claim that microchips in Covid-19 vaccines are being used to collect biometric data.The resistance is challenging governments keen to get as much as 80% of their populations protected against the deadly pathogen.Almost all countries in Southeast Asia are struggling with a perfect storm: outbreaks driven by more transmissible variants; lagging inoculation because of shortages after rich nations dominated stock; and, global isolation.In  which tracks how well the world’s biggest 53 economies are handling the crisis, these countries are now in the bottom 10.""Without some semblance of herd resiliency to the coronavirus, large countries and small will have difficulty in accommodating the free flow of international travellers, which is important not only for the travel and hospitality industries, but for business and international investment,"" said Steve Cochrane, chief APAC economist at Moody’s Analytics.In February, Malaysia’s Science Minister Khairy Jamaluddin had to reassure the public about the safety of vaccines, saying they don’t contain microchips. He also rubbished claims that they are part of an Illuminati agenda to establish a new world order, according to a report by the Straits Times.Open letterEven in Singapore, which has largely contained the spread of the virus, the young and educated succumb to fake news, said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease physician at Singapore’s Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.""Some of the stories get amplified more, but the reasons are pretty much the same,"" he said.In late May, an open letter by a dozen Singapore doctors questioning the safety of mRNA vaccines, including a claim that the shots would change one’s DNA, was circulated on WhatsApp.That elicited a swift rebuke from the city-state’s health ministry, which issued a press release saying all but one of the medical professionals ""have since retracted their statement"".Despite efforts by governments and companies to curb unsubstantiated information, the false claims in English often continue to spread in non-English speaking communities.Encrypted platforms, where there’s less moderation, also play a key role, said Ishaana Aiyanna, a researcher at Logically, a technology company that tracks misinformation and targeted disinformation campaigns.""Western narratives that have previously been debunked are often circulated alongside hyper-localized narratives,"" she said. ""This is compounded by a lack of media literacy on the part of a vast majority who rely solely on these groups and online communities for information.""There’s another major reason for hesitancy. With wealthier Western nations getting the lion’s share of the super-effective mRNA shots, poorer countries are having to contend with limited supplies and fewer available brands, exacerbating the problem. When a country offers a choice of only one vaccine, many people want to wait until they can get a higher-efficacy shot.In Thailand, some are refusing vaccines from China’s Sinovac Biotech and the UK’s AstraZeneca.In the Philippines, nearly 50% in a survey earlier this year said they trust US-made shots the most, but the nation’s vaccine programme has relied primarily on Sinovac. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has threatened to jail those who refuse vaccines.Others are taking a quirkier approach to encourage vaccinations. A district in northern Thailand started raffling off cows in mid-June as an incentive. In rural Indonesia, vaccinated residents got free chickens, while a city in the Philippines is giving away a house.Educating vaccine recipients and even medical practitioners is the best tool for fighting hesitancy, said Leong.""The biggest weapon the Covid-19 virus has against humans is one, vaccine hesitancy, and two, the lack of a coordinated worldwide response,"" he said. ""And in these two, human beings have failed miserably and the virus is winning incredibly.""Myanmar extended a series of measures by one month to fight Covid-19, as the country reported 1,580 new infections on Wednesday, the highest one-day tally in seven months, according to the Central Committee on Covid-19 Control.Though Gerry Casida is on the priority list for a free Covid-19 vaccine in the Philippines because of his asthma, he’s isn’t planning to get the shot any time soon. A video he found on social media of a woman claiming vaccines are being used for genocide helps explain why.Following the closure of construction sites this week, 32 provinces have reported travellers infected with Covid-19 arriving home from Bangkok.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20210701/c1_2141767.jpg,"Eisai Launches In-house Developed Anti-insomnia Drug Dayvigo (Lemborexant) In Hong Kong - Yahoo Finance Australia
TOKYO, Jul 1, 2021 - (JCN Newswire) - Eisai Co., Ltd. announced today that its Hong Kong subsidiary Eisai (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd. has launched the in-house-discovered and developed orexin receptor antagonist DAYVIGO (generic name: lemborexant) for the treatment of adults with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Eisai received approval for DAYVIGO in Hong Kong on February 28, 2021, and this launch is the first for DAYVIGO in Asia outside of Japan. DAYVIGO is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that inhibits orexin neurotransmission regulating sleep-wake rhythm by binding competitively to the two subtypes of orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R). DAYVIGO acts on the orexin neurotransmitter system and is believed to facilitate sleep onset, sleep maintenance, and wake by regulating sleep-wake rhythm.DAYVIGO binds to orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R and acts as a competitive antagonist with stronger inhibition effect on OX2R, which suppresses both REM and non-REM sleep drive, such that DAYVIGO may provide faster sleep onset and better sleep maintenance to patients.DAYVIGO was launched in the U.S. and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance; and in Japan for the treatment of insomnia. In addition, applications for approval have been submitted to the respective regulatory authorities in Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, and Eisai plans to further expand submissions of applications for approval in other countries. Insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or both, despite an adequate opportunity to sleep, that can lead to daytime consequences, such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating and irritability.1,2 Insomnia is one of the most common sleep-wake disorders. It is estimated that approximately 30% of adults worldwide have symptoms of insomnia.3,4 In Hong Kong, over 35% of adults are reported to have symptoms of insomnia.5 In particular, older adults also have a higher prevalence rate with many experiencing insomnia symptoms for months to years. As a result, insomnia causes various social losses, such as long absences and reduced productivity. It can increase the risk of falls in older adults. 6 Eisai will continue its efforts to deliver DAYVIGO as a new treatment option to insomnia patients across the world with the hope of contributing to restoration of daytime function and recovery for patients with insomnia by potentially delivering an active daytime life through fast sleep onset and good quality sleep.About DAYVIGO (Generic Name: Lemborexant)DAYVIGO, an orexin receptor antagonist, is Eisai's in-house discovered and developed small molecule that inhibits orexin neurotransmission by binding competitively to the two subtypes of orexin receptors (orexin receptor 1 and 2). Fast on/off receptor kinetics of DAYVIGO to orexin receptors may influence DAYVIGO's potential to facilitate improvements in sleep onset and maintenance with minimal morning residual effects.About Sleep-Wake Disorders and InsomniaSleep-wake disorders consist of disease categories such as insomnia, Irregular Sleep Wake Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD), hypersomnia and breathing-related sleep disorders. Among the sleep-wake disorders, insomnia is the most common with persistent insomnia symptoms experienced by approximately 30% of the adult population worldwide.(3),(4) Insomnia disorder is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep or both, despite an adequate opportunity to sleep, which can lead to daytime consequences, such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating and irritability.(1),(2)Sleeping well is essential for good health, including brain health.(7) Studies suggest an optimal sleep duration between seven and eight hours.(8) Poor sleep is associated with a wide range of health consequences, including an increased risk of hypertension, accidental injury, diabetes, obesity, depression, heart attack, stroke, dementia and adverse effects on mood and behavior.(1),(8)Women are 1.4 times more likely than men to suffer from insomnia.(9) Older adults also have higher prevalence of insomnia as aging is often accompanied by changes in sleep patterns, including disrupted sleep, frequent waking, and early waking, that can lead to less sleep time.(10)About the Anti-Insomnia Drug Market in Hong KongThe anti-insomnia drug market in Hong Kong as of 2020 valued at approximately 8.4 million USD, comprising nearly 9% of the insomnia drug market in Asia (Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand).(11) (1) Ferrie JE, et al.

LONDON: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine showed promise against the Delta variant first identified in India in a lab study, with a modest decrease in response compared to the original strain, the drugmaker said on Tuesday.The study was conducted on blood serum from eight participants obtained one week after they received the second dose of the vaccine, mRNA-1273.The vaccine provoked an antibody response against all the variants tested, according to Moderna, but one that remained inferior in all cases to the vaccine's neutralizing activity against the original coronavirus strain first found in China.The vaccine was far more effective in producing antibodies against the Delta variant than it was against the Beta variant first identified in South Africa, the data showed.




Against three versions of the Beta variant, the vaccine-elicited neutralizing antibodies reduced six-to-eight fold compared to those produced against original strain, while modest 3.2 to 2.1 fold reductions were seen for lineages of the variant first identified in India including Delta and Kappa.""These new data are encouraging and reinforce our belief that the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine should remain protective against newly detected variants,"" Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said.Earlier in the day, India granted permission to drugmaker Cipla to import Moderna's vaccine to the country for restricted use.The drugmaker's shares were up 5.5 per cent at $235.39 in mid-day trading.Moderna has submitted the data as a preprint to the website bioRxiv ahead of peer review.",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2
"Case closed: 'Cheek fillers' legal fight between Fann Wong and aesthetics doctor Siew Tuck Wah ends - AsiaOne
When Fann Wong appeared on Star Awards 2021 in April with pronounced cheeks, a local aesthetic doctor, Dr Siew Tuck Wah, wrote an opinion piece about it.He then received a letter of demand from a lawyer representing the actress' management.In a Facebook post on June 25, he provided an update to the issue and claimed that the case wasn't over (as of then).Didn't follow the whole brouhaha? Here's what happened.[embed]https://www.facebook.com/DrSiewTuckWah/posts/4245520482176207[/embed]According to Dr Siew, he published the opinion piece because his patients noticed that Fann's cheeks ""appeared unusually puffy"" and a couple of them cancelled their filler appointments ""for fear of becoming 'overfilled'"".Then on May 14, he received a 25-page Letter of Demand from Samuel Seow from Robert Wang and Woo LLP, a lawyer appointed by Fann's management company, in response to his article.Dr Siew said: ""The letter arrived at 4pm. However, as I was busy in the clinic, I could only review the letter at 5pm. The letter demanded that I take down my article on Fann Wong, and any social media posts related to Fann Wong and their unspecified clients, and issue a public apology immediately. I was only given one hour to respond.""Samuel Seow had repeatedly called my clinic staff to demand for immediate action. The tight timelines did not allow me to seek legal advice and to respond appropriately. Out of an abundance of caution, I had decided to take the article offline first and seek legal advice as I had done nothing wrong. Samuel Seow had also made allegations against me to my staff.""[[nid:534364]]Since the opinion piece has been unpublished, the exact nature of its contents is unclear. However, Mothership wrote that it ""did not paint Fann in an entirely good light"" and, in a subsequent article, described it as ""not entirely flattering"" but ""not entirely bad"".Dr Siew didn't publish the legal letter in full but pointed out that it ""threatened"" to ""sue for damages in defamation for alleging that Fann Wong had fillers done"" and ""sue for the alleged unauthorised use of one of Fann Wong's pictures from her Instagram account"".He said he responded via his lawyers on May 21, May 24, and June 3, sending letters to the same email address stated on the letter of demand, but did not receive a reply. Thus, Dr Siew thought the matter had been resolved. Until, he claimed, Seow sent a WhatsApp message to his staff on June 24 alleging that they didn't receive any letters.When contacted by Coconuts over Dr Siew's claims, the lawyer representing Fann told the digital site that her team was no longer pursuing the matter and that they didn't receive a response from Dr Siew or his legal team.Marissa Tan from Robert Wang & Woo LLP said: ""After we sent the letter, I think they managed to take [the article] down so there was nothing else that we had to do, since our client's objective was achieved. So I sent the letter out but I did not receive any letters from the other solicitor.""Tan claimed that Dr Siew's letters were sent to another lawyer named Samuel Seow — the one repeatedly mentioned in Dr Siew's Facebook posts — even though she was the one who sent the first letter of demand, using her email.She added: ""As far as Fann is concerned, I think the matter has been settled, because the article has been taken down but it just has to end somewhere and I don't know where Dr Siew intends to be taking this whole thing but at some point of time, this must stop.""Just when you thought that things have been clarified, Dr Siew responded with a Facebook post yesterday (June 30) claiming that Samuel Seow was indeed the writer of the letter of demand and his email address was provided as well.He also said that he doesn't know who Tan is.[embed]https://www.facebook.com/DrSiewTuckWah/posts/4259205367474385[/embed]Well, guess this mystery just got a lot deeper with probably the same amount of twists and turns as Marvel Studios' Loki.But unlike that six-part series, we might never get an answer to what really happened to the letters of demand and who exactly wrote it.In any case, it seems that this legal fight between Fann and Dr Siew has come to a close.For now.ALSO READ: bryanlim@asiaone.com",https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_image/public/original_images/Jun2021/fannwong-stw_IG.jpg?itok=zL2hQZTH,"Bill Cosby home from prison after court reverses sexual assault conviction - CNA
NEW YORK: Bill Cosby was freed from prison and returned home on Wednesday (Jun 30), less than two hours after Pennsylvania's highest court overturned his sexual assault conviction, saying he never should have faced charges after striking a non-prosecution deal with a previous district attorney more than 15 years ago.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued its split decision after Cosby had served more than two years of a three- to 10-year sentence following his 2018 conviction, prompting outrage from sexual assault victims and their advocates.The 83-year-old actor and comedian was released from a state prison in Pennsylvania just before 2.30pm a corrections department spokesperson said.Around an hour later, he arrived at his stately stone mansion in Elkins Park, a Philadelphia suburb, before making a brief appearance alongside his lawyers in front of a gaggle of cameras late in the afternoon.A frail looking Cosby smiled and nodded when asked if he was happy to be home but did not speak as reporters shouted questions.""What we saw today was justice - justice for all Americans,"" his spokesperson, Andrew Wyatt, said. ""Mr Cosby's conviction being overturned is for the world and all Americans who have been treated unfairly by the judicial system.""Cosby is best known for his role as the lovable husband and father in the 1980s television comedy series The Cosby Show, earning him the nickname America's Dad.But his family-friendly reputation was shattered after dozens of women accused him of multiple sexual assaults over nearly five decades. His conviction was seen as a watershed moment in the #MeToo movement that brought forth an array of allegations against powerful men in Hollywood and beyond.Cosby was found guilty of drugging and molesting Andrea Constand, an employee at his alma mater Temple University, in his home in 2004. Constand's allegations were the only ones against Cosby that were not too old to allow for criminal charges.The court's decision expressly barred prosecutors from retrying Cosby.In a statement, Constand and her attorneys said they were not only disappointed in the ruling but concerned it could dissuade other victims from seeking justice.""Once again, we remain grateful to those women who came forward to tell their stories,"" they said.Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele, who charged Cosby in 2015, noted a jury found Cosby guilty and that Wednesday's decision was not based on the facts of the case.""My hope is that this decision will not dampen the reporting of sexual assaults by victims,"" he said in a statement. ""We still believe that no one is above the law - including those who are rich, famous and powerful.""Reaction was swift, with many women involved in the #MeToo movement expressing horror at the decision.""THIS is why women do not come forward,"" writer E Jean Carroll, who has accused former President Donald Trump of raping her in the 1990s, wrote on Twitter. Trump has denied her claim.But Phylicia Rashad, Cosby's co-star on The Cosby Show, celebrated the ruling for correcting ""a miscarriage of justice"".'ONLY ONE REMEDY'The court's majority found that a state prosecutor, Bruce Castor, made a deal with Cosby's attorneys in 2005 not to bring criminal charges after concluding he could not win a conviction.As a result, Cosby was unable to avoid testifying as part of a civil lawsuit that Constand brought against him, since defendants can only refuse to testify when faced with criminal prosecution.In a sworn deposition, Cosby acknowledged giving women sedatives to facilitate sexual encounters, though he maintained they were consensual. He eventually paid Constand a multimillion-dollar settlement.His admission, which a judge later unsealed in 2015, helped form the basis for criminal charges later that year. Steele, who had just defeated Castor in the election for district attorney in part by criticising him for failing to prosecute Cosby, charged Cosby days before the statute of limitations was set to expire.

Steele's prosecution, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court found, essentially amounted to reneging on Castor's earlier promise not to charge Cosby, violating his due process rights.""There is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante,"" Justice David Wecht wrote for a four-judge majority. ""He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be barred.""One dissenting justice said Cosby should stay in prison, while two others said prosecutors should be allowed to retry him without relying on the tainted evidence.Castor made national headlines in February as a member of former President Donald Trump's legal defence team during Trump's impeachment trial in the US Senate. The former prosecutor delivered a rambling opening statement that was widely panned by senators, including Republicans.In an interview, Castor said his deal with Cosby was the only way to ensure he would pay some sort of penalty via a civil lawsuit.""I feel I made the right decision in 2005, and I still do,"" he said.Cosby's first trial ended with a hung jury in 2017, when jurors could not reach a unanimous decision on his culpability. But he was found guilty at a second trial, after the judge, Steven O'Neill, allowed prosecutors to call five prior accusers - four more than in the first trial.Armed with those witnesses, prosecutors argued that Cosby's assault of Constand was a well-rehearsed offence he had honed over decades: he befriended younger women, acting as a mentor, only to sexually assault them, often with the help of drugs. ",https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/photo/81478822.cms,"J-pop singer Hikaru Utada comes out as non-binary - The Straits Times

SpaceX launched 85 satellites for external customers, as well as three Starlink satellites, to orbit on Tuesday, marking the second successful launch of the company's dedicated rideshare missions. While the Transporter-2 mission will deliver fewer objects to space than the first rideshare mission (the Transporter-1 sent up 143 satellites, a new record), it launched more mass to orbit overall.The Transporter launches are part of the company’s rideshare business model. Announced in 2019, these missions split up the rocket’s payload capacity among multiple customers, resulting in lower costs for each – many of whom are smaller companies that may find the expenses associated with getting to orbit otherwise impossible to pay. SpaceX still ends up with a full launch and the revenue to operate it.The Falcon 9 rocket took off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at around 3:31 PM Eastern time. It’s the 20th Falcon 9 launch in 2021 and the first launch this year that featured the first stage returning to land onshore, rather than on a drone ship at sea. The first stage booster separated at around 3:34 PM ET and returned to Cape Canaveral and successfully landed around eight minutes after liftoff. This was its eighth flight.Image Credits: The mission includes nearly 10 customers, some of whom are launch service providers who are themselves organizing customer payloads – like Spaceflight Inc., which is launching 36 small satellites on behalf of 14 customers, as well as its electric propulsion vehicle dubbed Sherpa-LTE. It also includes the first satellite launch for space intelligence company Umbra and Loft Orbital’s “rideshare” satellites, YAM-2 and YAM-3, each of which are equipped with five independent sensors for separate customers.As this was SpaceX’s 20th launch this year (and 127th mission to date), it’s pretty safe to assume that the company will far surpass last year’s record of 26 launches.This was the second attempt of the Transporter-2 launch, which was originally scheduled for June 29. That launch was halted at T-11 seconds after a rotary aircraft entered the flight zone. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk called the regulatory system broken in response.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Ancient Skull Discovered in China Represents New Human Species, Scientists Say - Caixin Global
Chinese scientists announced Friday that a fossilized skull dating back more than 146,000 years represents a new human species, shedding new light on mankind’s origins and evolution.An international research team led by Ji Qiang, a professor at Hebei GEO University (HGU), made the announcement in a paper, which was published in peer-reviewed scientific journal The Innovation. The skull was reportedly discovered in 1933 in Harbin, Northeast China’s Heilongjiang province, the paper said. The discovery has drawn much attention from experts. The new species is “closely related to Homo sapiens, laying a foundation for future study on the origin of Homo sapiens (our species),” Ji said.“This is a remarkable new piece in the jigsaw of human evolution, a fossil that will continue to add important information for many years to come. It is one of the best preserved of all ancient human fossils,” London’s Natural History Museum said in a report, citing human evolution expert Chris Stringer.Local media reported that the skull, which is 23 centimeters (cm) long and more than 15 cm wide, was originally found in 1933 during construction work for a bridge over the Songhua River in Harbin. HGU received the skull in 2018. Using geochemical techniques, Ji and his team ascertained that the skull was at least 146,000 years old, but no older than 309,000 years. It has large cranial capacity of 1,420 milliliters which puts it in the category of modern humans, the paper said. Researchers believe that the skull belongs to a male, about 50 years old, who lived on a forest-covered alluvial plain with a small group of people, Shanghai-based publication The Paper reported. Analyses showed that the skull belongs to an evolutionary branch different from other ancient human fossils found in China, such as Dali and Xiahe, forming a third East Asian lineage, the paper said. It is likely to be a new sister lineage of Homo sapiens and share the same ancestor with Homo, the research team wrote. The new species has been named Homo longi, or “Dragon Man,” after Heilongjiang province — or “black dragon river” province in English — where the skull was discovered.Ji previously wrote in the Journal of Geology that the well-preserved skull fossil provided critical evidence for understanding the evolution of humans and the origin of our species.Contact reporter Wang Xintong (xintongwang@caixin.com) and editor Lu Zhenhua (zhenhualu@caixin.com)Download our app to receive breaking news alerts and read the news on the go.Get our weekly free Must-Read newsletter.Products & ServicesAbout UsTerms of UseMedia PartnersCopyright © 2019 Caixin Global Limited.

  There are certain rules that even the most extreme objects in the universe must obey. A central law for black holes predicts that the area of their event horizons — the boundary beyond which nothing can ever escape — should never shrink. This law is Hawking’s area theorem, named after physicist Stephen Hawking, who derived the theorem in 1971.Fifty years later, physicists at MIT and elsewhere have now confirmed Hawking’s area theorem for the first time, using observations of gravitational waves. Their results appear today in Physical Review Letters.In the study, the researchers take a closer look at GW150914, the first gravitational wave signal detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), in 2015. The signal was a product of two inspiraling black holes that generated a new black hole, along with a huge amount of energy that rippled across space-time as gravitational waves.If Hawking’s area theorem holds, then the horizon area of the new black hole should not be smaller than the total horizon area of its parent black holes. In the new study, the physicists reanalyzed the signal from GW150914 before and after the cosmic collision and found that indeed, the total event horizon area did not decrease after the merger — a result that they report with 95 percent confidence.Their findings mark the first direct observational confirmation of Hawking’s area theorem, which has been proven mathematically but never observed in nature until now. The team plans to test future gravitational-wave signals to see if they might further confirm Hawking’s theorem or be a sign of new, law-bending physics.“It is possible that there’s a zoo of different compact objects, and while some of them are the black holes that follow Einstein and Hawking’s laws, others may be slightly different beasts,” says lead author Maximiliano Isi, a NASA Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow in MIT’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research. “So, it’s not like you do this test once and it’s over. You do this once, and it’s the beginning.”Isi’s co-authors on the paper are Will Farr of Stony Brook University and the Flatiron Institute’s Center for Computational Astrophysics, Matthew Giesler of Cornell University, Mark Scheel of Caltech, and Saul Teukolsky of Cornell University and Caltech.An age of insightsIn 1971, Stephen Hawking proposed the area theorem, which set off a series of fundamental insights about black hole mechanics. The theorem predicts that the total area of a black hole’s event horizon — and all black holes in the universe, for that matter — should never decrease. The statement was a curious parallel of the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy, or degree of disorder within an object, should also never decrease.The similarity between the two theories suggested that black holes could behave as thermal, heat-emitting objects — a confounding proposition, as black holes by their very nature were thought to never let energy escape, or radiate. Hawking eventually squared the two ideas in 1974, showing that black holes could have entropy and emit radiation over very long timescales if their quantum effects were taken into account. This phenomenon was dubbed “Hawking radiation” and remains one of the most fundamental revelations about black holes.“It all started with Hawking’s realization that the total horizon area in black holes can never go down,” Isi says. “The area law encapsulates a golden age in the ’70s where all these insights were being produced.”Hawking and others have since shown that the area theorem works out mathematically, but there had been no way to check it against nature until LIGO’s .Hawking, on hearing of the result, quickly contacted LIGO co-founder Kip Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech. His question: Could the detection confirm the area theorem?At the time, researchers did not have the ability to pick out the necessary information within the signal, before and after the merger, to determine whether the final horizon area did not decrease, as Hawking’s theorem would assume. It wasn’t until several years later, and the development of a technique by Isi and his colleagues, when testing the area law became feasible.Before and afterIn 2019, Isi and his colleagues developed a technique to  immediately following GW150914’s peak — the moment when the two parent black holes collided to form a new black hole. The team used the technique to pick out specific frequencies, or tones of the otherwise noisy aftermath, that they could use to calculate the final black hole’s mass and spin.A black hole’s mass and spin are directly related to the area of its event horizon, and Thorne, recalling Hawking’s query, approached them with a follow-up: Could they use the same technique to compare the signal before and after the merger, and confirm the area theorem?The researchers took on the challenge, and again split the GW150914 signal at its peak. They developed a model to analyze the signal before the peak, corresponding to the two inspiraling black holes, and to identify the mass and spin of both black holes before they merged. From these estimates, they calculated their total horizon areas — an estimate roughly equal to about 235,000 square kilometers, or roughly nine times the area of Massachusetts.They then used their previous technique to extract the “ringdown,” or reverberations of the newly formed black hole, from which they calculated its mass and spin, and ultimately its horizon area, which they found was equivalent to 367,000 square kilometers (approximately 13 times the Bay State’s area).“The data show with overwhelming confidence that the horizon area increased after the merger, and that the area law is satisfied with very high probability,” Isi says. “It was a relief that our result does agree with the paradigm that we expect, and does confirm our understanding of these complicated black hole mergers.”The team plans to further test Hawking’s area theorem, and other longstanding theories of black hole mechanics, using data from LIGO and Virgo, its counterpart in Italy.“It’s encouraging that we can think in new, creative ways about gravitational-wave data, and reach questions we thought we couldn’t before,” Isi says. “We can keep teasing out pieces of information that speak directly to the pillars of what we think we understand. One day, this data may reveal something we didn’t expect.”This research was supported, in part, by NASA, the Simons Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, USA",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Free divers’ heart rates can drop as low as 11 beats per minute - Livescience.com
The world's best free divers can survive brain oxygen levels lower than those found in seals, according to a new study.Free divers, or those that dive without breathing gear, can hold their breath for more than 4 minutes and descend to ocean depths of more than 328 feet (100 meters). But this endurance feat takes a toll on the body's ability to pump oxygen through the blood and to the brain. And if not enough oxygen goes to the brain, free divers are at risk of losing consciousness.""Before now, understanding the effects on these exceptional divers' brains and cardiovascular systems during such deep dives, and just how far these humans push their bodies, was not possible, as all research was done during simulated dives in the lab,"" senior author Erika Schagatay, a professor of animal physiology at Mid Sweden University, said in a statement. Related: ""The diver can reach a point where hypoxic (low-oxygen) blackout occurs, and the diver then needs to be rescued,"" Schagatay said. ""One of the main aims of the research is to warn the diver and safety personnel of an imminent blackout.""To understand how this extreme feat affects the human body, Schagatay and her team — along with researchers from the University of St Andrews in Scotland, Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania and the University of Tokyo — adapted a biomedical device, previously developed by the Dutch company Artinis Medical Systems, to withstand extreme ocean pressures.The biomedical device, which is typically used to measure brain function, fires two different wavelengths of light from LEDs onto the divers' foreheads to measure heart rate and oxygen levels in the blood and in the brain, . The device worked at depths of at least 351 feet (107 m), according to the statement. The researchers found that the free divers who reached those depths had brain oxygen levels that dropped to levels lower than those found in seals; some dropped as low as 25%. That's ""equivalent to some of the lowest values measured at the top of Mount Everest,"" Chris McKnight, a research fellow at the University of St Andrews' Sea Mammal Research Unit, said in the statement. Brain oxygen levels are typically around 98%, and if they drop below 50%, a person is almost certain to lose consciousness, according to the statement. They also found that divers' heart rates dipped as low as 11 beats per minute, McKnight said. As divers descend, their heart rates begin to decrease to help preserve blood-oxygen levels, according to the video.— — — The divers' heart rates were as low as those of diving seals, whales and dolphins, according to the statement. These marine creatures are some of the world's best athletes; for instance, elephant seals can hold their breath for 2 hours underwater to hunt for food, .""Beyond the exceptional physiological responses that free divers display and the extremes they can tolerate, they may be a very informative physiological group,"" McKnight said. ""Their physiological reactions are so unique and the conditions they're exposed to are not easily replicated, so they offer a unique way of understanding how the body responds to low blood oxygen, low brain oxygenation and severe cardiovascular suppression.""The findings can thus also inform researchers on how to protect the hearts and brains of patients who undergo surgical procedures or experience cardiac events, according to the statement.The findings were published June 28 in the journal .Originally published on Live Science.Stay up to date on the latest science news by signing up for our Essentials newsletter.Thank you for signing up to Live Science.

"Unofficial Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 renders leaks show off the foldable in full - TechRadar
While we wait for the official unveiling, we've seen plenty of leaked images of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 already – and the latest batch to arrive show off the foldable phone from just about every angle, and in a variety of colors too. There's even a video.These particular renders come courtesy of well-known tipster @OnLeaks and Digit India. We can see the black, silver and dark green colors that have previously been leaked, as well as the triple-lens camera on the back and the buttons and ports around the sides.According to these sources, the phone is going to come with a 7.5-inch AMOLED, 120Hz refresh-rate screen as its main display, and a 6.2-inch AMOLED panel on the outside that's used when the phone is folded shut. The main display uses a selfie camera embedded under the screen, while the secondary one has a more conventional punch hole camera.The dimensions are said to be 158.1 x 64.8 x 14.5mm (6.22 x 2.55 x 0.57 inches) when folded, and 158.1 x 128.1 x 6.6mm (6.22 x 5.04 x 0.26 inches) when unfolded, so a little smaller than the Galaxy Z Fold 2. The camera bump adds another 1.1mm (0.04 inches), apparently.S Pen support is also mentioned in this particular leak, emphasizing the role of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 as a high-end, premium-price replacement for the Galaxy Note 21 (at least this year – we'll have to wait and see if the Note makes a return in 2022).This all lines up nicely with what we've previously heard about the Galaxy Z Fold 3 in recent months, thanks to a flood of leaks and rumors. Nothing is confirmed until it's official, but it doesn't look as though Samsung is going to have much left to reveal when launch day comes around.Speaking of launch day, both the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3 are rumored to be arriving on August 3 – and we might even get a look at other devices, such as the Galaxy S21 FE and the Galaxy Watch 4, on the same day.It's only been a day since  appeared for the Galaxy Z Fold 3 – and in that case we did get an extra pink shade that hasn't shown up this time.

TodayDrone manufacturer Parrot’s latest offering, the ANAFI Ai, has a definite attention-grabbing feature – 4G connectivity. But just how useful is long-range control going to be in a drone whose useable flight time is under 25 minutes remains to be seen.
The ANAFI Ai is the first commercial drone to use 4G as the primary data link between the machine and the operator. The network-agnostic drone integrates a 4G radio module (in addition to the Wi-Fi radio) allowing operators to transmit a 1080p video with very low latency (300 ms).Technically, this “game-changing” innovation gives professionals the freedom to operate the drone at any distance, enabling Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) flights. But what does it mean in a real-world scenario, where the 900 gram drone comes with a flight time of 32 minutes?Read more: Weiliang Zhang, founder of Avetics Global, a drone solutions company based in Singapore and Malaysia, questions the need for 4G when the usable flight time is at most 23-24 minutes. He says:If you’re flying at 10m/s for a two-way trip of 14 km or a one-way trip of 7 km, that is still within range of other drones’ native transmission systems. Then, why pay a 4G premium?Zhang’s thoughts are echoed by DroneAnalyst’s David Benowitz, a former DJI Enterprise pro, who quips:Parrot has long refused to upgrade from horrible Wi-Fi tech, but then leapfrogs to 4G? The feature is marketed for BVLOS flights, but the drone’s flight time and speed are limiting factors. 4G would be great on a fixed-wing or transitional VTOL; I’m not sure it makes sense on a 900 g quadcopter. I can also see how a 4G connection could add reliability for the construction industry, but even then, a better Software Defined Radio (SDR) would be more cost-effective.Interestingly, the cost of the ANAFI Ai drone has not been revealed yet. But from the looks of it, Parrot would want to position the drone as a competitor to Skydio X2, the price for which starts at $10,999 with Skydio Enterprise Controller and accessories bundle.And if that is indeed going to be a benchmark for Parrot, we should point out that the ANAFI Ai uses stereoscopic cameras mounted on a 311-degree rotating gimbal for obstacle avoidance. Meanwhile, Skydio’s commercial drones come equipped with six 4K navigation cameras and powerful onboard AI for 360-degree obstacle avoidance.Related: Coming back to the topic, it’s worth noting that at the drone’s launch event on Wednesday, Henri Seydoux, founder and CEO of Parrot, did not play up long-range flying as much as he emphasized link security and stability that comes with 4G connectivity. According to Seydoux:With the 4G link, the connection between the drone and the pilot is much more secure. It is possible to fly along buildings or fly in places where the radio environment is very noisy, and still the link between the pilot and the drone will remain quite strong.Romeo Durscher, who oversees the public safety division at Auterion, an open-source drone software company, is also quick to point out that with 4G connectivity, the drone has become an internet of things (IoT) device. I’m reminded of the time when we released the Mavic Enterprise with a speaker and spotlight. People were saying that we had run out of ideas. ‘Why put a speaker on a drone?!’ And yet, the speaker and the spotlight have made this drone extremely valuable, setting a new path and thinking. The same will happen for ANAFI Ai’s 4G connectivity. Any enterprise drone which needs a SD card for data transfer is a glorified consumer drone. It sounds harsh but the future workflow must entail deeper data integration.And what about you? How do you view the ANAFI Ai’s 4G feature? Let us know in the comments below!

Sony has revealed an intriguing teaser for the launch of a ""new camera"", which is taking place next week on July 7.The teaser from the official Sony Alpha Universe site doesn't give much away about what the camera will be, but includes the tagline ""capture more of your world"" and includes an image of a 'dead cat' windshield for a microphone.This strongly suggests that the new camera will be a video-focused camera for vloggers and YouTubers – so if you're in the market for one of those, it'll be well worth tuning into the live launch on July 7 at 10am EDT / 3pm BST, which works as 12am AEST on July 8 for those in Australia.While Sony is being cagey about the new announcement, we can make some educated guesses based on the style and color scheme of the teaser.Sony used a very similar multi-colored background for the launch of the Sony ZV-1, a compact vlogging camera that sits top of our guide to the best YouTube cameras. In fact, there's even a frame from that launch (below, which took place in May 2020) that looks almost identical to the one for its incoming camera.Does this mean Sony is launching a successor to the Sony ZV-1? It's possible, but with that camera still being relatively new, it seems more likely that it'll launch an alternative camera in a similar vein.  Sony's big focus in the last 18 months has been launching compact, video-focused cameras for both professionals and amateur creators.That started with the arrival of the Sony ZV-1, which is a re-tooled version of its Sony RX100 series compact cameras, and was soon followed by the Sony A7S III in July 2020, a full-frame model that sits at the other end of the scale and has been hugely popular with filmmakers and YouTubers.Soon after, the full-frame Sony A7C arrived as a smaller, more affordable full-frame option for videographers, and we've also seen the Sony FX3 (which landed more recently in February) arrive as a similarly compact alternative in its Cinema line.In between all of this, stills photographers have been slightly frustrated by the lack of new photography-focused models, with no sign of the long-awaited Sony A7 IV. And this new teaser suggests that photographers hoping for that model will have to wait until after the launch another video-focused camera.This is good news for video creators, but what could the new launch be? Sony's strategy for its video cameras has been to rework existing models with a new video focus – the Sony ZV-1 came from its RX100 series compacts, while the Sony A7C is effectively a cross between its APS-C A6000 series and full-frame Sony A7 series.The rumors so far have suggested that the incoming model might follow the theme of the latter, only including an APS-C sensor rather than a full-frame one. If so, that would make it a more affordable option than the Sony A7C, but we'll have to wait for the full announcement to be sure.

This is a sponsored post written by Cloudinary. The opinions expressed in this article are the sponsor’s own.In our digital economy, patience for sluggish page loads is wearing thin. A slow-loading page means that visitors will likely bounce off, leading to a loss of page views and, ultimately, lost sales. Studies show that, if a page takes more than three seconds to load, as many as 40% of its visitors would abandon the site.Given today’s competitive landscape, brands simply can’t afford to have an underperforming website. To achieve SEO success—and keep customers happy—optimizing your media, site speed, and user experience are essential.In this column, you’ll learn about the opportunities that Core Web Vitals (CWVs) offer and hear from web performance experts as to where you should focus your SEO efforts now to reap the best possible results.In 2020, Google announced that its Core Web Vitals (CWVs) will, along with previous UX-related search signals like mobile-friendliness and HTTPS encryption, determine websites’ SEO page rankings in mid-2021.CWVs are based on exhaustive research on the aspects of an ideal web-user experience. The three metrics are Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Display (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), which assess a website’s load time, interactivity, and visual stability, respectively.The launch of the CWVs was recently postponed from May to a gradual rollout starting mid-June 2021, leading to completion by end-August.In a company statement, Google stated that it made that decision to allow companies “to make refinements … with page experience in mind.” The delay is great news for organizations given the recent evidence that 47% of websites have an LCP score of greater than 2.5 seconds, which means that nearly half of all websites fall into the Needs Improvement or Poor buckets. If an e-commerce site meets Google’s thresholds for all three metrics, visitors are 25% less likely to abandon it.Nonetheless, even with the extended time to get prepared, it is absolutely paramount that brands move quickly to improve their sites’ CWVs.Given the high expectations consumers have for site visits, web performance is vital for both user experience and business outcomes. Where should you focus your optimization efforts?Below are a few key takeaways from our recent conversations with Tim Kadlec, Harry Roberts, Tammy Everts, and Scott Jehl, who shared tips derived from their research and hands-on experience with brand sites.Catchpoint performance-engineering fellow Tim Kadlec says that the company has received numerous inquiries from clients on optimizing for CWVs.According to him, those concrete targets are the “clearest signal from Google yet on what constitutes good web performance.” Tim also adds, “I’ve seen a lot of organizations put focus on the CWVs right now because SEO ranking and the resulting traffic is a massive component of business success. Your reputation is going to be on the line based on whether you’re hitting these metrics.”Separately, consultant and front-end architect Harry Roberts told us that “nearly every inquiry we’ve received in 2021 relates to CWVs.” However, despite the search giant’s emphasis on the tremendous effect of those metrics on search, Roberts says, “I’ve been advising against panic. Those measurements are just one of many ranking factors.”His advice: “Businesses keen on accelerating page loads should focus on content delivery and metrics like LCP. Once a measurement is in hand, identify a page’s primary goal, work backward from there to form a hypothesis on why that page might be loading slowly, and then fix the issue.”In her 2016 book, , Tammy Everts pointed out that humans have a neurological need for quick, simple processes. She cited a study on task switching, which found that even a minor delay in load time for a website causes people to work 50% harder in terms of mental capacity.A similar study she referenced on mobile devices showed a comparable peak of user frustration. “That means our brains don’t manage expectations based on a device or task—we’re frustrated either way with lengthy load times,” added Tammy.In an electroencephalogram (EEG) study, Tammy tested a hypothesis that performance affected mobile users’ long-term perception of retail brands.Here’s her finding: “Where the only differentiator was perceived rendering time, those who experienced a slower site used three times more negative adjectives to describe the brand—boring, tacky, unhelpful—than those who experienced the faster version of the same site.”According to Scott Jehl, a hybrid designer-developer at Filament Group, tools for delivering images with HTML alone are extremely effective. He observes that “since 2016, responsive images have been working on more browsers. Plus, you can deliver an appropriate size on HTML by setting <src> and <size> attributes on <image> elements.“Why not also apply all your options with CSS and SVG for a rich look? Additionally, new and well-supported image and video formats, such as WebM, WebP, and AVIF, help deliver media faster and keep their weights in check. Tools that efficiently compress media and deliver pages are a tremendous help, especially for large e-commerce sites.”With today’s websites becoming more image- and video-centric, coupled with the urgency for digital-minded companies to improve user experience, the timing of Google’s CWVs could not be more perfect. Not only is Google being very clear about the metrics it’s using, but it’s also giving website developers ample time—along with very clear guidelines—to raise page rankings.Ultimately, that initiative will lead to better experiences for the online audience and, subsequently, for Google’s users—a win-win for everyone. Keep in mind that the metrics are based on actual page loads of actual user experiences in Chrome. That meaningful data is then used to boost the prominence of a site that Google is confident will attract users.With the digital economy taking precedence, optimized media will only grow in importance. Slower websites will be left in the dust, pushed further down in Google rankings where they might be completely overlooked. Those with strong CWVs scores will get a tie-breaking boost from Google.

"ST exclusive: S'pore could ease Covid-19 dine-in rules from July 12, may move to new normal by Sept, says Ong Ye Kung - The Straits Times
SINGAPORE - The as part of a three-step plan for the country's further reopening that could potentially seeas well as""Come July 12, we are looking at opening up to (allow) more people dining together, and whether there are other openings that we can consider,"" Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told The Straits Times' senior health correspondent Salma Khalik in an exclusive interview on Thursday (July 1).He added that this relaxation of measures is less dependent on vaccination rates, and more on whether Covid-19 clusters are under control.The next milestone for further easing will be in the second half of July, when half of the population would have been fully vaccinated, followed by National Day, when two-thirds of residents would have been inoculated, he added.“Hopefully we can mark (the milestone) with the National Day Parade as another step of opening, before we progress to the endemic Covid-19 stage. You want the transition to be a... step-by-step one, where you progressively move towards it, as opposed to a sudden change,” said the minister, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling Covid-19.Mr Ong said he also shares Singaporeans' aspirations for leisure travel to resume by the end of the year. Possible destinations would be countries with high vaccination rates, and which have seen downward trends in their infection rates.These include most countries in the European Union, as well as the United States.“Once a place’s (Covid-19) infection rate is going down, vaccinations are going up and you go below, say, two or three infections per 100,000 (people), we should start monitoring those countries seriously,” he said.Asked if end-August or early September would be a good time to switch gears to the new normal - given that all who want to and are eligible for the jab would have been inoculated - Mr Ong said this was a realistic timeframe, based on the country's vaccine supplies.""What you would see is not a big-bang opening end of August or September, but a progressive one,"" he added.The that Singapore will transition to a new normal where Covid-19 will be managed like other endemic diseases.Asked if this is a deviation from when he spoke of ramping up vaccinations, contact tracing and testing, Mr Ong clarified that this was not the case.The key message of PM Lee's speech is that vaccination is the key to helping Singapore transition to the new normal, he said.""We are in this transition phase of vaccinating more of our population... For us to arrive at a percentage that we are comfortable with, that transition process will take a month or two more. And during that phase, testing remains very important,"" said Mr Ong, who noted that 37 per cent of the population is now fully vaccinated, with 57 per cent to 58 per cent partially vaccinated.

There are also other key considerations in transitioning tothough the decision had been made based on science, he added.After an extended period of restrictions, fatigue has set in, and there is a certain sense of battle weariness among people.""You cannot expect people to live like that - restricting themselves, not meeting friends, not being able to travel,"" he said, noting that some have been apart from families, and that some workers have not been allowed to enter the country.There are also other major considerations, such as the trajectory of the pandemic, as well as the development of the vaccines and treatments Singapore now has at its disposal that could make living with endemic Covid-19 a possibility.While scientists estimate that a vaccination rate of at least 80 per cent is required for the population to gain herd immunity against the Delta variant, Mr Ong said that people can still live with an endemic Covid-19 if this is not achieved.""People will still get infected, but they are fine. And so you make Covid-19 more like influenza, you don't make Covid-19 like measles, for example, where you try to eradicate (it).""But Mr Ong said, noting that  amid a rise in coronavirus cases, just days after it lifted the measure.“Masks, to me, are a very important non-pharmaceutical intervention, and may well be one of the last things we want to consider removing,” he said. Even if mask-wearing requirements are removed, this will perhaps be just for safer outdoor environments, such as parks, he said.“In terms of risk and reward, it is one of the most sensible things to do.”Read more from ST's exclusive interview with Health Minister Ong Ye Kung:

SINGAPORE - The two sons of former Singapore president Ong Teng Cheong are facing off in court in a dispute over shareholdings in the holding company that controls the family business.Older brother Tze Guan, who holds 28.45 per cent in Ong&Ong Holdings, has sued his younger brother Tze Boon and six other shareholders for minority oppression.The suit, filed in April, was first reported by Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao on Thursday (July 1).Mr Ong, who served as Singapore's first elected president from 1993 to 1999, died at 66 years old in 2002.In his court filing, Tze Guan alleges that Tze Boon, who holds a 70.43 per cent stake in the family's architecture and engineering business, had conducted the affairs of the group of companies in a manner that was oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to him.The conduct included Tze Guan's removal as a director from nine companies in the group between June 2018 and January 2019, as well as other financial matters.Tze Guan is asking the High Court to order the defendants to buy him out, either at an agreed price or at a price fixed by an independent expert.However, Tze Boon and the other defendants contend in their defence that Tze Guan's allegations are factually and legally baseless.Tze Boon has made a counterclaim against his older brother, seeking the repayment of an outstanding personal loan - with interest - he had given Tze Guan two decades ago.According to court papers, Tze Boon loaned Tze Guan a total of $700,000 in 2002 and 2003. Tze Guan has repaid $219,983.56.Tze Boon has also counterclaimed against Tze Guan for defamation.He contends that various allegations of minority oppression set out in letters sent to them by Tze Guan's lawyers on April 21 last year amounted to defamation.This article was first published in The Straits Times. Permission required for reproduction.",https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_image/public/original_images/Jul2021/20210701_sons_mypaperfileong%26ong.jpg?itok=c79w33c5,"Singapore's unemployment rates continue to fall in May - CNA
SINGAPORE: Singapore's unemployment situation continued to improve in May in what authorities said was a good sign, although the road to recovery was expected to be long.The overall unemployment rate edged down to 2.8 per cent in May from 2.9 per cent the previous month, according to the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) latest monthly unemployment situation report.The jobless rate for citizens fell to 4 per cent in May from 4.1 per cent in April, while the rate for residents dipped to 3.8 per cent from 3.9 per cent.In May, 88,600 residents were unemployed, including 79,000 citizens.
