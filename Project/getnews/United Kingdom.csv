"Jadon Sancho transfer to Manchester United for £73m confirmed by Borussia Dortmund - Sky Sports
Manchester United have agreed a £73m deal to sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund, the German club have confirmed. The Bundesliga side made a stock exchange announcement on Thursday morning, which also confirmed Sancho has agreed personal terms with United, with the transfer set be completed subject to a medical.""The player Jadon Sancho is about to move from Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KGaA to Manchester United Football Club Limited,"" the announcement said.""Both clubs and the player reached an agreement on this today. If the transfer is realised, Manchester United will pay BVB a fixed transfer fee of EUR 85.0 million.""The contractual details now have to be coordinated and documented. The formal processing of the transfer is also subject to the successful completion of all necessary medical tests and examinations, a coordination procedure with the player's previous club and the proper and timely processing in accordance with the provisions of the FIFA Transfer Matching System.""The agreement was also confirmed by Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke, as the club held a news conference to unveil new head coach Marco Rose.Watzke said: ""We reached a general agreement with Manchester United on the transfer of Jadon Sancho, pending full completion, as there are still some formalities to agree on and the medical check to be completed.""Dortmund's asking price at the start of the window was in excess of £85m and the deal is also £35m less than the £108m valuation last summer.The forward's contract at Dortmund runs until the summer of 2023 and they do not want to risk him entering the final year of his deal.The Bundesliga club are actively looking at replacements, with PSV's Donyell Malen and Noni Madueke two players they have extensively scouted.Sancho's former club Manchester City retain a sell-on clause and are set for a cash windfall from their cross-city rivals should the transfer go through.Sancho swiftly established himself as a key player at Dortmund, and has scored 50 goals in 137 appearances for the German club.It could be argued Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have more pressing needs in other areas. Many fans might prefer a central defender. But Sancho has emerged as one of the world's most exciting young players in recent years and it is easy to understand why United are so determined to finally get their man.Manchester United will host rivals Leeds United at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the 2021/22 Premier League season.United face a possibly season-defining run of games in October and November, which starts with a trip to Leicester on October 16, the first showdown with Liverpool at Old Trafford on October 23, and a visit to Tottenham on October 30.November 6 marks the first Manchester derby of the season as champions Manchester City travel to Old Trafford, before United head to Champions League winners Chelsea on November 27 before rounding off the month by hosting Arsenal on November 30.",https://e0.365dm.com/21/06/768x432/skysports-jadon-sancho-borussia-dortmund_5427341.jpg?20210625185718,"Andy Murray rebukes Boris Johnson over ‘pathetic’ 1% NHS pay rise - The Independent
Answering questions after the game, he said it was “fantastic” many frontline health workers and other key figures of the pandemic had been recognised by being invited to the championships.“I think the whole country kind of realised how important they all are, and maybe hadn’t got the recognition that they probably deserve up until now,” Murray said.“So, yeah, it’s fantastic that they have been able to come along and watch some of the tennis. Hopefully they can enjoy it and, yeah, hopefully the politicians can realise that they deserve more than what they are getting paid just now.“I think, what is it, they got something like a 1% pay rise? It was pathetic. So, yeah, they obviously deserve a lot more than that. They have done an amazing job getting us through the pandemic.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March insisted the 1% payrise allocated to NHS staff was as much as the Government could afford amid the financially tight times of the pandemic, although Labour said it went against a Government promise made last year for a 2.1% pay rise.With Wimbledon resuming this summer after being cancelled last year, tournament officials have been applauded for inviting various people who have been at the forefront of the fight against the pandemic.Inside centre court on Monday, Oxford University’s Dame Sarah Gilbert - co-creator of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - was given a standing ovation by the crowd when her attendance was announced. Oxford colleague Sir Andrew Pollard, another co-creator of the vaccine, was also present on Monday.An ovation was also given for Hannah Ingram, daughter of Captain Sir Tom Moore, who last year raised £33 million of pounds for the NHS.The centre court announcer said NHS critical care staff were also in attendance, along with key workers at Transport for London and other “inspirational workers” who have contributed to Britain’s pandemic battle, while more figures would be recognised through the Wimbledon fortnight.Murray, the injury-plagued dual champion of the tournament, reached the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time in four years through his five-set win over Germany’s Oscar Otte.Asked about the nation’s other current obsession - Euro 2020 - the 34-year-old Surrey-dwelling Murray put his Scottish roots aside to wishEngland well.“It’s a great opportunity for England to win a major competition for the first time in a while,” he said. “Hopefully they can do it.”Andy Murray won a second-round game lasting nearly four hoursWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Farhad Moshiri has directly addressed critics of his decision to appoint Rafael Benitez as Everton manager, claiming he listened to fan protests and decided against David Moyes in the past.The Blues confirmed their new boss on Wednesday afternoon, with the Spaniard signing a three-year deal at Goodison Park to take over after the surprise departure of Carlo Ancelotti at the beginning of the month.This is the fifth manager the club's owner has appointed in as many years, but the decision has been met with widespread disdain across the Everton fanbase.However the majority shareholder made clear that he has listened to the fans in the past, especially in going against his wish to appoint Moyes following Marco Silva's sacking in 2019.

Get the latest United transfer window updates, news and analysis delivered straight to your inbox every day for freeThey were only on the pitch together for 21 minutes. They only passed to each other a handful of times. Yet Luke Shaw and Jack Grealish's link-up down the left was the key factor as England defeated old foes Germany to send the country wild.One of the few who may not have been quite as pleased, however, is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who, if he watched the game, might have done so in frustration as he looked on at what he could have had at Manchester United.While England had asserted themselves well in the opening 69 minutes of the Euro 2020 last-16 clash, effectively neutralising Germany's threat from the flanks, they had rarely threatened Manuel Neuer's goal since Harry Kane's first-half opportunity.But Gareth Southgate's brave introduction of Grealish helped swing momentum in England's favour. With the Aston Villa captain replacing Bukayo Saka, Raheem Sterling switched sides to the right and Grealish took up position on the left. This immediately made the Three Lions better going forward as, with Grealish keen on cutting inside, acres of space left open for Shaw to exploit. Earlier in the match, the United left-back and Sterling were repeatedly getting in each other's way and struggling to get good attacking synergy down the left, making England unbalanced and a little toothless.But with Shaw given room to work, he helped stretch the German defence and worked in tandem with his attacking partner instead of tripping up over him.It's exactly how the opening goal, just six minutes following the switch, occurred, with Sterling gathering the ball on the right and driving forwards before playing into Kane. The captain then nudged the ball to Grealish who easily played the ball into Shaw's path for him to make the killer cross. Sterling tapped home and we're singing in the streets.Eleven minutes later the pair combined once again for England to score, though this time the roles were reversed, with Shaw winning the ball in the middle and playing it out to Grealish who put it on a plate for Kane. The pair may have only had a brief time on the pitch together but their blossoming partnership bodes well for the rest of the tournament and could leave Solskjaer ruing missed opportunities.Plenty of clubs have been keen on Grealish over the years but United have tended to be at the front of the queue. In February 2020 the club made contact with Villa to make their intentions of moving for the 25-year-old clear well in advance of the window and to steal a march on any potential competitors for his signature.The Villains were in dire straits at the time and looked set for an instant return to the Championship, which had United hopeful that they would be able to snap up Grealish for a relative bargain. Ironically, when the season finally concluded, it was Grealish's own brilliance that dragged his boyhood club out of the mire and to safety, but significantly increasing his price tag and decreasing Villa's need to sell in the process.With United unwilling to spend massive fees in the summer of 2020 at the height of the pandemic, Grealish remained at Villa where he once again shone this past season to earn his way into Southgate's England squad.Instead, United brought in Donny van de Beek in what at the time appeared to be a coup for £35.1million, but the move has not gone to plan for either party just yet.It now seems that Grealish could finally make the move to Manchester this summer - to rivals City, with Pep Guardiola not making his admiration for the playmaker a secret.Jadon Sancho, a player the club have also been tracking for a long time, is United's top attacking target this summer and he would make an excellent addition to the squad. But with a deal not set in stone just yet there is still time for United to reconsider. With Grealish a proven Premier League quality and already showing he can do great things with United's players, perhaps a late change of heart would be the right decision?United have seen what they could have had if they signed Grealish and it isn't too late to make it a reality.",https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article20940575.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1233720928.jpg

"Four Covid symptoms experts say must be added to official list of signs - see in full - The Mirror
Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inbox Scientists want the UK to follow other countries and include a broader range of symptoms that have been linked to a Covid-19 infection. Limiting testing to only people with a fever, a new or continuous cough and a change in taste or smell could ""miss or delay identification of many Covid cases"", it's argued.The US Centres for Disease Control lists 11 more symptoms than the UK, and the World Health Organisation includes nine more.Calum Semple, the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) group, said the Government's list of Covid symptoms should be expanded.He told BBC Breakfast: ""As older people are vaccinated, proportionally more younger people are having disease and they have a different group of symptoms.""By extending the symptom list, we think we'll pick up about a third more cases. But, more importantly, we'll pick them up a day earlier and that offers greater opportunity to break transmission chains and stop further spread of the virus."" He added that the challenge is to make sure people are getting the ""right"" test for their symptoms but also encouraged anyone who is feeling unwell with any of the coronavirus symptoms to get tested. ""We don't want to overwhelm the PCR testing; we probably want to encourage more people to do lateral flow testing in the community, and then get a PCR to confirm it,"" he said.Here are four of the other symptoms the experts says should be added to the official NHS list.Headaches are often one of the first signs of the disease but are not part of the official symptoms list in the UK, even though they are in the US. Tests show 39 percent reported headaches when testing positive for the potentially deadly disease.A new and persistent headache is a warning sign that you might need to get tested, and some researchers have found that some sufferers continue to report having headaches after their main symptoms have cleared.The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics shows 61 per cent of people who tested positive for coronavirus reported symptoms other than the Government's official list. Around one in three, or 32 per cent, of people said a sore throat was one of them. The ONS says that having a cough, sore throat or fatigue is more common for patients in the South East of England infected with the so-called Kent variant.The 'second wave' infections caused by variants are more likely to cause upper respiratory tract issues - in other words, coughs and colds, researchers at Imperial College London notes.Muscle ache was reported as a symptom of by a quarter of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in recent studies.A general feeling of lethargy - a lack of energy and inactivity - is something medics want added to the list of symptoms to consider.Fatigue is also one of the common symptoms reported by patients with Long Covid, where side effects of the disease continue long after the main infection has passed.Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children infected with coronavirus and should be grounds for testing for the virus, according to researchers. that the most common signs in the half of children that did get symptoms were diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Tom Waterfield, lead author of the antibodies study, told the BMJ: “Based on our findings I think that gastrointestinal symptoms should be added to the current list—high temperature, cough, and loss or change in sense of smell or taste—that trigger testing for coronavirus.“Diarrhoea and vomiting in children should trigger a test.”There are only three 'main symptoms' of Covid, according to the NHS.A high temperature and a new or continuous cough are on the official government list.A loss or change in smell or taste are also a key health change to consider.Now the pressure is growing as the group argue that it ""hampers efforts to interrupt transmission"" of the virus, because cases with non-traditional symptoms are being missed.",https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/sLoHaTZ7/poster.jpg,"COVID-19: Pet owners can pass on coronavirus to their cats and dogs, study suggests - Sky News
COVID-19 is common in pets whose owners have had the disease, research suggests.Scientists in the Netherlands tested 156 dogs and 154 cats from 196 households for the coronavirus.Six cats and seven dogs (4.2%) returned positive PCR tests and 31 cats and 23 dogs (17.4%) tested positive for COVID antibodies.Researchers said owners who contract COVID should avoid contact with their pets while infected.Dr Els Broens, from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, said: ""If you have COVID-19, you should avoid contact with your cat or dog, just as you would do with other people.""The main concern, however, is not the animals' health - they had no or mild symptoms of COVID-19 - but the potential risk that pets could act as a reservoir of the virus and reintroduce it into the human population.""Fortunately, to date no pet-to-human transmission has been reported.""So, despite the rather high prevalence among pets from COVID-19 positive households in this study, it seems unlikely that pets play a role in the pandemic.""Eight cats and dogs that lived in the same homes as the pets that tested positive for the virus were also swabbed for a second time to check for virus transmission among pets.None tested positive, suggesting the virus was not being passed between pets living in close contact with one another.The research led by Dr Broens was presented at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) but has not yet been published in a journal.Separate research, also presented to the ECCMID, suggests cats that sleep on their owner's bed may be at particular risk of contracting the disease.Dorothee Bienzle, a professor of veterinary pathology at the University of Guelph in Canada, who presented the findings, said: ""If you have COVID-19, I'd advise that you keep your distance from your pet - and keep it out of your bedroom.""She also suggested keeping coronavirus-infected animals away from other people and their pets.Prof Bienzle said: ""While the evidence that pets can pass the virus on to other pets is limited, it can't be excluded.""Similarly, although pets have not been shown to pass the virus back to people, the possibility can't be completely ruled out.""Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, SpreakerCommenting on the findings, Professor James Wood, head of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said both studies are consistent with ""a growing number of studies that are suggesting that a substantial proportion of pet cats and dogs may catch Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19) from their owners"".He added: ""Cats and dogs may commonly be infected with the virus, but most reports are that this infection appears to be asymptomatic.""It also seems that the virus does not normally transmit from dogs and cats to either other animals or their owners.""These studies need to be differentiated from earlier work that has reported a very small number of individual cats and dogs to be unwell after they caught COVID-19 from their owners.""",https://e3.365dm.com/21/01/768x432/2372101250253336907_5249868.jpg?20210125124539

NASA's new Deep Space Atomic Clock - designed to provide a GPS-like system for spacecraft - is up to 10 times more stable than existing space clocks, new research has found.Ground-based atomic clocks have been the gold standard for timekeeping since the 1950s, but now a new device launched into space in 2019 is set to revolutionise interplanetary navigation.At the moment travelling through space requires the spacecraft to communicate back to Earth, introducing a delay before it receives confirmation of its position, including any new directions.But the Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC), developed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, will allow spacecraft to navigate autonomously with minimal communication to and from Earth.New research published in the journal Nature, from a team of scientists led by Eric Burt at the California Institute of Technology, has found that the DSAC has such a ""low sensitivity to variations in radiation, temperature and magnetic fields"" that it will enable ""near real-time navigation of deep space probes"".Atomic clocks are currently used onboard GPS satellites, but they need to be updated twice a day to fix their natural drift, with those updates coming from much larger and more stable clocks on the ground.The ground-based clocks can be the size of a fridge and would not survive the journey into space, but the DSAC - which is expected to be off by less than a microsecond (one millionth of a second) after 10 years, or one second every 10 million years - is the size of a shoebox.It only has a life expectancy of up to five years, but this could be doubled the scientists believe, adding that the technology underpinning it - using the extremely regular resonance of mercury ions, stored within an electromagnetic ""trap"" to prevent interference - means the DSAC can safely operate in space to help spacecraft navigate.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/06/768x432/skynews-nasa-dsac-deep-space_5432673.jpg?20210630185626,"Elon Musk lashes out as stray helicopter blocks planned SpaceX launch - The Independent
SpaceX chief Elon Musk has hit out at US airspace regulations after his company was forced to reschedule a rocket launch due to an unauthorised aircraft entering the so-called “keep out zone”.With SpaceX just seconds away from launching 88 different satellites on its new  mission, the countdown was halted due to a stray helicopter coming into range of the launch site. The incident, which will now delay the mission by at least a day, drew the ire of tech billionaire Musk on Twitter. “Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the ‘keep out zone’, which is unreasonably gigantic,” Musk tweeted after the launch was halted.“There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilisation without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken,” he said.According to local TV news reports, the aircraft was a private helicopter that entered the restricted area in the final 11 seconds before launch. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) spokesperson told US media that the government body is investigating the incident.While the company’s launches have been called off in the past due to circumstances like bad weather, Tuesday’s incident could be the first due to an air traffic disturbance.Musk had previously criticised the FAA in January after a starship test was delayed.“Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure,” the SpaceX chief had similarly tweeted then.With the company launching rockets at a brisk space this year – an average of nearly once every nine days – Musk said the FAA’s air traffic rules are meant only for a “handful of expendable launches” per year from a few government facilities.“Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars,” he said.While Musk publicly criticises regulators, he had also said in April that he agreed with them “99.9 per cent of the time.”“On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn’t anticipate,” the SpaceX chief noted.In a recent Congressional hearing, members of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, including representative Peter DeFazio, expressed concerns over increasing air traffic as a result of the growing number of spaceflight missions in US air space.“I am not in favour of telling people in America who are travelling for pleasure or for work or whatever reason on a commercial airplane that their flights are delayed by an hour and a half because some billionaire is going to experience 15 minutes of weightlessness. I want to see that does not happen,” Mr DeFazio said.FAA associate administrator Wayne Monteith, who spoke at the hearing, said the first operational tests of Space Data Integrator – a system designed to support integration of launches into the national airspace system, limiting the size and duration of airspace restrictions – could address these concerns in a few months.Elon Musk, founder and chief engineer of SpaceX, speaks at the 2020 Satellite Conference and Exhibition in March 2020Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Climate change pushed dinosaurs into a period of decline 10 million years before the 12-km-wide asteroid which brought about their extinction fell to Earth, a new study claims. While paleontologists have been in agreement for some time about the cause of dinosaurs’ eventual demise, until now experts have been divided on whether the reptilian group were thriving or struggling before the sudden end of the Mesozoic Era 66 million years ago. Now, an international team of scientists including experts from the University of Bristol have declared that dinosaurs experienced a sudden downturn 76 million years ago, when rates of extinction began to rise.They pinned this to a period of global cooling on Earth when the mean temperature fell by 7C, putting dinosaurs which favoured warmer temperatures at a disadvantage.Researchers found that plant-eating species tended to disappear first, which in turn made ecosystems unstable and put other dinosaur families at risk of collapse. Watch: How life before the dinosaurs could help us understand the consequences of global warming todayProfessor Mike Benton from the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences, one of the study’s co-authors, said: “In the analyses, we explored different kinds of possible causes of the dinosaur decline.“It became clear that there were two main factors, first that overall climates were becoming cooler, and this made life harder for the dinosaurs which likely relied on warm temperatures. “Then, the loss of herbivores made the ecosystems unstable and prone to extinction cascade. We also found that the longer-lived dinosaur species were more liable to extinction, perhaps reflecting that they could not adapt to the new conditions on Earth.”Fabien Condamine, lead author from France’s Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution de Montpellier, said: “We looked at the six most abundant dinosaur families through the whole of the Cretaceous, spanning from 150 to 66 million years ago, and found that they were all evolving and expanding and clearly being successful.“Then, 76 million years ago, they show a sudden downturn. Their rates of extinction rose and in some cases the rate of origin of new species dropped off.“This was a key moment in the evolution of life. The world had been dominated by dinosaurs for over 160 million years, and as they declined other groups began their rise to dominance, including the mammals. “The dinosaurs were mostly so huge they probably hardly knew that the furry little mammals were there in the undergrowth. “But the mammals began to increase in numbers of species before the dinosaurs had gone, and then after the impact they had their chance to build new kinds of ecosystems which we see today.”Researchers accounted for paleontological uncertainties including incomplete fossil records and age-dating discrepancies by running modelling software millions of times before agreeing on the most probable date of decline.Phil Currie, a co-author of the study, from the University of Edmonton, in Alberta, Canada, said: ”We used over 1,600 carefully checked records of dinosaurs through the Cretaceous. “I have been collecting dinosaurs in North America, Mongolia, China, and other areas for some time, and I have seen huge improvements in our knowledge of the ages of the dinosaur-bearing rock formations. “This means that the data are getting better all the time. The decline in dinosaurs in their last 10 million years makes sense, and indeed this is the best-sampled part of their fossil record as our study shows.”The findings were published in the journal, Nature Communications.Watch: Top 5 swaps for sustainable livingRead More",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/d_4oYn5VjxF6Wn_S31PaEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTc1NC4xMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMz/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8XoXD.GWtZgftNDqEyby1A--~B/aD0zNTM1O3c9NDUwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/0643eadb794201003697c4c5a70ba611,"What happens when black holes collide with the most dense stars in the universe - The Conversation UK
Martin Krause receives funding from the Science and Technology Facilities Council and is a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft, the European Astronomical Society, the International Astronomical Union and the German Physical Society.View all partnersFor the first time, a faint signal caused by the merging of two almost equally mysterious objects – a black hole and a neutron star – has been recorded on Earth.On January 5 2020, when the world was first learning of the COVID-19 outbreak, gravitational waves from this merging reached the Livingston detector of the ) gravitational wave observatory in Louisiana, US. On January 15, the second gravitational wave event from a merger between a black hole and a neutron star, the densest stars in the universe, was discovered.These two recordings are the first mergers between a black hole and a neutron star  to have been detected on Earth. Black hole-neutron star binary systems, where a black hole and a neutron star orbit each other, had been predicted but never observed – until now.Gravitational waves are distortions in space-time, predicted by Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In a , the distance between two suspended mirrors is measured with a laser. The measurement technique relies on the overlap of reflected laser light within the experiment. Two light waves are arranged so that the signals cancel each other out exactly. Changing the distance between the mirrors by even a tiny fraction of a wavelength produces a measurable light signal.The basic idea behind the theory of relativity is that space itself possesses a kind of elastic structure, even in the absence of any matter. Similar to an inflated balloon, you can squeeze it one way and it expands in the perpendicular direction. Relativity predicts that matter warps space (and time) and a collision between two compact objects like a black hole and a neutron star rapidly changes the compression and relaxation of the space in the vicinity of the objects. Waves of periodic compression and expansion are emitted. The way to measure these waves is to monitor the distance between two otherwise fixed objects, because the gravitational wave will periodically change the extent of the space between these objects, as it passes.During the first ever detected gravitational wave event in 2015, for which three physicists were awarded the Nobel prize in 2017, the distances between the mirrors in the two stations of the LIGO observatory, which are 4km (2.5 miles) apart, changed by about a thousandth of a trillionth of a millimetre. The merger detected in 2015 was between two comparatively massive black holes, each around 30 times the mass of the Sun. Since then, the sensitivity of the instrument has been improved. Now also a smaller, less sensitive, gravitational wave observatory in Italy, called the Virgo experiment, is frequently used as part of the telescope network. In the new discoveries, the merging objects each had less than ten times the mass of the Sun. The event on January 5 involved objects with respective masses of 8.9 and 1.9 times the mass of the Sun, and the merger on January 15 was between objects with 5.7 and a 1.5 times the mass of the Sun.It’s important that the smaller masses were below 2.2 times the mass of the Sun, because this suggests these objects were neutron stars. Neutron stars are so dense that an amount of matter comparable to the solar system is compressed to a diameter of about 20km.The matter in a neutron star is so dense that atoms get crushed, resulting in the formation of neutrons. The strong gravity on their surface makes them, in their own right, interesting laboratories to study effects of general relativity. When a neutron star becomes even more massive, for example when some interstellar gas falls on it, the nuclear forces can no longer resist gravity and the star collapses to a black hole, an object so compact that not even light can resist its gravitational pull.

Neutron stars and black holes are not that rare in the Milky Way. They are a common outcome from the evolution of stars significantly more massive than the Sun. Such massive stars often occur in binary systems, with two stars orbiting each other.It’s not surprising to find neutron stars and black holes in binary systems, where they are locked in a gravitational dance. Such binaries emit gravitational waves for their entire lifetime.The energy for the gravitational waves comes from the motion of the objects around each other. As the system emits gravitational waves, the objects get closer together. This makes the gravitational wave emission increase and, finally, the two merge into a new, bigger black hole, with a burst of gravitational wave emission. This is what is detectable on Earth.While it was expected that neutron star-black hole systems existed, we’d never been able to spot them before. Neutron stars emit radio and X-ray emissions, which can now be routinely detected. Other than looking for gravitational waves, black holes can only be observed when something falls on them – a star or interstellar gas, for example.If a black hole has a normal star companion, it can capture mass from the companion which emits X-rays before it disappears into the black hole. Binary black holes have no obvious source of gas, and they’re known only from gravitational wave experiments. A neutron star-black hole system could in principle be discovered with radio telescopes, but – so far – the search has not been successful. This new discovery provides important information about the astrophysics of such systems. More discoveries will surely be made, which will help to improve our understanding of what is inside neutron stars and black holes – and quite possibly also provide new tests, or proofs, of the theory of relativity.

Detections of methane on Mars have excited scientists because, on Earth, the gas is often produced by microbes - its presence could indicate that similar life was, or is, present on the red planet.There are potential geological processes that could produce methane too, but even before identifying the source of the gas on Mars, scientists have been trying to solve another mystery.The detections of methane aren't consistent. Some instruments, such as on NASA's Curiosity rover, have repeatedly detected the gas above the surface of the Gale Crater. Another, on ESA's (European Space Agency) orbiter, hasn't found any traces of methane higher up in the Martian atmosphere.Aboard the Curiosity rover is an instrument called the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) which has detected varying amounts of methane - from less than one-half part per billion ""equivalent to about a pinch of salt diluted in an Olympic-size swimming pool"" to up to 20 parts per billion.The issue isn't be one of design or malfunction.The TLS instrument is so precise it has been licensed for use in industrial systems and fighter aircraft to monitor for gas levels.ESA's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter is ""designed to be the gold standard for measuring methane and other gases over the whole planet"", explained NASA, and yet it - contrary to all expectations - was finding no methane at all.""When the Trace Gas Orbiter came on board in 2016, I was fully expecting the orbiter team to report that there’s a small amount of methane everywhere on Mars,"" said Chris Webster, who leads the TLS instrument for NASA.""When the European team announced that it saw no methane, I was definitely shocked,"" he added.The TLS team checked to see if the rover was releasing the gas itself somehow.""We looked at correlations with the pointing of the rover, the ground, the crushing of rocks, the wheel degradation -you name it. I cannot overstate the effort the team has put into looking at every little detail to make sure those measurements are correct, and they are.""At this point, John Moores, a scientist from York University in Toronto proposed a counter-intuitive solution.""I took what some of my colleagues are calling a very Canadian view of this, in the sense that I asked the question: 'What if Curiosity and the Trace Gas Orbiter are both right?'"" Moores said.Working with the Curiosity team, Moores hypothesised that the discrepancy between the measurements came down to the time of day they were taken.The TLS, they realised, operates mostly at night when Curiosity's other instruments are sleeping. As the Martian atmosphere is calm at night, any methane seeping up from the ground builds up near the surface.The orbiter however depends on sunlight to pinpoint trace gases about 5km from the planet's surface. As the atmosphere is more active during the day, any methane present would have been diluted to undetectable levels.Experiments quickly confirmed that this was the case, but another mystery remained even beyond the origin of the methane: Why was it disappearing?Methane is a stable molecule. Even without a protective atmosphere, it is expected to last for 300 years on Mars before solar radiation tears it apart.If it is constantly seeping from all craters on the planet - something which researchers believe, as there is apparently nothing geologically unique about the Gale Crater - then there should be enough in the atmosphere for the orbiter to detect.The researchers are now experimenting to see whether ""very low-level electric discharges induced by dust in the Martian atmosphere could destroy methane, or whether abundant oxygen at the Martian surface quickly destroys methane before it can reach the upper atmosphere"".""We need to determine whether there’s a faster destruction mechanism than normal to fully reconcile the data sets from the rover and the orbiter,"" Webster said.After that, the team can try and figure out where the methane is coming from.",https://e3.365dm.com/19/04/768x432/skynews-rover-nasa-mars-mars-rover_4626539.jpg?20190401234926
"Diablo 4 will actually let you customise your character's face - Rock Paper Shotgun

Diablo IV is still an unknown amount of time away from launch, but Blizzard are keeping up with their quarterly blog posts digging into details about the next big hack 'n slash RPG. Up for show and tell this time is Diablo 4's character customisation, which there sure is going to be a heck of a lot of for a game largely played looking down at the top of your own head. That's because Blizzard are planning some flashy ""cinematic"" moments with your very own character, they say. Don't forget to dye your armor while you're at it.

  You'll be able to express your character through a bunch of different armor choices, of course. Blizzard say that, unlike previous Diablo games, you'll also be able to go into a decent amount of detail with their faces. They gave quite a list of features that you'll be able to customise about your character in Diablo 4.

  It's not a list that rivals some of the most impressive modern RPG character creators, but it's quite a lot for Diablo. Why all that facial detail for a game where you're usually looking down on yourself? 

  Blizz say that there are a lot of places you'll see your character, such as the character customisation screen, your inventory, and social menus. Your personal character will also show up in some of Diablo 4's snazzy cinematics too.

  ""In previous Diablo games, the high fidelity cinematic story moments were all pre-rendered,"" they say. ""We will still have those amazing cinematic moments from Blizzard Animation, but now we also have cinematic moments that feature your character up close, rendered in our game engine.""

  The rogue class announcement trailer up there, for example, Blizzard say ""was created entirely in our game engine"".

  Blizzard go over a couple other areas in this quarterly update. They talk a bit about monster designs, the game camera, and dyeing armors. In particular, those big chunks of dyed fabric are giving me aughties MMO flashbacks. In a way that makes me miss them a bit, I mean. 

  You can catch the rest of the details in their June quarterly update post for some extra screenshots and videos of customising your own character.

  Blizzard haven't been shy about showing off Diablo 4 development even though they've not announced a launch window. They've previously given a look at the Diablo 4 skill tree, its varied overworld, and .  and 

  We don't know yet when to expect Diablo IV's launch, but the latest indications from Blizz suggest no earlier than 2022.

The 2021 Call of Duty codename may have just leaked on Battle.net, and an accompanying logo offers clues for the setting for this year’s game.According to Tom Henderson, Call of Duty 2021 has been added to Battle.net along with the name Slipstream. A logo was also included which shows the Slipstream name and a design that features the name filled in with a sky design. It's unclear if Slipstream is the official title or just a temporary codename.Call of Duty 2021 has updated on https://t.co/hsFaJ0phsm as ""Call of Duty: Slipstream"" with the attached logo. Looks very WW2 to me. That there will be a new Call of Duty game this year is not new. For over a decade Call of Duty has reliably been an annual franchise, delivering a new game each year without fail even compared to other year franchises like Battlefield and Assassin’s Creed which have slowed down their pace.The Slipstream codename and logo are reminiscent of fighter planes, potentially hinting at some kind of theme. But other than the project remains a mystery.We do know that, again, Activision has confirmed a new Call of Duty game will be coming out this holiday, and that .However, last we heard, the code name for the project was called Vanguard, and reports from Eurogamer have said that it will return to World War 2, the setting for the last Sledgehammer Call of Duty game.Call of Duty leaks are also a yearly occurrence, and folks usually find out the next entry before an official reveal.

PUBG's much-teased Taego map has finally arrived on PC test servers, bringing with it some new features including self-revives and a special ""second chance"" mechanic. Well... new to PUBG, at least. The freshly-released patch notes explain that Taego is an 8x8 map set in 1980s South Korea, with landscapes ""ranging from wide-open reed fields to the close quarters of Hosan Prison"". It's also got some wildlife, with flocks of birds that react to player movement and gunfire, so take your binoculars with you - those birds might just help you track down another squad. If you stream yourself doing that, you're a twitcher in two senses of the word. The map also has a new feature called Comeback BR, which gives players who die before the first Blue Zone the ability to get themselves back into the game. All you have to do is stay alive in a separate ""Comeback Arena"" for a certain amount of time. It sounds pretty similar to Call of Duty: Warzone's Gulag, except it's more like another mini battle royale rather than a one-on-one battle to the death. Players who survive are reintroduced to the main game in phase three of the match, complete with all their items and gear. PUBG Patch 12.2: Taego, Comeback BR and Other New FeaturesAnother mechanic is also being introduced to give players a second chance, and it's the ability to self-revive. The Self AED is another Taego-exclusive mechanic, and does... well, exactly what it says on the tin. Elsewhere in the update there's a new vehicle called the Pony Coupe, a four-seater car that should fare well in rough conditions, and new weapons in the form of the K2 assault rifle and Mk12 DMR (both of which can be found on Taego). It's worth noting that loot is being increased more generally across PUBG, with maps receiving loot boosts of between 16.5 and 28.4 percent in response to player feedback.   As usual, there's a new Survivor Pass (this time based on Taego), but this one has some bonus awards for those who level up beyond level 50. Sounds lootcratetive.

Boris Johnson is visiting Sunderland, where, and in an interview for broadcasters he said that some “extra precautions” may be needed after 19 July, the date set for England to reach step 4 of the roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions.The government has always said that at step 4 it hopes to remove all remaining legal restrictions on social contact.But this has never been a firm commitment, and there has been speculation that some measures will have to remain in place.Asked if the country would return to total normality after 19 July, with all restrictions gone, rather than a “neutered version of real life”, Johnson replied:I know how impatient people are to get back to total normality, as indeed am I.I will be setting in the course of the next few days what step four will look like exactly.But I think I’ve said it before, we’ll be wanting to go back to a world that is as close to the status quo ante Covid as possible, try to get back to life as close to it was before Covid.But there may be some things we have to do, extra precautions that we have to take, but I’ll be setting them out.He also insisted that the country was now “in the final furlong” on the route to opening up. He said.I know that people are impatient for us to open up faster, and of course I want to do that, but what I’m saying to people is we’re now in the final furlong, I really believe. We have to look very carefully at the data and at the moment of what we’re certainly seeing is a big increasing in cases, 26,000 as you will have seen, but that is not translating into a big increase in serious illness, and death.And so it looks ever clearer that the vaccination programme, the speed of that vaccine rollout, has broken that link between infection and mortality. And that’s an amazing thing that gives us the scope, we think on the 19, to go ahead cautiously, irreversibly [with opening up].Prof Calum Semple, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, told BBC Breakfast this morning that the official list of Covid symptoms should be expanded.As PA Media reports, he said fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea should be added to the list to catch diagnoses of the virus earlier, as those symptoms are particularly prevalent in people in their 20s and 30s. He said:As older people are vaccinated, proportionally more younger people are having disease and they have a different group of symptoms.By extending the symptom list, we think we’ll pick up about a third more cases. But, more importantly, we’ll pick them up a day earlier and that offers greater opportunity to break transmission chains and stop further spread of the virus.In his Mansion House speech this morning Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, suggested the government has given up on trying to negotiate post-Brexit equivalence agreements for financial services with the EU.The full text of the speech is here.And my colleague Graeme Wearden has been covering the speech, and the reaction, on his business live blog.And this is from Ryan Stephenson, the Conservative candidate in Batley and Spen.This is from Kim Leadbeater, the Labour candidate for Batley and Spen.On his first proper day as DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has seen one of his MLAs (member of the legislative assembly) resign from the party. Alex Easton said he was quitting because he could no longer tolerate DUP infighting. He said:It is with great sadness and hurt that I find myself doing one of the hardest things in my life and resigning from the DUP.I have had to stand back and watch as colleagues tear themselves apart, brief against other colleagues and run to the media in order to hurt each other on a daily basis. There is no respect, discipline or decency, I have just had enough.This is not something that I want to be a part of as a unionist - it is not Alex Easton. No matter who people supported during the recent leadership contest, I find elements from both sides are equally to blame for recent events, and it continues.George Galloway has released a video saying he is hoping for a really big victory tonight in Batley and Spen. He also says that, by briefing the media that it expected to lose (he was referring to this report by my colleague Heather Stewart), the party had “knocked the stuffing” out of its own campaign.Galloway used to be a Labour MP until he was thrown out of the party in 2003 because of . In Batley and Spen he is standing as a candidate for the Workers party, which he founded himself. He says that if he were to win, that would be “the biggest shock in British political history”. But in fact it would not be such a shock because Galloway specialises in capturing Labour seats in places where a biggish Muslim population means there is a lot of support for his strongly pro-Palestinian views and he has done it twice before already: in Bethnal Green and Bow, which he won in the 2005 general election, overturning a Labour majority of more than 10,000; and in Bradford West, which he won in a byelection in 2012, overturning a Labour majority of almost 6,000.The Survation poll in Batley and Spen had Galloway on just 6%, well behind the Tories and Labour. But, in his Politico’s Alex Wickham thinks a Galloway victory is not impossible. Wickham writes:Those up in Batley say Galloway does appear to have significant backing, with large numbers of households across the constituency displaying posters in their windows bearing his name. Galloway’s ground operation is also said to be effective, as is his messaging on the doorstep urging people in the strongest possible terms not to vote for Starmer’s Labour ... Playbook has heard from more than one person in both the Tories and the Labour party that it isn’t impossible that Galloway wins the seat himself.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been giving a speech this morning following his confirmation as the new DUP leader last night. The full text is here, and here are some of the key points.The Northern Ireland protocol represents the greatest threat to the economic integrity of the United Kingdom in any of our lifetimes.The Irish Sea border is not just a threat to the economic integrity of the United Kingdom; it is a threat to the living standards of the people of Northern Ireland and the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.In the weeks ahead our goal is to remove the Irish Sea border and to preserve and protect the internal UK market.He said that he would be pressing the government constantly on this issue, that the current situation was “unsustainable and unacceptable” and that there was “still some way to go to reach an outcome that we can live with”.Let me also make it clear that if the government stands over its commitments, we will not be found wanting in delivering on ours.The New Decade, New Approach Agreement, for all of its flaws, was the basis for the restoration of Stormont in 2020 and it remains so today.When we should have been focussed on the needs of wider society, we have been consumed with the internal politics of the party.At times, I know we have strained the patience not just of the public but of our own supporters as well.As the new leader of the DUP, I want to apologise to our supporters and to the public for that.For me unionism should have no barriers to entry beyond a belief that Northern Ireland is best served as a part of the UK.While I celebrate the past and our many achievements, my unionism does not hanker on returning back to a bygone age but forward to a new era.It is defined by what we are for, not what we are against. And it is not limited to the boundaries of Northern Ireland but includes the whole of our United Kingdom.A 42-metre replica of London’s iconic Big Ben clocktower has been unveiled in Manchester city centre, PA Media reports. PA says:The art installation, Big Ben Lying Down With Political Books, in Piccadilly Gardens marks the start of the Manchester International Festival, which runs until 18 July.Some 20,000 books will be attached to the exterior of the ‘Big Ben of the North’ and will be given away for free at the end of the festival.The oldest book included is Common Sense by Thomas Paine, published in 1776, and the most recent is footballer Marcus Rashford’s You Are A Champion: Unlock Your Potential, Find Your Voice And Be The Best You Can Be, released this year.The installation is the first major UK commission for renowned Argentinian artist Marta Minujin, who said: “Things need to change, global symbols like Big Ben stand up straight and never change but the world is always changing.“The UK is now living through Covid and Brexit - things are never ‘straight’, we need to be able to adapt and be flexible with our ideas. This will be a new national symbol, one that the people of Manchester will create.”Forty eight Conservative MPs have written to Boris Johnson to demand schools “go back to normal” from 19 July, when the remaining restrictions in England are due to be lifted.In their letter they say that it is “vital that all schools go back to normal from July 19 when restrictions lift, even if just for the last few days of term”. They go on:This will send an important signal ahead of the autumn that the route to freedom is a ‘one way road’ and genuinely ‘irreversible’.The signatories include Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former party leader, Esther McVey, another former cabinet minister, and Robert Halfon, the chair of the Commons education committee.For many schools in England term is due to end in the week starting Monday 19 July.Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, has tweeted her support for Kim Leadbeater, the party’s candidate in the Batley and Spen byelection.The Office for National Statistics has published It reflects responses given by people in a survey, rather than information about what doctors have diagnosed. Here are the key points.As my colleague Graeme Wearden reports on his business live blog, Nissan has unveiled plans for the UK’s first “gigafactory” producing batteries for electric vehicles, in a £1bn investment plan that secures the future of its Sunderland car plant.In an interview Ashwani Gupta, Nissan’s chief operating officer, refused to say how much the UK government had contributed to allow the project to go ahead.In an interview on the Today programme Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, also refused to disclose the size of the government subsidy involved. He said:You will know we’re in conversations with lots of auto companies, there are lots of companies that are interested in investing in the UK, and it would be completely irresponsible for me to go into matters that are commercially sensitive.Asked if he could confirm that the sum was significant, he replied: It’s no secret that, across the world, governments are seeking to attract what is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. So that’s widely understood, and the British government has been involved in conversations of that kind.But the billion pounds [Nissan are] giving far outweighs and is far in excess of the amount of support that we have provided.Good morning. In Batley and Spen voters have started going to the polls in a byelection that has become a crucial test for Sir Keir Starmer. It is not certain the party will lose, but many Labour figures think that this is highly likely, and if that does happen, it will trigger an intense debate about the extent to which Starmer’s leadership is responsible (or accelerate it - because that debate has already begun.) A Survation poll in June had the Conservatives on course to come first in Batley and Spen by six points; if they do win, it would mean the governing party has gained a seat from the opposition twice in byelections within two months - a feat which would be unprecedented in modern times.The prospect of a Labour defeat has already prompted a lot of chatter about a possible leadership challenge, and today the Times (paywall) has a story saying Angela Rayner’s supporters are on manoeuvres. It says:Supporters of Angela Rayner are preparing for her to challenge Sir Keir Starmer’s leadership of Labour if the party loses the by-election in Batley & Spen today.MPs close to the deputy leader have been canvassing support among parliamentary colleagues and trade unions, The Times has learnt. Allies of Starmer are braced for an unprecedented leadership contest from his deputy.Senior figures at Unite, Labour’s biggest union backer, are willing to support a challenge but they have not discussed the idea with her directly and she has not told them she wants the job.Last night Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, put out a tweet denying that she was involved. Here is my colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson’s latest report from the constituency.And here is a story with an overview of what’s happening there today.Here is the agenda for the day.9.20am: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, delivers a speech at the Mansion House.9.30am: The ONS publishes new figures on Covid in schools, on long Covid, and on the economic impact of the pandemic.12pm: Downing Street is due to hold its daily lobby briefing.12.30pm: Leading child health experts speak at a Royal Society of Medicine online seminar on vaccinating children.2pm: Public Health England publishes its weekly Covid surveillance report.Also, at some point today the Northern Ireland executive is due to meet to consider further easing of Covid restrictions.Politics Live has been a mix of Covid and non-Covid news recently and that is likely to be the case today.

For some time now, high-profile artists have criticised the government over its lack of support for those who tour on the continent.Since the Brexit deal was finalised last year, there have been  that the rules around working visas after the UK's departure from the European Union have made it more difficult to perform in those countries.Visa-free travel for creatives is no longer guaranteed for musicians and performers when travelling to EU members.What are the potential problems?The lack of visa-free travel could make it more cumbersome to obtain the licenses and permissions needed to perform in the EU.Performers, crew and staff would all need to apply for permission to work in the places where they perform, and it could mean an increase in fees, depending on the rules each country has in place.There could also be additional restrictions for any equipment that needs to be transported, or filming that may want to be done.And permission would not necessarily be granted to those seeking it either.Before leaving the EU, freedom of movement rules meant that performers were able to mount gigs and concerts, largely unencumbered by these rules.For less established artists, it could mean the chance to perform in European countries is taken away from them, with the benefits being outweighed by the new barriers.There are also likely restrictions and rules for artists from the European Union coming to perform in the UK.The exact costs and amount of permissions will likely vary by country, but unions and artists certainly foresee additional red tape and significant costs going forward.What are performers saying?The industry has accused the government of failing to negotiate new rules on its behalf.Leading the charge is Sir Elton John, who has warned of a ""looming catastrophe"" because of the new restrictions.He told the Observer he was ""livid about what the government did when Brexit happened.""Sir Elton added: ""They made no provision for the entertainment business, and not just for musicians, actors and film directors, but for the crews, the dancers, the people who earn a living by going to Europe.""He had previously met with Lord Frost - the man who negotiated the Brexit deal on behalf of the government.Elsewhere, a campaign by the Musician's Union called #LetTheMusicMove has been signed by the likes of Idris Elba, Blur and Radiohead, and asks the government to help cover the costs of the new rules and deliver a long-term solution to avoid fees and red tape.As well as that, Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson, who voted Leave in the EU Referendum, has said that he isn't a fan of the government's approach to the situation, telling Sky News: ""At the moment, all this guff about not being able to play in Europe, and the Europeans not being able to play over here and work permits and all the rest of the rubbish - come on - get your act together.""What is the government saying?Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, has previously said that visa-free touring was now possible, in some form, in 17 countries in the EU.Lord Frost told a committee of MPs that solving the problem is a ""major priority"" for the government, adding it was hoping to deliver some good news on the prospect of EU touring later this year.Both Brussels and Westminster have blamed each other for the issues, each saying the other side rejected its proposals.Since the UK left the EU, musicians & crew-members now have to face numerous financial & bureaucratic hurdles to continue touring in the EU.  We're supporting a campaign to #LetTheMusicMove & keep pressure on the government. Have a scroll through some facts & feel free to share. A government spokesperson has previously said: ""We want performers and other creative professionals to be able to tour easily abroad.""Short-term, temporary visits for paid performances by UK performers are possible in at least 17 EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, without needing visas or work permits.""However, we recognise the difficulties still being faced by the sector.""That is why we are working closely with individual member states to encourage them to adopt a more flexible approach, in line with the UK's own rules which allow creative professionals to tour easily here.""",https://e3.365dm.com/21/06/768x432/skynews-concert-brexit_5432712.jpg?20210630162917,"Andy Murray thanks two fans who cheered him to Wimbledon victory – by giving them his shirt - The Telegraph
Sir Andy Murray gave two of his fans the night of their lives on Centre Court as he thanked them for .Murray singled out a group of fans in the bottom row for helping him keep the faith after he dropped two sets to set up a nail-biting finale.During the match, Murray could be seen shouting at the group as he tried to pump himself up inside a rocking Centre Court.After his win, he walked over to thank two of them - handing Justin Rodrigues, 33, a South African accountant in a Scotland rugby shirt, his own playing jersey for the match.He also gave Rodrigues’s friend, Glenn Chambers, his umbrella. Rodrigues, who has Scottish heritage through his mother, said the bond with his hero had been formed midway through the match.“I think we just connected the whole match,” he said, explaining how Murray regularly made eye contact with him. “I was just shouting at him ‘Come on, Andy’, ‘Come on, Andy’, and we just connected.“I had a Scottish rugby jersey on and he saw that. Me and my friend (Glenn) were just eyeballing him. It was only probably from the third set onwards, but from there onwards, he was just looking at us.“After the game he came and gave me the shirt and he gave my friend the umbrella and he just said 'thanks'. It's the best thing that could have ever happened to me.“My mother is the biggest Andy Murray fan in the whole world. She's Scottish, and she absolutely adores him and I adore him as well, but not nearly as much as my mother, but a close second.”Rodrigues, who moved to nearby Earlsfield with his wife five years ago, said it had been one of the best nights of his life.“We just managed to get through the All England club online,” he added. “It was luck of the draw - we managed to roll the dice. It was amazing.  I've shed tears with Murray over the years,  when he won his Wimbledon, when he won his gold medal - I'm just the biggest fan.”Friend Glenn added: “Andy just picked up a few people in the crowd and he just fed off the energy.”Britain's two-time Wimbledon champion eventually secured victory against the German Oscar Otte, with a glorious winning lob that defied his advancing years.Unreal atmosphere out there tonight… thanks so much to everyone that was in there watching and supporting.. you carried me over the line 👏 life in the old dog yet eh!🐕Murray, who has not featured in the singles for four years due to career-threatening injury, struggled with the slippery conditions that have become a talking point this week, but said afterwards he picked the fans in the crowd to feed off when he lost a point. “I was basically staring at them after each point and engaging with them,” he added. “We were feeding off each other. I know what a great atmosphere is in tennis and that was definitely one of them.”We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Visit our adblocking instructions
