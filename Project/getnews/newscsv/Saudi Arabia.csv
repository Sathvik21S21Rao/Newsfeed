"Timely 3-pointers in 4th quarter by Phoenix Suns' Devin Booker 'melted' Milwaukee Bucks in Game 2 win - ESPN
PHOENIX -- With the Milwaukee Bucks breathing down the Phoenix Suns' necks on Thursday, threatening to erase a once 15-point lead and head back home with a series split, the Suns relied on the guy who ticks off Chris Paul when he doesn't do precisely what he did in the fourth quarter of Game 2 of the NBA Finals.Shoot. And shoot some more.Devin Booker scored nine of his team-high 31 points in the final frame, hitting a trio of timely triples to stave off the Bucks' comeback attempt. The Suns had a historic night as a team from beyond the arc in the 118-108 win.""Those are the moments that he lives for,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said of Booker. ""Doesn't run from it. ... He just steps up and makes big plays.""The Bucks started the fourth quarter on a 6-2 spurt to cut the Suns' lead to six when Booker, with the 7-foot Brook Lopez flailing a hand in his face, sunk a sidestep 3 to push the lead back to nine with 9:41 remaining.A couple minutes later, after Milwaukee had pulled within seven, he hit back-to-back 3s in the span of 31 seconds to balloon the lead up to 13, sending the crowd into a frenzy.And it led to the Bucks staring down a 2-0 series hole.""Every time Book hit a 3 or did something, you could just tell it just melted them down,"" Suns guard Mikal Bridges, who scored 27, said of Milwaukee. ""[They were thinking] like, 'Dang, we was right there.'""It was Booker's eighth game with 30-plus points in these playoffs out of the 18 games Phoenix has played on its way to the championship round. His 490 total points this postseason rank third all time for a player competing in his first playoffs, according to ESPN Stats & Information research, trailing only Rick Barry (521) and Julius Erving (518).""The thing about Devin, he shoots the same way first quarter, fourth quarter, doesn't matter, his shot looks the same,"" Williams said. ""That's a guy that's put a ton of work in his shot, but the mentality, he's calm in those moments. So, we're grateful for those contributions in those moments.""Paul, who complemented Booker's offensive outburst with 23 points and eight assists of his own, was a little more pointed with the bar he has set for his 24-year-old teammate.""If Book shoots it, I expect it to go in,"" Paul said. ""I get mad at him when he don't shoot.""Booker finished 7-of-12 from 3 on a night his team went 20-for-40, tying the record for second-most 3s ever made in a Finals game.""I mean, the guys work on it,"" Williams said of his group's output. ""We have a let-it-fly mentality.""But while teammates marveled at his play -- ""He's not going to run from any fight, battle, situation that the basketball court presents,"" Jae Crowder said -- Booker gave the credit right back to those with whom he shares the court.""That's just team,"" Booker said. ""Team basketball. I think a few of [the shots] were open, and we prepared for these moments.""For Paul, who is within reach of the title he has been chasing for 16 years, he said he has appreciated pairing with Booker in that pursuit.""He just stays in attack mode all game long,"" Paul said. ""And that's what I love about him.""",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Padres' Daniel Camarena enters MLB history books with improbable grand slam - Fox News

Talk about a rough couple of days.After Canadiens forward Brendan Gallagher Wednesday night in Tampa, he said he came home and found out his house was robbed.“When your Stanley Cup dreams are crushed and you come home to find out you’ve been robbed but it’s okay,”  in a video that featured him eating a sandwich and listening to a Pitbull song. “Because pit bull has been there and done that.”The Canadiens flew to Tampa on Tuesday, so the alleged robbery could have been committed at any time since then. Gallagher did not say which items were missing from his home or provide any additional details.Montreal fans were devastated for the 2010 fifth-round pick, who has emerged as a fan-favorite during his nine-year career with the franchise.“I just want to give Brendan Gallagher a hug. He deserves one,” . on how to find whoever robbed the 5-foot-9 forward: “Guys. Just look for the person in Montreal wearing Canadiens merchandise this is three sizes too small and there, you found the person who robbed Brendan Gallagher. It’s really not that hard.”The 29-year-old has taken HabsTV on viewings of his homes in the past. His Montreal crib featured a California king bed and a beautiful bathtub – “I actually do take baths,” the forward said on the tour. His summer home in Tsawwassen, British Columbia featured a WWE championship belt, cowboy hats and a memorabilia collection.It is not clear which of his residences was allegedly robbed, although it was more likely his home in Montreal given the season just ended. But nonetheless, it is a tough blow for Gallagher, who was three wins short of winning the Stanley Cup.“I take nothing out of moral victories,” Gallagher said after losing Game 5 to the Lightning. “At the start of the year when we sat down as a group, our goal was to be here, we expected to be here. Regardless of what people thought of our team, expectations were to win this series.”Share SelectionTHE BEST INSIGHTS FROM THE ULTIMATE INSIDERS

"How New Biden Rules Could Make It Easier To Buy Hearing Aids Or Fix Your Phone - NPR

President Biden is set to unveil a new plan on Friday taking aim at powerful industries where a handful of players have so much market clout that they can drive up prices, depress wages and make it hard for small companies to break in.His executive order on competition contains directives for a dozen government agencies to take 72 measures — some big, some small — to shake up key markets for consumers, workers, farmers and small businesses, White House officials told NPR. They spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of Biden's announcement.The White House is just getting started on what it hopes will be a new era of enforcement of antitrust laws in which mergers are challenged more often and unfair practices are cracked down on, the officials said.News about some of the measures trickled out earlier this week, including a plan to and pare back unnecessary licensing requirements for jobs.The executive order also includes plans to allow hearing aids to be sold over the counter at pharmacies and to , according to information viewed by NPR ahead of the announcement.Some of the rules pick up where competition advocates in the Obama administration left off.""We started this effort in our last year, and it took awhile to even figure out what we wanted to do, and then it takes a long time to write a rule or to make sure you're enforcing a rule,"" said Jason Furman, who led the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama White House.""We got a good start, but it was only a start,"" said Furman, now a professor of economic policy at Harvard. ""What's really important here is that President Biden is doing this in his first year.""Some of the most sweeping measures target the tech sector. The White House wants Obama-era net neutrality rules to be restored — measures that prevent internet providers from throttling their service.Other measures would make it easier to compare prices for internet services, ban steep early termination bills, and stop landlords from having exclusive arrangements with providers.The White House is expected to signal that it will scrutinize mergers in the tech sector, particularly when established players buy up new competitors and deals that affect the privacy of consumers and their data.Details and enforcement of many of these directives would fall to the , a high-profile critic of big technology companies.But the White House will also urge the FTC to focus on competition in the health care sector, including a ban on deals where pharmaceutical drugmakers pay to delay the release of generic drugs.Biden also will create a new competition council at the White House to track progress on the 72 ideas and come up with new measures to add to the list.That systematic approach should pay dividends, Furman said. He explained that a series of small and medium measures can add up to big changes.For example, he said, hearing aids — an expensive market dominated by a few players — is one area ripe for competition. The Obama administration tried to make it possible to buy more types of hearing aids at pharmacies, just like reading glasses, rather than treating them like expensive medical devices.""That won't transform our economy,"" Furman said, ""but for a lot of people, that'll save them thousands of dollars. And that's the type of action you want to do over and over again.""",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/05/07/the-npr-politics-podcast_final_sq-ecdd1508be24f14c6b6ee98e6627cbf2be192ea6-s800-c15.jpg,"Wells Fargo shuts down personal lines of credit – will your credit score be hurt? - WRAL Tech Wire
by Allison Morrow and Matt Egan, CNN Business — July 9, 2021 .Wells Fargo is shutting down all of its existing personal lines of credit, sparking outrage from consumers and advocates.A spokesperson for the bank said Wells Fargo made the decision last year as part of an effort to simplify its product offerings. The bank feels it can better meet borrowing needs through credit cards and personal loans, the spokesperson said.The popular consumer lending product that the bank is shuttering typically lets users borrow up to $100,000, according to CNBC, which reported the news earlier Thursday. The product was advertised to consumers as a way to consolidate higher-interest credit card debt or pay for home renovations.In notices to customers about the closure, the bank warned that the change could impact their credit scores.Wells Fargo was trending on Twitter Thursday night following CNBC’s report, with consumer advocates, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, expressing outrage.“Not a single @WellsFargo customer should see their credit score suffer just because their bank is restructuring after years of scams and incompetence. Sending out a warning notice simply isn’t good enough — Wells Fargo needs to make this right.”The news comes more than four years after a scandal erupted in which the bank admitted to opening millions of fake accounts, as well as forcing customers to pay for unneeded auto insurance or charging unnecessary mortgage fees. The Federal Reserve called it “widespread customer abuse,” and in 2018 the central bank imposed a cap on Wells Fargo’s assets — essentially barring the it from increasing its balance sheet until it addresses the compliance failures that led to the scandal.",https://www.wraltechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wells-fargo-branch-1280x575.jpg,"Stocks making the biggest moves in the premarket: Levi, General Motors, American Airlines and more - CNBC

"LISTING OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRESS RELEASES - Los Angeles County

			The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) confirms a 165% increase of new cases over last week with 839 new cases of COVID-19.     
   The County’s daily average case rate is now 3.5 cases per 100,000 people, an increase from last week’s rate of 1.74 cases per 100,000.      
   Today’s daily test positivity rate is 2.5%, also an increase from last week’s rate of 1.2%.       
With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   The County’s daily average case rate is now 3.5 cases per 100,000 people, an increase from last week’s rate of 1.74 cases per 100,000.      
   Today’s daily test positivity rate is 2.5%, also an increase from last week’s rate of 1.2%.       
With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   Today’s daily test positivity rate is 2.5%, also an increase from last week’s rate of 1.2%.       
With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine has been pitched with one major advantage over its counterparts since it was authorized for use: It requires just one dose. But with the exponential spread of the highly transmissible delta variant, questions have arisen over whether recipients might need to ""top off"" their immunity against the now-dominant strain in the U.S. with a second shot.Although the J&J vaccine's efficacy at protecting against symptomatic COVID-19 in clinical trials was less than the two-dose mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, it showed 100% effectiveness .Recent research suggests that mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer and Moderna, appear to hold up against the delta variant as long as you've been fully vaccinated with two doses.Pfizer reported Thursday that  six to 12 months after being fully vaccinated, may give more protection and promised to have data to publish in the coming week to ask the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend a third dose.Johnson and Johnson has put out its own data suggesting that their single dose also holds up against the dominant variant, but it was a small study and people are thinking more is more.The promising preliminary data suggests that the J&J vaccine offers good protection against the delta variant.In a laboratory experiment, researchers analyzed the blood of 10 people who had been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and tested it against multiple concerning variants, including delta.They found the vaccine appeared to work against the variants, shown by ""neutralizing antibody titers"" and other immune system response indicators.What level immune response is required to achieve protection is still open science, but the experiment offered promising clues, if not definitive proof of real-world protection.The news offers some measure of reassurance for the more than 12 million Americans who have received the J&J vaccine; it's also prompting some medical experts to reevaluate what role a ""booster"" shot might have -- whether it'll still be needed, and if so, when, and for whom.""The new data does in fact change my opinion,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist from Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News medical contributor. ""We try as much as possible to stick to the science when it comes to vaccine strategy, and overall this is really encouraging news.""All vaccines available in the U.S. have so far shown to be both safe and effective for at least up to eight months. Brownstein said that receiving a booster is likely safe, and looks forward to further data. In the meantime, this new data lends some hope to those who received the J&J vaccine, that for now, they still have protection.""We want to wait for data to support any kind of vaccine strategy that we recommend,"" Brownstein said, highlighting the importance of uniform recommendations backed by data.The science has yet to be settled, experts say.""I think there are still open questions for those who are immunocompromised,"" Brownstein said. ""Talk to your doctor -- especially if you're in the high-risk category.""Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, explained that ""when talking about people who are immunocompromised, that includes a large spectrum of disease, and there are no studies at the present time to indicate that an additional dose will benefit you or what sort of reactions you might get from an additional dose.""For now, Schaffner firmly stands against the idea of an additional booster shot without formal recommendations. He emphasized that the CDC is yet to recommend any booster, under any circumstances at the present time.""People are making these recommendations on the basis of hope: hope that it would work and hope there wouldn't be any adverse events. But there certainly has been no formal study to support it at this time,"" Schaffner added.""Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,"" the agencies said in the statement Thursday. ""FDA, CDC, and NIH (National Institutes of Health) are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary.""While many experts remain split on the issue of boosters, it's not for lack of confidence in the single-shot vaccine doing its job. Dr. Vin Gupta, a critical care pulmonologist and faculty at University of Wisconsin Medicine, said an added booster shot on top of the single J&J vaccine would essentially be an additional layer of protection.Gupta advocated for a booster not because he thinks the J&J shot doesn't work well, but rather, to ensure level protection for all vaccines across the board. He stands by that stance.""The idea is, if we are going to have one uniform set of policies, everyone should be entitled to the same level of immunity and effective vaccines,"" Gupta said. ""The point is a booster with mRNA doesn't appear to be harmful and bringing everyone to the same level of immunity should be our goal.""Dr. Stephanie Widmer, an emergency medicine physician and medical toxicology fellow in New York, is a contributor to the ABC News Medical Unit.",https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/covid-2-gty-er-210512_1620862851082_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg,"Lead Sinovac vaccine scientist in Indonesia dies of suspected COVID-19, media say - Yahoo News
By Stanley Widianto and Bernadette Christina(Reuters) - The lead scientist on China's Sinovac vaccine trials in Indonesia died of suspected COVID-19 on Wednesday, Indonesian media said.The death of Novilia Sjafri Bachtiar comes as fatalities from the coronavirus reach record highs in Indonesia, one of the countries where the Sinovac vaccine has been most widely used.Kumparan news service said Novilia had died of the coronavirus. Sindonews quoted an official of state-owned pharmaceuticals company BioFarma as saying she had been buried according to COVID-19 protocols.State enterprises minister Erick Thohir posted a message on Instagram mourning her ""huge loss"" at BioFarma, which is making the vaccine. He did not give the cause of her death.""She was lead scientist and head of dozens of clinical trials done by BioFarma, including COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in cooperation with Sinovac,"" he said.""It has been produced and injected into tens of millions people in Indonesia, as part of our effort to be free from this COVID-19 pandemic.""BioFarma did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the death of Novilia, who was in her early fifties.The infection and deaths of health workers in Indonesia who had received the Sinovac vaccine has added to questions over its effectiveness in preventing hospitalisation and death.According to independent data group Lapor COVID-19, 131 healthcare workers, mostly vaccinated with the Sinovac shot, have died since June, including 50 in July.Indonesia reported more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths in a day for the first time on Wednesday and a record 34,379 infections. The latest wave of infections has been driven by the Delta variant, first identified in India.Last month, Sinovac spokesman Liu Peicheng told Reuters preliminary results showed the vaccine produced a three-fold reduction in neutralizing effect against the Delta variant.(Writing by Matthew Tostevin; Editing by Nick Macfie)",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"5 areas with low COVID vaccine rates put U.S. at risk from Delta variant and further mutations, experts say - CBS News
Five under-vaccinated regions of the U.S. could be putting the entire nation at risk, according to researchers at Georgetown University. The fear is COVID-19 could mutate so significantly in these areas, it could defeat vaccines.An analysis by Georgetown University researchers found five significant clusters in the southern and lower Midwestern part of the U.S. They include portions of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and New Mexico. The Biden administration is sounding the alarm about a rapid rise in the Delta variant, which is significantly more widespread than previously thought. ""To be clear, there will likely continue to be an increase in cases among unvaccinated Americans,"" said White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients. A study published in the journal Nature on Thursday suggests that having only one dose of a vaccine offers little protection against the Delta variant. There are 25 million people in the U.S. who have received only one shot, and 140 million are unvaccinated, leaving 45% of the country at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In Missouri, the Delta variant accounts for 73% of new COVID cases, according to the CDC. In Texas, a youth camp near Austin may be the nation's latest super-spreader event. More than 100 cases have been confirmed, and officials fear the number may eventually top 200.""We believe that this is an outbreak of the Delta variant,"" said Dr. Philip Keiser, Galveston County's local health authority. At Houston Methodist Hospital, the Delta variant is responsible for 42% of new cases. The hospital expects the Delta variant to make up 90% of its cases in the next two to three weeks. ""The majority of patients that we are seeing hospitalized with COVID-19 with the Delta variant, the vast, vast majority of those patients are unvaccinated,"" said Dr. Wesley Long, the director of medical microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said those who are most vulnerable and live in low vaccination areas should take precautions.""If you are an elderly person or if you have a person with an underlying disease, you might want to go the extra mile of protection of wearing a mask if you are indoors,"" he said Thursday. ",https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/07/09/d938faba-e0f8-4244-b4c2-005515c06803/thumbnail/620x349/207245fbbfdd065549156cf03a4e2dc6/clusters-undervaccinated-portions-us-labels.jpg#
"‘Stillwater’: Matt Damon Tears Up During Standing Ovation At Palais Premiere – Cannes - Deadline
In town for the world premiere of out-of-competition Cannes Film Festival entry Stillwater, star Matt Damon appeared moved by emotion during a near-five-minute standing ovation tonight. The drama, directed by Spotlight Oscar-winner Tom McCarthy, brought the assembled crowd to its feet in the Grand Théâtre Lumière as the lights came up on film’s team, and brought tears to Damon’s eyes.Stillwater centers on Damon’s Bill Baker, an Oklahoma oil-rig roughneck with a shoddy past as a father who heads to Marseille, hellbent on freeing his daughter (Abigail Breslin), an exchange student imprisoned for murdering her girlfriend, a crime she says she didn’t commit. He’s the proverbial fish out of water who finds an ally in a local single mother (Camille Cottin) and her daughter (Lilou Siauvaud). 








Given the film is largely set in Marseille, just about a two-hour drive from Cannes, the local crowd was particularly keyed in to certain references. And McCarthy further charmed the audience when he was asked to say a few words. Starting off his thank yous in French, he then added of the impromptu speech, “I didn’t prepare my French. I’m overwhelmed to be here. I have been so greatly influenced by the cinema of this country and of Europe. It has had a huge impact on my career and life. To be here is a dream come true.”The Stillwater screenplay is from McCarthy & Marcus Hinchey and Thomas Bidegain & Noé Debré. The late Steve Golin is a producer along with McCarthy, Jonathan King and Liza Chasin.Focus releases Stillwater, from Participant and DreamWorks, on July 30 domestically.",https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg,"Spice Girls Share Previously Unreleased Song “Feed Your Love”: Listen - Pitchfork

"Meet the open-source software powering NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter - Phys.org
When NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter hovered above the Red Planet April 19 on its maiden voyage, the moment was hailed as the first instance of powered, controlled flight on another planet. Figuring out how to fly on Mars, where the air is thin but gravity is about a third of that on Earth, took years of work. Along with the challenge of developing a craft that was up to the task, the mission needed software to make the unprecedented flights possible.

                                         
                                                  





So they turned to F Prime, a reusable, multi-mission flight software framework designed for CubeSats, small spacecraft, and instruments. The program was initially developed in 2013 by a team led by Tim Canham at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California with the aim of creating a low-cost, portable, pliable software architecture option that would allow components written for one application to be reused easily in other applications and run on a range of processors.
In 2017, the team pushed for F Prime to be released as open-source, meaning anyone could freely access the software's source code, allowing external collaborators, universities, and the general public to use the framework on their own projects. It is one of hundreds of codes NASA makes available to the public for free, both as open-source or through its software catalog.
""F Prime has enabled a lot of goals we've had at JPL to design a truly reusable multi-mission flight architecture with the added bonus of the open-source collaboration and visibility afforded by the Mars Helicopter project,"" Canham said. ""It's kind of an open-source victory, because we're flying an open-source operating system and an open-source flight software framework, and flying commercial parts that you can buy off the shelf, if you wanted to do this yourself someday."" (The helicopter carries a combination of custom-made and off-the-shelf components—many from the world of cell phone technology—including its two cameras.)

Frame rate is 3.3 frames per second until Ingenuity began its final descent to the surface, at which point it collected a frame every two seconds. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech
Before Ingenuity, F Prime (also written as F') had already been put through its spacecraft paces, operating successfully aboard the ISS RapidScat scatterometer instrument on the International Space Station since 2014 and JPL's ASTERIA CubeSat in 2017. Looking forward, F Prime is scheduled to run on projects including NASA's Lunar Flashlight CubeSat, which will look for surface ice in the Moon's craters; the agency's Near-Earth Asteroid Scout CubeSat, which will map an asteroid; and potentially JPL's Ocean Worlds Life Surveyor instrument, which would help search for water-based life in our solar system.






Aadil Rizvi, flight software lead for Lunar Flashlight and NEA Scout at JPL, says F Prime provides an out-of-the-box solution for several flight software services, such as commanding, telemetry, parameters, and sequencing for the spacecraft. There's also a sort of ""auto-coding"" tool that makes F Prime highly portable for use across missions.
""This makes it quite easy to drop in a software component from something like Mars Helicopter into another mission's flight software such as Lunar Flashlight or make the component available for open-source use by anyone else using F Prime,"" Rizvi said. ""And it's pretty cool that a significant portion of software used on the Mars Helicopter is identical to software on another spacecraft going to the Moon, or an asteroid, or sitting on a student's desk.""
Universities See the Benefits of F Prime
Since its open-source debut, F Prime has gradually begun gaining traction as a useful flight software option for university and student projects.
At Georgia Tech, a team has incorporated F Prime in its GT1 CubeSat, aimed to serve as an education exercise that will carry an interactive and automatic amateur radio payload.
""We chose F Prime after evaluating a handful of flight software frameworks, including the option of writing our own from scratch,"" said Sterling Peet, Georgia Tech research faculty member and software lead for GT1. ""We don't have the resources to build all this code from scratch, use, and test it to ensure the necessary levels of reliability in-house. But by using F Prime, we can leverage the legacy it has and also contribute our testing and related benefits back to the F Prime community and project.""
A Carnegie Mellon University student-led team chose F Prime to run its Iris Lunar Rover, a tiny robot designed to prove the feasibility of nano-rovers in planetary exploration. ""It was a viable option with a direct link to the creators, so we decided to use it ourselves,"" said Iris Deputy Program Manager Raewyn Duvall.
F Prime will control the rover while recording data and monitoring its health.
""The fact that it is open-source gave us a wide range of examples to base our own modules and let us use the forum to get quick answers without having to worry about potential support service charges just to get answers to questions we may have had,"" Duvall said.
JPL Small Scale Flight Software Group Supervisor Jeff Levison sees university partnerships like the ones with Georgia Tech and Carnegie Mellon as a two-way street: JPL provides world-leading flight systems expertise to budding engineers, and then down the line, those future engineers could end up bringing their talents and a working understanding of F Prime to start a career at JPL.
""F Prime is not an easy architecture to pick up, so a student who manages to master it and create a solid working project clearly has amazing potential for an organization like JPL,"" said Carnegie Mellon's Duvall. ""Many of our students working on Iris that learned F Prime have expressed interest in applying to JPL, which I believe proves F Prime's worth as a recruitment tool.""

Large satellites used for TV broadcasting could be quickly and easily repurposed as asteroid deflectors if a space rock were to threaten Earth, according to a study by the European aerospace company Airbus. The study, part of a mission concept called Fast Kinetic Deflection (FastKD), was commissioned by the European Space Agency (ESA), as part of its effort to prepare for an apocalyptic scenario that will certainly happen one day (even though that day might be in a very distant future).Telecommunication satellites that sit in the so-called geostationary orbit at the altitude of 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) circle Earth at a speed that matches the rotation of the planet, thus appearing permanently suspended above a certain region. These satellites are usually very large, like a small bus. They might weigh 4 to 6 tons, which would give them enough force to affect the trajectory of an approaching space rock. Still, as Albert Falke, who led the FastKD study at Airbus, told Space.com, it would require maybe 10 such spacecraft hitting a 1,000-foot-wide (300 meters) asteroid within a short period of time to sufficiently change its trajectory to avoid the planet. Related: ""These telecommunication platforms, in addition to being large and heavy, are also built with quite a high frequency,"" Falke said. ""That means we can expect them to be available readily in the integration facilities [of satellite manufacturers]. That's something we can take for granted.""In 2019, for example, 15 geostationary satellites were ordered by commercial satellite operators worldwide, according to SpaceNews.In the scenario explored by Airbus, if astronomers detect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, all satellite manufacturers around the world will have to start converting the telecoms satellites they are currently building into anti-asteroid weapons. All of these missions would have to launch within about one month to reach the asteroid at about the same time.The combined effect of the satellites crashing into the Earthbound rock may change its trajectory by only an inch or two, but that would be enough to nudge it off course and prevent a disaster if done long enough before the expected impact. ""The bottleneck [for the success of such a mission] will be the rockets,"" Falke said. ""We think we could expect about 10 to 15 launches available within one month around the entire globe.""Airbus chose available technology instead of building a new spacecraft completely from scratch for one simple reason: Astronomers may only spot an not that long in advance. The deflection mission might take anywhere between six to 18 months to reach its target, which might leave only about six months for the engineers to make the craft ready. "" has very much improved over the last decades,"" Falke said. ""There are huge observation programs, mostly pushed by NASA. So all the big asteroids, 1 km (0.6 miles) in size and larger should be known. But of course, there are some which could not be observed in the past because their orbits are six to eight years, and their last close approach may have been before these telescopes were put in place,"" he added.It is theoretically possible for a threatening asteroid to be spotted tomorrow, with only months left before a devastating encounter with Earth, Falke added. Some smaller bodies, such as the 2013 Chelyabinsk asteroid, which triggered a shockwave that injured about 1,200 people in Russia, may arrive completely unnoticed.To be able to execute an Earth-saving mission in orbit, telecommunication satellites would have to be fitted with a special module that enables communication in deep space, as well as navigation and guidance required to approach the asteroid. These modules have yet to be developed. Ideally, they would be built and tested in advance and stand ready in case of an emergency.""We do need to have concrete plans on how to make this deflection module and put it on the telecommunications platform,"" Falke said. ""Then we need to perform very fast qualification and test activity before putting this deflection system on the launch pad.""Humankind, according to Falke, should want to be prepared. If a 1,000-foot-wide (300 m) asteroid, such as that envisioned in the Airbus study, hit somewhere in central Europe, it would cause widespread destruction across the whole continent. ""Such an impact would produce a shockwave and also firestorms and earthquakes,"" Falke said. ""A lot of material would be thrown up into the atmosphere and then come down further away from the impact zone. I think the whole of Europe would have to be evacuated and all the flora and fauna would be destroyed in the months and years after such an impact.""Falke is cautious to say whether an asteroid larger than 1,000 feet (300 m) in diameter could still be deflected using this method. But that's an important question. The asteroid that led to the  some 60 million years ago is believed to have been at least 6 miles (9.6 km) in diameter. ""If the asteroid becomes larger [than 1,000 feet], it gets more difficult,"" Falke said. ""But the good thing is that such big objects will be known a very long time in advance so we would have time to prepare.""Humankind seems to be in a better position than the dinosaurs. The world's first asteroid deflection experiment is set to take place next year when a NASA mission called DART is expected to ram into a small asteroid moon Dimorphos, which orbits a larger asteroid Didymos. The goal is to change the orbit of 520-foot-wide (160 m) Didymos with a 270-pound (600 kilograms) spacecraft.The study results were presented at the Planetary Defence Conference 2021Follow Tereza Pultarova on Twitter @TerezaPultarova.

Sea otters are a hardy lot.

                                         
                                                  





The smallest of all marine mammals with the thickest fur of the animal kingdom, they can hold their breath for up to eight minutes while they dive for prey like clams and crabs, which they're known to crack open using rocks.
An enduring mystery, however, was just how the mustelids manage to stay warm in the chilly waters of their Pacific habitat, bereft of the blubber that insulates seals, whales and walruses.
The answer, according to a new paper published in the journal Science on Thursday, is a unique energy conversion system whereby their muscle tissue ""leak"" large amounts of heat throughout their bodies.
That's unlike other mammals, which have to put their muscles to work through exercise, or involuntary shivering, to achieve the same result.
Lead author Traver Wright of Texas A&M University told AFP that while sea otters' dense, water-resistant fur offsets some heat loss, it isn't enough by itself to cope with the frigid waters off Alaska, where most of them reside.
Scientists already knew the sea otters burn a lot of energy—approximately three times greater than predicted for mammals of their size, and to keep up with the demand, they may consume up to 25 percent of their body mass in a day.





                Canadian sea otters swim on June 5, 2012 in the zoo of Amneville, eastern France.
             


It was unclear, though, which tissues were making use of this energy and how it was going towards producing heat.
To find out, Wright and colleagues took muscle samples from sea otters that were already dead, or, more happily, had been rehabilitated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and were being prepared for release.
They then used a device to measure oxygen consumption.
'Making heat by being inefficient'
The main function of muscles is generally to be able to move the body, but in the otters, much of the metabolic energy produced by breaking down sugars and fats was lost as heat instead of being used by mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, to do work such as powering muscle contraction.
This effect had been predicted for polar animals, but was observed for the first time in sea otters in the new paper.
""One of the interesting things that we found is that they're really good at making heat by being inefficient,"" said Wright.

In other words, ideal for helping maintain a body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in freezing conditions.
The team found that this ""thermogenesic"" effect was present in sea otters from the time they were babies to adults, and there was no difference in captive and wild-raised animals.
Sea otters and marine mammals more broadly might have evolved such traits when their terrestrial ancestors began taking to the oceans 50 million years ago, but that hypothesis will require more research to confirm.
Learning how sea otters' metabolic system functions differently from ours could one day also help humans solve obesity issues, added Wright.
""If you can figure out how to increase the leak and metabolic rate, you could theoretically have humans revving up the metabolism and burning off additional calories.""

Today@filipeespositoEvery day, more rumors suggest that Apple will indeed introduce new, redesigned MacBook Pro models later this year. In a new research note obtained by 9to5Mac, reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reinforces that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros will enter mass production in the third quarter of 2021.
The analyst suggests that the company is ready to start production of the next generation MacBook Pro in the coming months, which will be available in a new 14-inch and 16-inch form-factor. According to Kuo, Apple has been investing in more Mini-LED display suppliers as it plans to adopt the technology in more products, including the new MacBook Pro.Apple’s first device with a Mini-LED display was the 12.9-inch iPad Pro introduced earlier this year. For those unfamiliar, Mini-LED relies on thousands of really small LEDs in the backlight, which results in higher contrast ratios and deeper blacks, similar to OLED.Based on previous rumors (including other reports from Kuo), the new MacBook Pro will have a “flat-edged design” similar to what we’ve seen in the latest iMac, iPad Pro, and iPhone 12 designs. Apple also plans to bring back more ports to its laptop Pro, such as HDMI, SD card slot, and even MagSafe. This machine is also expected to have a more powerful M1X chip, the first evolution of Apple Silicon in Macs since M1.The MacBook Pro is not the only one that will have a Mini-LED display. Kuo’s latest report also mentions that Apple wants to adopt the same technology in the next generation MacBook Air. However, that should only be announced sometime in 2022.Earlier this week, leaker DylanDkt said that the new MacBook Air will likely be the first with an M2 chip (not the M1X, which will have a more advanced GPU focused on the Pro lineup). Dylan also heard that the new MacBook Air will be available in multiple colors, just like the new iMac. However, it’s unknown when exactly this new MacBook Air will be introduced.",https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/M1-MacBook-Pro.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1500,"Daily Deals: 25% Off Apple AirPods Pro Noise Cancelling Earbuds, Apple Back To School Sale, New Logitech Webcam, and More - IGN - IGN

Last spring, when the nation’s COVID-19 cases were soaring and tests were in short supply, some scientists wondered whether a new approach to disease surveillance might be on Americans’ wrists.One in five Americans uses a Fitbit, Apple Watch or other wearable fitness tracker. And over the past year, several studies have suggested that the devices — which can continually collect data on heart rates, body temperature, physical activity and more — could help detect early signs of COVID-19 symptoms.Now research suggests that these wearables can also help track patients’ recovery from the disease, providing insight into its long-term effects.In a paper published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, researchers studying Fitbit data reported that people who tested positive for COVID-19 displayed behavioral and physiological changes, including an elevated heart rate, that could last for weeks or months. These symptoms lasted longer in people with COVID than in those with other respiratory illnesses, the scientists found.“This was an interesting study, and I think it’s important,” said Dr. Robert Hirten, a gastroenterologist and wearables expert at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai who was not involved in the new work. “Wearable devices offer an ability for us to be able to monitor people unobtrusively over long periods of time to see, in an objective way, how really has the virus affected them?”The results are from the Digital Engagement and Tracking for Early Control and Treatment (DETECT) trial run by scientists at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. From March 25, 2020, to Jan. 24, 2021, more than 37,000 people enrolled in the trial.Participants downloaded the MyDataHelps research app and agreed to share data from their Fitbit, Apple Watch or other wearable device. They also used the app to report illness symptoms and the results of any COVID-19 tests.In October, the same researchers reported in Nature Medicine that when they combined wearable data with self-reported symptoms, they could detect COVID-19 cases more accurately than when they analyzed symptoms alone.But the data, the researchers realized, could also help them track what happened to people after the worst of the illness had passed. People recovering from COVID have reported a wide range of lasting health effects, including fatigue, “brain fog,” shortness of breath, headache, depression, heart palpitations and chest pain. (These lingering effects are often known as long COVID.)The new study focuses on a subset of 875 Fitbit-wearing participants who reported a fever, cough, body aches or other symptoms of a respiratory illness and were tested for COVID-19. Of those, 234 people tested positive for the disease. The rest were presumed to have other kinds of infections.Participants in both groups slept more and walked less after they got sick, and their resting heart rates rose. But these changes were more pronounced in people with COVID-19. “There was a much larger change in resting heart rate for individuals who had COVID compared to other viral infections,” said Jennifer Radin, a public health researcher at Scripps who leads the DETECT trial. “We also have a much more drastic change in steps and sleep.”The scientists also found that about nine days after participants with COVID first began reporting symptoms, their heart rates dropped. After this dip, which was not observed in those with other illnesses, their heart rates rose again and remained elevated for months. It took 79 days, on average, for their resting heart rates to return to normal, compared with just four days for those in the non-COVID group.This prolonged heart rate elevation may be a sign that COVID-19 disrupts the autonomic nervous system, which regulates basic physiological processes. The heart palpitations and dizziness reported by many people who are recovering from COVID may be symptoms of this disruption.“Lots of people who get COVID end up getting autonomic dysfunction and a kind of ongoing inflammation, and this may adversely affect their body’s ability to regulate their pulse,” Radin said.Sleep and physical activity levels also returned to baseline more slowly in those with COVID-19 compared to those with other ailments, Radin and her colleagues found.The researchers identified a small subset of people with COVID whose heart rates remained more than five beats per minute above normal one to two months after infection. Nearly 14% of those with the disease fell into this category, and their heart rates did not return to normal for more than 133 days, on average.These participants were also significantly more likely to report having had a cough, shortness of breath and body aches during the acute phase of their illness than did other COVID patients.One limitation of the study is that it did not ask participants to continue reporting their symptoms in the weeks and months after they first fell ill. But the scientists are planning to ask volunteers to do that in future research.“We want to kind of do a better job of collecting long-term symptoms so we can compare the physiological changes that we’re seeing with symptoms that participants are actually experiencing,” Radin said. “So this is really a preliminary study that opens up many other studies down the road.”In February, the National Institutes of Health announced that it would provide $1.15 billion over the next four years to fund research on long COVID. The new study highlights the role that wearables could play in that research, Hirten said: “Combining these sort of techniques with other studies that are being done looking at this issue of long-term symptoms could really offer a nice objective insight into what’s going on with people.”This article originally appeared in The New York Times.",https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/9b2340e8-c35a-4403-bab6-a2328f7e2884-780x520.jpg
"'Was there a bone saw?' How Trump helped the Saudis whitewash the murder of Jamal Khashoggi - Yahoo News
In early October 2018, just a few days after Jamal Khashoggi had disappeared inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, White House officials first saw the TV footage that stopped them in their tracks.A supposed Khashoggi look-alike — a heavy-set man wearing the journalist’s clothes and glasses — could be seen walking out of the consulate as though he didn’t have a care in the world. Kirsten Fontenrose, then the director of Gulf affairs at the National Security Council, suspected right away what this was: a scene clumsily crafted to cover up a murder.“When that footage kept playing, all of us were looking at each other saying, ‘OK, does this mean they premeditated this? Is this what we’re looking at here?’” says Fontenrose, who knew Khashoggi and would regularly have coffee with him every few weeks near the White House. “Because this is a disaster. This is crazy. Can this really be happening?”The story of how the Trump White House responded to Khashoggi’s gruesome murder — and ultimately helped cover up the crime — is the subject of “Anatomy of a Cover-up,” the eighth and final episode in the Yahoo News “Conspiracyland” podcast series, “The Secret Lives and Brutal Death of Jamal Khashoggi.”It is a story in which American values and rhetorical support for human rights around the world collided head first with perceived U.S. strategic and economic interests in the region. And it is a tension that carried over into the Biden administration when the new president, having pledged during his campaign to turn the Saudi kingdom into a world “pariah,” chose not to impose any penalties on the person who the CIA had concluded was responsible for Khashoggi’s murder: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS.It is also a story — related in a special episode of “Conspiracyland,” “Training the Assassins” — in which Trump officials maneuvered to remove American fingerprints from the crime. President Donald Trump had nominated Louis Bremer, a managing director of the New York-based investment firm Cerberus Capital Management, to be assistant secretary of defense for special operations. But Bremer — whose boss, Steve Feinberg, served as chair of Trump’s intelligence advisory board — had potential baggage: He served on a five-person board of Tier 1 Group, an Arkansas-based company owned by Cerberus that had a State Department license to train Saudi intelligence operatives. The training took place at a compound outside Memphis, where former members of U.S. Special Forces conducted paramilitary courses in staging commando raids, evasive driving and rapid-fire shooting, according to Tier 1's website and YouTube videos it has posted.When Bremer appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee for his confirmation hearing on Aug. 6, 2020, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., grilled him intensely. Was he aware of reports that Tier 1 may have specifically trained members of the Saudi Tiger Team that killed Khashoggi? Had the company conducted any investigation into whether that had happened? Bremer demurred, acknowledging that “I do know that we train Saudi nationals as part of our engagement with the kingdom,” but saying he had “no recollection” of being told that some of them had participated in the Khashoggi murder. He promised, however, to check and provide written answers to the committee.When Bremer did so, and submitted those responses for review to the White House, officials were stunned and realized they had a serious PR problem on their hands. Bremer confirmed his company had indeed conducted such training, “and there were invoices for members of the Saudi hit team,” said one former senior Trump official who was flabbergasted after reading the written responses.Rather than disclose the American connection to Khashoggi’s murder, the White House never forwarded Bremer’s responses to the Senate and his nomination to the top Pentagon post was allowed to die. (Bremer and Cerberus declined to respond to repeated requests for comment from Yahoo News, but the former nominee recently , telling the paper that Tier 1 Group conducted training of members of the Saudi Tiger Team that was “protective in nature.” “The training provided was unrelated to their subsequent heinous acts,” Bremer told the paper.)Khashoggi’s murder sparked a crisis inside the Trump White House. Trump and his top aides, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, had made the Saudis the centerpiece of their Middle East strategy. The president had extolled the Saudis as a bulwark against Iranian aggression. He had taken his first foreign trip to Saudi Arabia and cultivated MBS, welcoming him to the White House and gushing in front of the TV cameras about the billions of dollars in weapons the Saudis were buying from U.S. defense contractors.But the murder of Khashoggi, a U.S.-based journalist writing for one of this country’s leading newspapers, threatened to upend all that. And top officials scrambled to contain the fallout.“Get the full story out, whatever the full story is,” former national security adviser John Bolton says he and Kushner told the crown prince in a phone call shortly after Khashoggi’s disappearance. But Bolton acknowledged he never asked MBS directly the most obvious and important question of all: Did he order the murder? “No, I didn’t, because I hadn't spoken to the president at that point,” Bolton said in an interview for “Conspiracyland.” “It was not something that I wanted to raise before I knew what direction Trump was going to go in.”Soon enough, Trump himself was on the phone to both MBS and his father, King Salman, pressing for answers as well, according to Fontenrose, who monitored the calls.“The president had multiple calls with MBS and with King Salman, specifically asking them, 'Did you know anything about this?'” she says. “The president would flat out ask, I mean, up to a dozen times on any individual phone call, whether it was with King Salman or with MBS or both of them, ‘Did you have any knowledge of this operation?’ ‘Did you know this was going to happen?’ ‘Did you give this order?’”And every time it was, ‘No, no, no, we didn't know anything, and we're still looking and we're still searching.’ ‘Yes, Donald, we totally understand this makes things difficult for you, and we're trying to get to the bottom of it.'’’One piece of intelligence in particular had gotten Trump’s attention. U.S. officials had concluded that the Saudis had used a bone saw to carve up Khashoggi’s body.“I mean, he would go back to it and back to it and back to it, trying to press them and telling them, you know, ‘This will change everything, you guys. We’ve got to know. We’re with you. We're standing behind Saudi Arabia ... but we’ve got to get to the bottom of this. Was there a bone saw? Was there a bone saw?“‘I’ve been in difficult negotiations. I’ve never had to take a bone saw.’”At one point Trump turned to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, according to Fontenrose, and asked: “‘Have you ever had to take a bone saw into negotiations?’ ‘No, Mr. President, ha-ha.’ And pressing, pressing, pressing, and every time, ‘No, no, no, Donald, we didn't know anything about it. We’re still trying to get to the bottom of this.’""While these talks were going on, the Saudis were issuing an ever-shifting series of denials. At first, three days after the murder, MBS had insisted in a Bloomberg interview that Khashoggi had left the consulate and the Saudis had no idea what happened to him. Then, as Turkish officials started to leak details of secret audiotapes they had made from inside the consulate, the Saudis declared that Khashoggi had died in a “fistfight.”Finally they settled on a different narrative: Khashoggi had been murdered by “rogue killers” who acted on their own. It was a formulation Trump immediately adopted — and proclaimed to the world.“I just spoke with the king of Saudi Arabia, who denies any knowledge of what took place with regard to, as he said, his Saudi Arabian citizen,” Trump said on Oct. 15. “It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?”The message was clear. Trump was determined to protect the Saudis — even if, as Bolton suggests, he knew the Saudi leaders’ denials were lies.“I think this was a case where Trump very decisively and flatly decided he was going to continue to support the Saudis on a very realpolitik basis. That’s unpleasant, to be sure, but we live in an unpleasant world,” Bolton said. “Look, I think Trump knew and acted on the assumption that the highest levels of the royal family were involved in it, and he made his decision in any event. And at that point, the issue was closed for the rest of us, for Mike Pompeo, for myself. The president had made up his mind.”Trump also made that reasoning perfectly clear when speaking to reporters on Nov. 20.“If we abandon Saudi Arabia, it will be a terrible mistake,"" Trump said. ""They’re buying hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of things from this country. If I say, ‘We don’t want to take your business,’ if I say, ‘We’re going to cut it off,’ they will get the equipment, military equipment and other things from Russia and China. And I’m not going to tell a country that’s spending hundreds of billions of dollars — and has helped me out [to] do one thing very importantly, keep oil prices down so they're not going to 100 and 150 dollars a barrel. And I’m not going to destroy the economy for our country by being foolish with Saudi Arabia. It’s about America first.”Trump’s formulation — that the Saudis needed to be protected over their role in a ghastly murder so as not to disrupt lucrative arms deals — was too much for Sen. Bob Corker, then the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “To equate the probable murder of a journalist who worked for a U.S. institution, to equate that with our ability to sell arms … it was hard to believe that any president would stoop to that level of equivocation,” he said. “It was a low moment, in my opinion, as far as the moral leadership of the United States of America.”And yet as he looks back on it, Bolton — who would famously break with Trump in a tell-all book — continues to defend the White House response, comparing MBS to the notorious Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza, who was backed by the U.S. for decades despite a lengthy record of human rights abuses.“Franklin Roosevelt once said of Anastasio Somoza, a Central American dictator, ‘He may be an SOB, but he's our SOB.’ I'm with Roosevelt on this,” said Bolton in his interview for “Conspiracyland.” “I don't know where the rest of you all are, but that's just the way it goes.”“Are you saying that MBS is your SOB?” he was asked during the “Conspiracyland” interview.“No, I'm saying he's the U.S.’s SOB,” he responded. “If somebody's got a different idea of how to deal with Saudi Arabia, then let’s hear it.”While running for president, Joe Biden suggested he did have a very different idea. “We [are] going to in fact make them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are, and so they have to be held accountable,” he said during a 2019 debate when asked about Khashoggi’s murder.But when he had the chance to do so in February, the price was a marginal one. Biden’s new director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, released a report that had been withheld by the Trump White House and that found that MBS did approve the operation that killed Khashoggi.But the report was skimpy, containing few new details about what the U.S. intelligence community knew about the murder. And the administration declined to impose any sanctions or punishment for MBS or any other high-level Saudi figures — a failure that Secretary of State Antony Blinken struggled to defend at a press conference.“I would say the relationship with Saudi Arabia is an important one,” Blinken said. “We have significant ongoing interests. We remain committed to the defense of the kingdom. So what we’ve done by the actions we’ve taken is not to rupture the relationship but to recalibrate it to be more in line with our interests and our values. This is bigger than any one person.”And as if to underscore the point, the Pentagon confirmed that just days before the release of the report essentially accusing MBS of murder, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin called his counterpart in Riyadh, the Saudi defense minister, the very same MBS. The purpose, according to a Pentagon readout of the call, was to “reaffirm the strategic defense partnership between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”In case you missed it:Episode 1:Episode 2:Episode 3:Episode 4:Episode 5: Episode 6: Episode 7: Bonus Episode 1: ""Training the assassins"" Cover thumbnail photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: courtesy of Hanan Al-Atr (2), Dylan Martinez/Reuters____Read more from Yahoo News:",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Saudi Arabia funds new digital news platform in U.S., launches White House lobbying effort - CNBC
Saudi Arabia is funding a yet-to-be-announced digital news platform, which will have a studio in Washington, D.C., as the kingdom begins a new lobbying effort aimed at the White House and Congress.The new effort, which had yet to be reported, is being backed by a subsidiary of the Saudi Technology Development and Investment Co., or Taqnia, according to new foreign lobbying disclosures filed with the Department of Justice.Journalists and presenters involved in the project have past experience at Fox News, Al Jazeera, NBC and SiriusXM satellite radio.The creation of what one of the documents calls a ""news platform"" comes as the kingdom has started hiring a new team of lobbyists as the Saudis seek access to President Joe Biden's administration and the new Congress.It also arrives almost three years after the death of Washington Post journalist and Saudi royal family critic Jamal Khashoggi. A recent U.S. intelligence report says Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved an operation to capture or kill Khashoggi.Biden, however, opted not to punish the crown prince for his alleged role in Khashoggi's death.""We held accountable all the people in that organization — but not the crown prince, because we have never that I'm aware of, when we have an alliance with a country, gone to the acting head of state and punished that person and ostracized him,"" Biden said in a recent interview with ABC News.The subsidiary backing the initiative is Taqnia ETS, a company that focuses on engineering and technological services for Saudi Arabia.PitchBook says Taqnia is based in Saudi Arabia, which ""prefers to invest in the life sciences and health, security and defense, information and communication technology, material sciences, energy and environment and water technology sectors.""Taqnia's website says it is owned by the kingdom's over $400 billion Public Investment Fund, or PIF, the country's massive sovereign wealth fund that's meant to invest into projects and help boost Saudi Arabia's economy. The lobbying disclosure report says Taqnia ETS is ""supervised and financed by the Saudi Ministry of Information.""The PIF's executive board includes members of the royal family such as the crown prince.The lobbying documents give a glimpse into the upcoming Saudi-led news venture.One of the lobbying disclosures shows that a company called Prime Time Media is helping lead the effort. Prime Time Media's CEO, Elie Nakouzi, is assisting in the creation of the new digital news organization. His company is getting paid at least $1.6 million, the document shows, to help guide the project.The purchase order included in the lobbying disclosure describes the work being done by Prime Time Media as ""English content for news platform."" More than $75,000 has already been spent on equipment, freelancers and a Washington, D.C., studio, the documents say.The lobbying filings were signed by Nakouzi last month and the purchase order included with the disclosure is dated September 2020. The order form is marked by Taqnia ETS' logo.One of the documents listing Nakouzi says Prime Time Media will ""assist client in the video production of English news content. In doing so, registrant will not participate in the dissemination of said news content.""Nakouzi, who, according to the disclosure, has citizenship in Lebanon but resides in the United States, has a history of working in Middle East media circles. While working for an Arabic television network, Nakouzi interviewed then President George W. Bush during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Nakouzi confirmed to CNBC in an email several aspects of Taqnia's project, including that it will be a new online platform and that a studio has been created. He declined to comment further on the news content of the upcoming site and referred all questions to Taqnia who did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.""Taqnia plans to launch an international online platform before the end of this year,"" Nakouzi said in an email Tuesday. ""As for the Studio, we have built a fully equipped virtual green room for future use,"" he added while noting that it will be based in Washington.""Prime Time Media is not entitled to speak on their behalf. We are a video production house and we don't do lobbying or PR services,"" Nakouzi said.Eric Ham and Craig Boswell, two U.S.-based journalists, will be anchoring online shows for the Saudi-funded venture. Both Ham and Boswell have so far been paid $6,000 each for what's described on the disclosure reports as being writers and presenters.""Mr. Eric Ham and Mr. Craig Boswell will be hosting online shows that are still in production phase,"" Nakouzi said in the email.Boswell and Ham did not return requests for comment before publication.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Is this the end of OPEC? How Saudi Arabia and UAE infighting threatens the future of the oil alliance - CNBC
LONDON — Oil producer group OPEC has been plunged into crisis, with bitter infighting between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates raising questions about the future of the energy alliance.OPEC and non-OPEC partners, a group of some of the world's most powerful oil producers,  after last week's meetings unexpectedly failed to broker a deal on oil production policy. The group did not set a new date to resume talks.It means no agreement has been reached on a possible increase in crude production beyond the end of July, leaving oil markets in a state of limbo just as global fuel demand recovers from the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.""OPEC+ has been thrown its most serious crisis since last year's ill-fated price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia,"" Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in a research note.""Back-channel talks reportedly are continuing, but questions about UAE's commitment to remaining in OPEC will likely grow in the coming days.""The UAE-Saudi dispute appeared to be about more than oil policy, Croft said, with Abu Dhabi ""seemingly intent on stepping outside Saudi Arabia's shadow and charting its own course in global affairs.""OPEC+, which is dominated by Middle East crude producers, agreed to implement massive crude production cuts in 2020 in an effort to support oil prices when the coronavirus pandemic coincided with a historic fuel demand shock.Led by Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the UAE, OPEC+ has met monthly to decide on production policy.The disarray comes after OPEC+ on Friday voted on a proposal to increase oil production by roughly 2 million barrels per day between August and the end of the year in 400,000 barrels per day monthly installments. It also proposed to extend the remaining output cuts to the end of 2022., however, which wants a higher baseline to its quota to allow for more domestic production.""No agreement was reached and as we stand now the OPEC+ alliance, if it is still the right word to describe the group, will produce at the July level for the rest of the year,"" Tamas Varga, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note.""The [non-] outcome of the meeting re-writes the supply-demand landscape for the near and potentially for the distant future,"" he added.The rare public stand-off between the UAE and Saudi Arabia saw energy ministers from both countries engaging in a media blitz over the weekend to outline their respective positions.""For us, it wasn't a good deal,"" UAE Minister of Energy and Infrastructure Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Sunday.

At one point, WTI crude hit as high as $76.98, Oil prices rallied more than 45% in the first half of the year, supported by the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, a gradual easing of lockdown measures and massive production cuts from OPEC+.Samuel Burman, assistant commodities economist at Capital Economics, said OPEC producers were likely to increase oil production above quota next month as member states ""seek to take advantage"" of higher oil prices.In addition to a rift between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, he said Abu Dhabi was probably ""somewhat irritated"" that Russia hadn't been complying with OPEC's production quotas.Burman said non-OPEC leader Russia hadn't introduced any compensatory cuts at all and was currently overproducing by around 100,000 barrels per day. ""We think that this spat involving the UAE increases the chances that the entire agreement falls apart which would clearly pose a downside risk to our near-term price forecasts.""— CNBC's Patti Domm contributed to this report.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
