"Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. ruled out for World Series - New York Post
HOUSTON —Lance McCullers Jr. won’t pitch for the Astros this series.Arguably Houston’s best pitcher was finally ruled out on Monday after he suffered a strained elbow during the ALDS. McCullers said it’s the type of injury that takes six to eight weeks to heal to the point he could pick up a ball.“We tried to push it as far as we could, but just couldn’t make it back to throwing,’’ McCullers said Monday at Minute Maid Park. “It’s disappointing. I’m just going to keep doing what I can do and have all the faith in our team and the guys that we have out there and try to win a World Series.Framber Valdez, who pitched eight innings in Game 5 of the ALDS against the Red Sox, will start for the Astros in Game 1 on Tuesday and Houston manager Dusty Baker said though the team had decided on a Game 2 starter, he wouldn’t announce it.McCullers had a 3.16 ERA in the regular season and pitched twice against the White Sox in the ALDS.The Astros enter the World Series with a better record than Atlanta, but no team was hotter than the Braves after the trade deadline. They’re 44-22 since they bolstered their team on July 30, remaking their outfield.Freddie Freeman called it “pretty amazing” the Braves were still playing given how their season went and the moves it made at the deadline. Marcell Ozuna is on administrative leave after being arrested on assault charges after allegedly assaulting his wife. Ronald Acuna Jr. had surgery to repair his ACL and the Braves were saved by the arrival of Joc Pederson, Eddie Rosario, Jorge Soler and Adam Duvall.“We’ve got a whole different team pretty much in the outfield,’’ Freeman said. “We were just trying to figure out how all this worked. … We were just trying to figure out how all these pieces fit on our team. Next thing you know, about a month in, the pieces started fitting, and we started rolling as a group. To have a whole new outfield that you did in April than you did at the end of July, it’s hard to do.”As Baker prepares to face the organization that drafted him in the World Series, he was asked about the effect Hank Aaron had on him.“I think about him all the time, especially in a series like this,’’ Baker said. “I feel his presence, especially him and my dad.”Baker made his MLB debut with Atlanta in 1968, when he was 19 and Aaron was a 34-year-old slugger. “He had a tremendous impact not only on the baseball field, but in my life and in my family and in business. I’ll be forever grateful to him, and he’s had probably a great impact also on [Atlanta manager Brian] Snitker over there because he hired him when Hank was a farm director to begin his managerial career. So Hank’s footprints are all over this series.”This is Baker’s second appearance managing in the World Series — and first since 2002, when he was with the Giants. San Francisco lost to the Angels in a series in which one of the most memorable moments was J.T. Snow grabbing Baker’s 3-year-old son, Darren, who was a bat boy for the Giants and was near home plate as Snow crossed the plate.“Time passes very quickly, and we are remembering that time,’’ Baker said of Darren, who is now 22 and was drafted by the Nationals in the 10th round of this year’s amateur draft. “Everybody remembers that except him. He’s the only one that doesn’t remember it. People remind him of it all the time. Sometimes he gets tired of talking about it, but it is part of my history, Giants history, baseball history, and his history. Now he’s trying to make his own history with the Nationals as a player, and I’m just glad that he was able to be here for this.”",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Tom Brady's 600th touchdown pass: How much did Bucs fan squander by giving up historic football? - CBS Sports
Byron Kennedy was enjoying the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' blowout win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday when he became part of history. The 29-year-old Buccaneers fan was recording Tom Brady's  when Mike Evans -- whose jersey was being worn by Kennedy -- surprised Kennedy by giving him the ball. According to CBS Sports lead field reporter Tracy Wolfson, Kennedy gave the ball back in exchange for at least another game ball as well as a signed jersey. On Monday, Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times reported that Kennedy will receive two signed jerseys and a helmet from Brady, a signed Evans jersey and his game cleats, a $1,000 credit at the Buccaneers' team store, and two season passes for the remainder of this season as well as next season.Postgame, Kennedy said that he was hesitant to give up the ball, which is estimated to be worth upwards of $500,000, according to Ken Goldin, the founder of Goldin Auctions. Goldin said the ball's worth could ""easily"" go for $900,000 when comparing it to how much 500 home run baseballs fetch on the open market. Given Brady is the only person to throw 600 touchdowns, whereas there are 28 members of the 500 home run club in the universe, that puts Brady's ball in a stratosphere all to itself. Brady, who had the ball in his possession during his postgame press conference, said that Kennedy was ""going to get something nice in return, so we'll get him a helmet or a couple of jerseys or some other stuff. It was really cool of him to do that."" As stated above, that is indeed what happened.What an experience @Buccaneers @MikeEvans13_ @TomBrady Kennedy, despite relinquishing a half-million dollar football, is happy that the ball is back in the possession of its rightful owner. He also was able to take several photos of himself with the record-setting ball before giving it back to the Buccaneers. ""I knew how much it meant to Tom,"" Kennedy said, ""and I was willing to trade.""Can Tom Brady win his eighth Super Bowl at age 44?

"Mark Zuckerberg Let False Anti-Abortion Video Back On Facebook To Mollify GOP: Report - HuffPost
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg intervened to reinstate a false anti-abortion video to assuage conservative Republican politicians, according to internal company documents Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen provided to Congress that .The incident was reportedly one of several instances of Facebook senior executives countermanding company policy to allow American politicians and celebrities to post whatever they wanted despite pleas from employees to moderate the content, according to the documents.Facebook particularly made exceptions for right-wing misinformation in the wake of relentless criticism from people such as former President Donald Trump that Facebook is biased against conservative views, the documents indicate.In one such instance, Zuckerberg was “personally involved” in a 2019 decision to reinstate an anti-abortion video that a moderator had removed from Facebook because of notable — and potentially dangerous — misinformation, according to the documents.Zuckerberg intervened after Republican politicians including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley wrote to accuse Facebook of censorship regarding the video, the Financial Times and Business Insider reported.The video falsely insisted that abortion is “never medically necessary,” the Financial Times recounted. There are multiple situations in which abortions are medically necessary to save the life or health of someone who is pregnant. In fact, Ireland eased its abortion laws in 2018 following outrage over one such case: the fatal septic miscarriage of 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar after doctors refused to perform an abortion on her because of legal constraints. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as Physicians for Reproductive Health, issued a statement in response to the anti-abortion video saying that “.”Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Zuckerberg’s role in reinstating the anti-abortion video.Haugen, a former Facebook employee who , has provided copies of thousands of pages of internal Facebook documents that supported her testimony against Facebook earlier this month before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection.Haugen and many of the so-called “Facebook Papers” have revealed that company executives are . They also know that polarization results in more customer engagement that increases company profits at the expense of social safety, Haugen testified.Zuckerberg has disputed that characterization of the company.In testimony Monday before a U.K. Parliament committee, Haugen said Facebook  and called for an overhaul of the company.She advocated for greater transparency and said that an outside regulator should insist that Facebook provide solutions to a litany of harms.“Instead of investing in 10,000 engineers to make the metaverse, invest in 10,000 engineers to make our world safer,” she urged.

Amid reports that Facebook has misled shareholders about significant declines in teens and younger users, Mark Zuckerberg said the company was “retooling” in order to make “serving young adults” its top priority. To do that, the company plans to make “significant changes” to its Facebook and Instagram apps, and spend billions of dollars building out its vision for a “metaverse.”Citing increased competition from TikTok and iMessage, Zuckerberg said the company would do more to win over “young adult” users between the ages of 18 to 29, even if it came at the expense of older users. Speaking during the company's third-quarter earnings call, he said the company’s TikTok rival Reels would be “as important for our products as Stories.” “We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in the next year to further lean into video and make Reels a more central part of the experience,” Zuckerberg said.On top of that, he said the company was “retooling” internally in order to make young people its “North Star.” He added the shift “will take years, not months.” The issue of younger users has been particularly fraught for the company. A whistleblower’s disclosures about Facebook’s internal research on teen mental health prompted a series of Congressional hearings about child safety, and a wave of headlines about how the photo sharing app may be harmful to some of its most vulnerable users. At the same time, other internal documents have indicated Facebook and Instagram have faced significant declines in engagement among teens and young adults for years.Zuckerberg said another major priority for the company would be building its vision for a “metaverse.” He didn’t comment on reports that the company would change its name to reflect its new focus on augmented reality and virtual reality, but made clear the company has significant ambitions in the space. “Our goal is to help the metaverse reach a billion people,” he said. He added that a metaverse could enable “hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.”The company also said Monday that going forward it will report two sets of financials: one for its “family” of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp; and one for its Reality Labs division that oversees its augmented and virtual reality work. In a statement, Facebook said its 2021 profit will be reduced by $10 billion due to its investment in Reality Labs, and that the company would only increase its AR and VR spending in the next “several years.”Zuckerberg also addressed the ongoing revelations stemming from the ""Facebook Papers,"" a series of articles based on documents provided by former employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen. The CEO referred to the work from a consortium of news organizations as ""a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company."" The documents, which have been the basis of more than a dozen stories detailing Facebook's botched efforts to fight hate speech and other harms, have also been provided to members of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Any honest account should be clear that these issues aren't primarily about social media,"" Zuckerberg said.

Ecosia, the search engine that uses its ad revenue to plant trees, has launched a 350 million euro ($405 million) venture capital fund focused on the climate crisis.The so-called World Fund will invest in the ""next generation"" of founders looking to tackle the issue, Ecosia said, and will measure its success on ""climate returns"" as well as financial returns.""Our goal is to solve climate change,"" Ecosia CEO Christian Kroll told CNBC ahead of the launch on Tuesday, just days before the COP26 climate summit.""We've been doing that at Ecosia for a long time by planting trees,"" Kroll said, adding that the company has planted 136 million trees so far. ""But that alone won't be enough to solve climate change.""Research published Tuesday shows that climate tech start-ups have raised more money so far this year than they have in any other year, with $32 billion pumped into start-ups tackling climate change around the world since the start of 2021.The Ecosia search engine has 15 million monthly active users and it expects to report annual revenues of 25 million euros ($29 million) this year. The size of its user base pales in comparison to Google, however, which has billions of users.Kroll said Ecosia is ""extremely well connected to a lot of climate start-ups"" but it's unable to support them with the money it's generating through its search engine.""Our promise to our users is that if you search with us we use the money for tree planting,"" he said. ""If we were to put that into risky start-ups and it then doesn't work out then it wouldn't be so well received.""He hopes that setting up a separate VC fund that raises capital from alternative sources will help to eliminate this issue.Bill Gates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, said in an interview that aired Wednesday that  The people at Ecosia have a similar view, believing that the most valuable companies of the next decade will be those enabling a decarbonized world. More than half of the funding for the World Fund has already been committed from entrepreneurs and large institutions, Ecosia said, adding that the fund has made three investments that are yet to be announced.""We've invested in a plant-based meats firm revolutionizing the top-end of the market and a cocoa replacement firm that cuts back on deforestation,"" said Danijel Visevic, head of investments at Ecosia and head of World Fund.In total, the World Fund will be used to back around 40 early stage and ""growth"" stage companies.One important caveat to note is that every company that World Fund invests in must contribute to a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Specifically, the Fund will only invest in companies that have the potential to remove 100 megatons of carbon dioxide each year from the atmosphere.""Everything comes back to that figure, regardless of what the technology is,"" World Fund Partner Craig Douglas told CNBC.The World Fund said it will look to back carbon-cutting companies in food and agriculture, transportation and the ""built environment,"" among others.Ecosia claims that the World Fund is the biggest of its kind in Europe, while the world's biggest is operated by Gates's Breakthrough Ventures and stands at $2 billion.Global climate tech VC investment has soared from $6.6 billion in 2016 to $32.3 billion in 2021 so far, an increase in funding by almost five times, according to a report from promo agency London & Partners and VC analysis firm Dealroom.co.The VC industry has traditionally been somewhat reluctant to invest in climate tech start-ups but Dara Saharova, a general partner at World Fund, said companies in the sector that were founded between 2008 and 2013 now have a market cap of around $800 billion.""In Europe, there's a lot of people who invest $1 million to $5 million, and there's some big institutions now who are willing to put in, you know $30 million plus per company,"" Douglas said.

A new King County rule that took effect on Monday  to dine-in at bars and restaurants, to work out in gyms and to enjoy indoor entertainment venues such as theaters and museums in King County. The new rule also applies to conferences and conventions, and any large outdoor gatherings with more than 500 people — though children under age 12, who aren’t yet eligible for a vaccine, are exempt. So far, a day into the implementation of the rule, business owners have mixed feelings about the new requirement. Many Seattle-area restaurant and bar owners were  And some leaders of Seattle museums and business owners are happy about the new measure that public health officials say could help slow the spread of the virus. But other Seattle businesses say they have already lost customers because of the vaccination requirement, and the owners don’t want another regulation that they claim hurts small businesses, especially at a time when they’re already struggling from .Leonard Garfield, executive director of Seattle’s Museum of History & Industry, has been looking forward to the vaccination requirement and the effect it will have on the museum’s visitors. “We think the net effect will be that our visitors and our community will feel safer knowing that everyone around them in that venue is fully vaccinated and ready to enjoy life knowing that they’re healthy and safe,” he said.Other museums, including the Burke Museum and the Wing Luke Museum, which won’t open until later this week, are also expecting everything to go smoothly for patrons. Jeff Brein, who owns the Seattle-area movie theater group Far Away Entertainment, is also optimistic — but cautiously so — about the new regulation’s effects on his two Seattle movie theaters: Varsity Theatre in the University District and the Historic Admiral Theater in the North Admiral neighborhood. He said Far Away Entertainment has been getting emails for the past four or five months from customers saying they won’t go back to movie theaters unless there is a vaccine policy. He’s hopeful that with the proof of vaccine requirement, movie theaters may see an increase in patrons. If that’s the case, Far Away Entertainment may consider introducing the mandate at theaters in other counties, or doing vaccine-only showtimes. Some business owners, though, are already seeing negative consequences from the requirement.Transform 180, a gym focused on personal training with locations in Belltown and South Lake Union, lost 15% of its members in the days leading up to when the vaccine or test requirement started, according to its owner, Charith Madawela. He said his revenue hasn’t recovered to anywhere near pre-pandemic levels, and the loss in members is a big hit. Many of his former clients are still not coming to work out even if they are vaccinated because they don’t want to train in a mask, he said.Justin Young, who owns Flow Fitness’s two Seattle locations, said he thinks it’s unfair that the government continues to roll out new pandemic restrictions that hurt small businesses without helping them handle the costs. Meanwhile, John Carrico, who owns NW Fitness Gym in downtown Seattle with Jess, his wife, said they’ve also lost several gym members and an employee who didn’t want to get vaccinated because of the requirement. He said around 250 out of 450 gym members already sent in their vaccine cards, but he’s frustrated by the amount of work it will be to track down the other 200 who might have missed his emails or aren’t willing to get vaccinated. “We, unfortunately, have grown accustomed to having to adapt to some form of regulation almost every three months for the last two years,” Carrico said. “It just piles on the work for our already-taxed team.” But he said they may get some new members who are now comfortable working out because of the vaccine requirement, which might help make up for the loss of members they’ve seen so far. For Michelle Cozzaglio, co-owner and curator of the Oddities & Curiosities Expo coming to the Washington State Convention Center on Oct. 30, the new regulation has become a major hurdle — particularly the requirement that non-vaccinated attendees show a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event.Cozzaglio, who is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has been hearing from customers who bought their tickets weeks and months ago, who say testing delays might make them miss the event. “I’ve had to refund people, and we typically have no refunds,” she said. On top of that, the expo — which brings together vendors of dark art, taxidermy and other cabinet-of-curiosity-type goods — has had to hire a staffing service to make sure all attendees comply with the new regulation.Some Seattle restaurant owners see the requirement as another barrier to profitability in an industry that’s been struck particularly hard by past pandemic regulations and the labor shortage. They’re also concerned the requirement will put added pressure on staff. “Many restaurants have struggled to hire workers during the pandemic, and adding staff for the front door to check vaccine status has created an added challenge,” said Steve Hooper, president of Seattle’s Ethan Stowell Restaurants group. Stowell said in August he’s had to .Bart Evans, the owner of Bluwater Bistro in Seattle’s Leschi neighborhood, is so supportive of vaccinations that , but even he has mixed feelings about the requirement for customers because he’s worried about how to enforce it. “Our staff is fully vaccinated,” Evans said. “It’s only fair that we expect our customers to be.” He’s worried, though, about putting his staff in a position where they have to bar people from the restaurant. His employees are used to welcoming people, not acting as bouncers.“It’s not a role we like to play or are used to,” Evans said. “We’re not a nightclub in Pioneer Square.”Seattle Times staff reporters Brendan Kiley and Crystal Paul contributed to this story.

Two teens developed severe psychiatric symptoms such as paranoia, delusions and suicidal thoughts during mild COVID-19 infections. Now, scientists think they've identified a potential trigger: Rogue antibodies may have mistakenly attacked the teens' brains, rather than the coronavirus.  The researchers spotted these rogue antibodies in two teens who were examined at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Benioff Children’s Hospital after catching COVID-19 in 2020, according to a new report on the cases published Monday (Oct. 25) in the journal JAMA Neurology. The antibodies appeared in the patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is a clear liquid that flows in and around the hollow spaces of the brain and spinal cord. But while such antibodies may attack brain tissue, it's too early to say that these antibodies directly caused the troubling symptoms in the teens, the researchers wrote in the new study. That's because many of the identified antibodies appear to target structures located on the inside of cells, rather than on the outside, co-author Dr. Samuel Pleasure, a physician-scientist and professor of neurology at UCSF, told Live Science in an email.Related:  ""So, we suspect that either the COVID autoantibodies"" — meaning antibodies that attack the body rather than the virus — ""are indicative of an out of control autoimmune response that might be driving the symptoms, without the antibodies necessarily causing the symptoms directly,"" he said. Future studies will be needed to test this hypothesis, and to see whether any other, undiscovered autoantibodies target structures on the surface of cells and thus cause direct damage, he added.The study's results demonstrate that COVID-19 may trigger the development of brain-targeting autoantibodies, said Dr. Grace Gombolay, a pediatric neurologist at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and an assistant professor at Emory University School of Medicine, who wasn't involved in the new study. And they also hint that, in some cases, treatments that ""calm down"" the immune system may help resolve psychiatric symptoms of COVID-19, she told Live Science in an email. Both teens in the study received intravenous immunoglobulin, a therapy used to essentially reset the immune response in autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, after which the teens' psychiatric symptoms either partially or completely remitted. But it's possible the patients would have ""improved on their own, even without treatment,"" and this study is too small to rule this out, Gombolay noted.Other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, can sometimes drive the development of antibodies that attack brain cells, trigger harmful inflammation and cause neurological symptoms, Gombolay said. ""Thus, it is reasonable to suspect that an association could also be seen in COVID-19.""Prior to their research in teens, the study authors published evidence of neural autoantibodies in adult COVID-19 patients. According to a report published May 18 in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, these adult patients experienced seizures, loss of smell and hard-to-treat headaches, and most of them had also been hospitalized due to the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19.But ""in the case of these teens, the patients had quite minimal respiratory symptoms,"" Pleasure said. This suggests that there's a chance of such symptoms arising during or after cases of mild respiratory COVID-19, Pleasure said.Over the course of five months in 2020, 18 children and teens were hospitalized at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital with confirmed COVID-19; the patients tested positive for the virus with either a PCR or rapid antigen test. From this group of pediatric patients, the study authors recruited three teens who underwent neurological evaluations and became the focus for the new case study. One patient had a history of unspecified anxiety and depression, and after catching COVID-19 they developed signs of delusion and paranoia. The second patient had a history of unspecified anxiety and motor tics, and following infection they experienced rapid mood shifts, aggression and suicidal thoughts; they also experienced ""foggy brain,"" impaired concentration and difficulty completing homework. The third patient, who had no known psychiatric history, was admitted after exhibiting repetitive behaviors, disordered eating, agitation and insomnia for several days, when they hadn't shown these behaviors previously.As part of their neurological examinations, each teen underwent a spinal tap, where a sample of CSF is drawn from the lower back. All three patients had elevated antibody levels in their CSF, but only the CSF of patients 1 and 2 carried antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In those two teens, it's possible the virus itself infiltrated their brains and spinal cords, the study authors noted. ""I would suspect that if there is direct viral invasion it is transient, but there is still a lot of uncertainty here,"" Pleasure noted. ———These same patients also carried neural autoantibodies in their CSF: In mice, the team found that these antibodies latched onto several areas of the brain, including the brain stem; the cerebellum, located at the very back of the brain; the cortex; and the olfactory bulb, which is involved in smell perception. The team then used lab-dish experiments to identify the targets the neural antibodies grabbed onto. The researchers flagged a number of potential targets and zoomed in on one in particular: a protein called transcription factor 4 (TCF4). Mutations in the gene for TCF4 can cause a rare neurological disorder called Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, and some studies hint that dysfunctional TCF4 may be involved in schizophrenia, according to a 2021 report in the journal Translational Psychiatry.These findings hint that the autoantibodies might contribute to a runaway immune response that causes psychiatric symptoms in some COVID-19 patients, but again, the small study cannot prove that the antibodies themselves directly cause disease. It may be that other immune-related factors, apart from the antibodies, drive the emergence of these symptoms. ""These autoantibodies may be most clinically meaningful as markers of immune dysregulation, but we haven’t found evidence that they are actually causing the patients’ symptoms. There’s certainly more work to be done in this area,"" co-first author Dr. Christopher Bartley, an adjunct instructor in psychiatry at the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, said in a statement.In future studies, ""it would … be helpful to examine CSF of children with COVID-19 who did not have neuropsychiatric symptoms,"" as a point of comparison to those who did, Gombolay said. ""However, obtaining CSF from those patients is challenging as CSF has to be obtained by a spinal tap, and a spinal tap is not typically done unless a patient has neurological symptoms.""That said, the team is now collaborating with several groups studying long COVID, who are collecting CSF samples from patients with and without neuropsychiatric symptoms, Pleasure said. ""In adults, it is not uncommon to have patients be willing to undergo a spinal tap for research purposes with appropriate informed consent and institutional review."" Using these samples, as well as some studies in animal models, the team will work to pinpoint the autoimmune mechanisms behind these troubling neuropsychiatric symptoms, and figure out how autoantibodies fit into that picture. Originally published on Live Science.Nicoletta Lanese is a staff writer for Live Science covering health and medicine, along with an assortment of biology, animal, environment and climate stories.

That is not true — if they had invited me I would have accepted it, although I am confused about what we would be speaking about. I said what I said, and boy, I heard what you said. My God, how could I not? You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. It seems like I'm the only one who can't go to the office.""""I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames it that it's me versus that community, that's not what it is. Do not blame the LGBTQ community for any of this. It's about corporate interests, and what I can say, and what I cannot say. For the record, and I need you to know this, everyone I know from that community has been loving and supportive, so I don't know what this nonsense is about.""""This film that I made was invited to every film festival in the United States. Some of those invitations I accepted. When this controversy came out about 'The Closer', they began disinviting me from these film festivals. And now, today, not a film company, not a movie studio, not a film festival, nobody will touch this film. Thank God for Ted Sarandos and Netflix, he's the only one that didn't cancel me yet.""""To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience, but you will not summon me. I am not bending to anyone's demands. And if you want to meet with me, I am more than willing to, but I have some conditions. First of all, you cannot come if you have not watched my special from beginning to end. You must come to a place of my choosing at a time of my choosing, and thirdly, you must admit that Hannah Gadsby is not funny.""",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/07/22/jonathan-franklin-headshot_sq-d53ebffee5769aeb2897fdfbbcd9252ce82c715e-s100-c85.jpg,"The 3 Dune Scenes Denis Villeneuve Wishes Frank Herbert Could See - Screen Rant
Warning: This post contains spoilers for Dune.Denis Villeneuve reveals the three scenes from his Dune he wishes he could show to author Frank Herbert. Villeneuve is far from the first person to attempt bringing Herbert's seminal sci-fi novel to life, but he just might be the most successful. The latest big screen adaptation of Dune arrived this past weekend and has already won over fans and critics alike, particularly those with a fondness for the source material. In addition to grossing a solid $41 million domestically in its first weekend, Dune has amassed over $223 million worldwide.One of the reasons Villeneuve has found success where others like David Lynch struggled is the Oscar-nominated director opted to split Dune into two parts. It begins with the noble House Atreides being granted stewardship of the desert planet of Arrakis, the home to an extremely valuable resource known as spice. Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) is hesitant about following in his father's footsteps as a leader, but when enemies rise up against House Atreides, he might not have much of a choice.Related: Villeneuve's Dune has many standout moments, but there are some in particular that stand out to the director as ones he wishes Herbert himself could see. Speaking to CinemaBlend for their ReelBlend podcast, Villeneuve took the question of which scene he would show the author and expanded upon it by listing off three. The first is one he feels matches Herbert's book, while the second is one that is quite different. The third and final moment is one that holds extra emotions for Villeneuve himself. He said:I think that I would love to show him three scenes. I would love to show him the arrival of the Reverend Mother, followed by the Gom Jabbar. I would love to see how he feels about that. I think that’s pretty close to the book! I think I would love to share with him my interpretation of Paul’s first journey in the desert with the Duke and Gurney, when they see a harvester for the first time, and Paul’s first footstep in the desert. I think that it’s slightly different from the book, and I’m pretty proud of how we brought it to the screen. And I would have loved to see what he felt about that approach.And then, I think that I would have loved to share with him the final sequence of the movie, where Paul finally meets the Fremen. Because THAT is very close to what my dream was when I was a kid. I remember being in the desert, and I was beside Paul Atreides with a camera, and listening to Stilgar in the dark, and I had shivers. I was like, ‘Oh God, it’s so close to what I had in mind when I was a kid.’ Those are the three.Prior to Dune's release, there was a lot of curiosity surrounding where Villeneuve would choose to split the narrative. He previously admitted it was a daunting task, but it's safe to say he chose the perfect one by concluding right when Paul and his mother Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) set out with the Fremen. It leaves the audiences with a sense of more to come, but also firmly closes the door on this first chapter of Paul's story. Should Villeneuve get the , it will pick up with plenty of excitement.As for Villeneuve's other Herbert picks, it's interesting to see he's thinking of scenes that are both similar to the book and different. As with any  does have to take some liberties, but at least the ones he took were made with respect to Herbert's story. Though Herbert sadly cannot pass judgement on Villeneuve's Dune, having passed away in 1986, one has to hope that after all the heart and soul the director poured into this movie, he would've approved.More: Dune Ending ExplainedSource: CinemaBlend",https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/photo/81478822.cms,"'The Voice' coach Blake Shelton's 'soul-crushing' decision: 'My heart's broken right now' - Yahoo Entertainment
As The Voice Season 21 Knockout Rounds commenced Monday, Team Blake hopeful Hailey Green — a shaved-headed, tattooed, 15-year-old badass who’s the ; who originally tried out for the show when she was just 13; and who was once compared to a “cheetah” — made an especially ballsy move by covering her own coach’s “God’s Country,” transforming it into a swampy rawker right in front of him.“Hailey is a bold artist, so it doesn't surprise me that she chose this song, because she doesn't hit me as a type of person to really back down from anything,” declared an amazed Blake Shelton. “I've literally lost years off my life trying to get through that vocal, and listening to you sing that — holy crap,” he raved, after Hailey fearlessly roared through the tune while playing fiery electric guitar. She “filled up this room with energy” according to John Legend, giving the track a Jon Bon Jovi/“Blaze of Glory” stadium vibe.But sadly, Hailey’s glory was short-lived. Unfortunately for her, her Knockouts competitor, Cameroonian chanteuse Libianca, spectacularly performed Billie Eilish's “Everything I Wanted.” And while Libianca, who has both depression and anxiety, struggled and even sobbed during rehearsal, she delivered a confident, jazzy performance that John described as a “master class” once she hit the main stage. You won't believe how powerful @HaileyGreen122 & @libianca3's performances are. ❤️ #VoiceKnockouts #TeamBlake — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021“There was no way in hell I was going to let Libianca leave. I feel like she had the tallest mountain to climb, and she was able to get it together. As a coach, there's no way I can't reward that,” Blake explained. Still, Blake confessed that letting Hailey go, especially after she sang his own song, absolutely crushed his soul. “My heart's broken right now,” he lamented.Yes, many tough decisions had to be made Monday, because at this stage in the game, there were no Saves left in play — only Steals. I was surprised that no other coach stole Hailey, who showed so much raw potential, but Hailey, who turned no chairs when she first tried out for The Voice last year, was simply grateful for another opportunity. “I was here in Season 19 and you told me to come back, and I just want to thank you for giving me that chance,” she graciously told Blake.These were other Knockout Rounds of Monday night — two of which did end in Steals:TEAM BLAKE: Jonathan Mouton vs. Wendy MotenGoing up against a veteran pro backup singer and four-chair frontrunner like Wendy, poor Jonathan — an original Team Legend member who was stolen by Blake in the Battle Rounds — must have known he was the underdog in this Mouton vs. Mouton showdown. His “I Can See Clearly Now” started off promisingly, with a masterful a cappella intro that showcased his pure tone, but the song choice was too light and laid-back, so his performance never really caught fire. Meanwhile, Wendy’s cover of Aretha Franklin’s “Ain’t No Way” was pure fire from the first verse, and she brought the heat throughout. “How do you honor an Aretha Franklin song, and yet breathe so much new life into it?” coach Ariana Grande marveled rhetorically.Ariana called Jonathan’s performance an “amazingly infectious interpretation,” and John said it was “full of heart and joy” and “so inviting.” But John called Wendy’s performance a “tour de force,” and Kelly Clarkson even told Wendy, “You're one of those vocalists that literally is the reason why I'm sitting here.” So, of course, Wendy prevailed. “Jonathan blew me away, but the only problem with that is Wendy blew the building away,” Blake explained. “There is too much talent this season, and it’s really overwhelming,” sighed Ariana, as she and her fellow coaches opted not to steal Jonathan and he exited the show.WINNER: Wendy MotenJonathan Mouton & @WendyMoten will give you instant chills. 🎤 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamBlake — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM ARIANA: Raquel Trinidad vs. Katie RaeIn this experience-vs.-youth pairing, 35-year-old mom Katie faced off against 23-year-old spitfire Raquel — with Katie doing a maudlin ballad, Lauren Daigle’s “Hold On to Me” (dedicated to her much-missed husband and 3-year-old son back home), and the bubbly, bouncy Raquel sassing it up during the Amy Winehouse version of the Zutons’ “Valerie.” Katie showcased the technically better voice — in fact, Ariana called it “one of the most powerful voices I've ever heard” — but her song choice felt old-fashioned and dreary, and her overall performance was staid. Meanwhile, Raquel, an American Idol alumnus and natural-born performer, was undeniably spunky and sparkling, lighting up the stage. Even Katie, sitting in her corner of the ring, couldn’t help but groove along.John said Katie had ""so much heart and connection with the song” and Kelly said Katie had “one of my favorite tones of the whole show,” but Ariana made the tough decision to keep Raquel, whom she called a “star.” But I guess Kelly really did love Katie’s tone, because she used her one Steal of the Knockouts on Katie, explaining, “I feel like I don't have anybody like her on my team. I've wanted Katie Rae since the Blinds, y'all, so I finally got her!” We will see if Katie can stand out more in Live Playoffs; song choice will be key.WINNER: Raquel Trinidad / STOLEN: Katie Rae moves to Team KellyKatie Rae & @groovyraq's performances are SO outstanding. 🔥 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamAriana — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM KELLY: Gymani vs. Kinsey RoseKelly self-deprecatingly admitted that she was an “idiot” to pair up such very different singers — a fiery soul stylist like Gymani and a sweet vintage-country crooner like Kinsey. Kinsey’s winsome cover of Deana Carter’s ‘90s hit “Strawberry Wine” was pleasant and pretty, but she was definitely disadvantaged following Gymani’s vocal-gymnastic workout of Zayn’s “Pillowtalk,” a passionate performance that had Mega Mentor Ed Sheeran comparing her to the almighty Jazmine Sullivan. “You ain’t never heard ‘Pillowtalk’ like this!” bragged Kelly, who ultimately picked the “better competitor” and saved Gymani. “What Gymani did with ‘Pillowtalk’ made me recognize she really came to win,” Kelly explained. I was surprised that Blake didn’t steal Kinsey, a four-chair contestant that vowed to “keep making country music” and probably would have won any other Knockout, but he said, “I didn't use my Steal for Kinsey, because I'm really trying to narrow down to one great country artist on my team this season.” WINNER: Gymani.@kellyclarkson has a tough decision to make between @IAmGymani & @KinseyRoseMusic. 😱 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamKelly — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM LEGEND: Sabrina Dias vs. Joshua VacantiJoshua’s cover of Harry Styles’s plaintive heartbreak ballad “Falling” was very dramatic — maybe too dramatic. I think he needed to practice more restraint to tap into the song's muted sadness and sense of defeat, but Joshua ramped up way too soon, pretty much 10 seconds into the first verse. That being said, it was a proper showcase for his elastic, operatic voice, and the coaches were wowed. Meanwhile, Sabrina held back too much during her cover of Ed Sheeran’s “Photograph” — a song she’d picked before she knew Ed would actually be this season's Mega Mentor, so maybe she was nervous. However, her drumming was super-cool and something we hadn’t seen since Vicci Martinez banged the drums in Season 1.All of the coaches were impressed by the fact that Sabrina brought out a drum kit and a guitar (a one-woman-band performance that was actually quite Sheeran-esque) while not letting all that multi-tasking compromise her vocals. But Kelly loved Joshua’s “big and round” tone, Blake said Joshua “came out and swung for the fence,” and John said Joshua “made the audience feel every single word that you sing.” I just wish Sabrina had done more drumming, rather than standing behind her kit like it was a stage prop for most of her song, because that would have helped her stand out more — and possibly survive. Perhaps she was just doomed by doing Ed’s song, just as Hailey was doomed by doing Blake’s.WINNER: Joshua Vacanti.@joshuavacanti singing @harry_styles & @sabrinadiasmusi singing @edsheeran? Yes, please! 👏 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamLegend — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM KELLY: Girl Named Tom vs. Holly ForbesBoth four-chair contestants, these two conjured magic tonight and lived up to their early promise. Holly, who had been frustratingly montaged during the Battles after getting a ton of screentime during the Blinds, was fully back and more brilliant than ever on the aptly titled “Superstar.” This was an exquisite vocal (Kelly called it “beautiful” and “edgy”) that even had Ariana saying, “Your voice is the kind that I grew up hearing and being like, ‘I want to sing!’” But sibling trio Girl Named Tom’s “Wichita Lineman,” dedicated to their terminally ill father, was also “flawless,” according to John, and Ariana said it was awards-ceremony-level.Kelly was probably thinking once again that she was an “idiot” for putting these two frontrunners together, but she ultimately reasoned, “Holly, she's got such a rad voice, but I had to pick Girl Named Tom because they sound amazing together, but then they showed how each of them sound alone, and they can hold their own. That was so hard!”Holly was too awesome to pass up, of course, so both John and Ariana went in for the Steal — reviving a rivalry from the Blind Auditions when Ariana had wanted to work with Holly so badly that she'd “maliciously held back” John by using her one Block of the season on him. Holly ended up picking Kelly at that time, but Ariana’s perseverance finally paid off this week. Sorry, John.WINNER: Girl Named Tom / STOLEN: Holly Forbes moves to Team Ariana.@hollyforbes & @GirlNamedTom's #VoiceKnockouts performances will have you saying ""WOW."" ✨ #TeamKelly — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/photo/81478822.cms,"Chrissy Teigen puts on leggy display in maxi skirt with thigh-high split posing with John Legend - Daily Mail

"SpaceX is 'go' to launch astronauts to space station on Halloween - Space.com
SpaceX is ""go"" to launch its spooky space station mission this weekend — as long as a toilet issue gets cleared up in time.No showstoppers were found during a flight readiness review (FRR) for the company's Crew-3 mission, which will send four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Crew-3 therefore remains on track to lift off early on Halloween morning (Oct. 31), NASA and SpaceX announced Monday (Oct. 25).""We had a good review today,"" Joel Montalbano, NASA's ISS program manager, said during a news conference Monday evening after the FRR wrapped up. The review revealed no surprises, Montalbano said. But that doesn't mean the NASA and SpaceX teams aren't working on any issues. Indeed, they need to resolve one outstanding item before Crew-3 can lift off — a slight redesign of .That tweak was prompted by an issue experienced on SpaceX's Inspiration4 mission, which sent four private citizens on a three-day trip to orbit last month. After that capsule, named Resilience, returned home, inspections revealed that a tube hooked up to a toilet storage tank had popped loose during flight. This ""allowed urine to not go into the storage tank but, essentially, to go into the fan system,"" Bill Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during Monday's news conference. But the leak didn't markedly affect Inspiration4, he added.""We didn't really even notice it; the crew didn't notice it until we got back"" to Earth, Gerstenmaier said.Still, SpaceX decided to revamp the toilet system on the Crew-3 capsule, known as Endurance, going with an all-welded structure to eliminate tube pop-offs, Gerstenmaier said. NASA needs to give the redesign a final thumbs-up before Crew-3 can fly, but that is expected to happen in the coming days.The toilet issue could potentially apply to another Crew Dragon: the capsule known as Endeavour, which flew SpaceX's Crew-2 mission and is still docked to the ISS. Endeavour is scheduled to come back to Earth with the four Crew-2 astronauts soon — on Nov. 4, if Crew-3 launches on time.Astronauts on the orbiting lab have examined Endeavour, looking for signs of corrosion caused by leaked urine (or rather, by an additive that SpaceX puts into the Crew Dragon septic system to remove ammonia from urine). They haven't found anything troublesome, and analyses by teams here on Earth indicate that all should be well for Crew-2's return, Gerstenmaier said.He also noted that leakage on Crew-2 was likely significantly lower than on Inspiration4, given that crewmembers used Endeavour's toilet only during its 24-hour trip to the space station rather than for three full days.—

All are spaceflight rookies except Marshburn, who has two visits to the station under his belt.Crew-3 will mark Endurance's spaceflight debut.

"The $1,800 Sony Xperia Pro-I phone has a one-inch camera sensor and a dual-aperture - CNET
For years, many of us have hoped for a phone with a truly amazing camera built around a large image sensor. In 2018, cinema camera maker  which ended up having a mid-tier Android camera system that could shoot 3D photos and videos. Now don't get me wrong, what Apple, Google, Huawei and Samsung have been able to do with tiny image sensors and computational photography is absolutely amazing. But you have to wonder: What if the iPhone, instead of having an image sensor that was 0.6 inches, had one that was one-inch? And that's where Sony enters the conversation with the Xperia Pro-I. It's basically a Sony Xperia 1 III phone with the sensor from a Sony RX100 VII camera.The middle camera with the large lens opening has a one-inch image sensor.What's amazing is that Sony was able to fit a one-inch sensor into a phone body that is roughly the same thickness as an iPhone 13 Pro Max. A larger sensor means a wider dynamic range and improved low-light performance for both photos and videos. But it turns out, that one-inch image sensor might not be fully used. The  that just 60% of the Xperia Pro-I's one-inch sensor is used for photos and videos. That means instead of taking 20-megapixel photos like the Sony RX100 VII, the Xperia Pro-I takes 12-megapixel photos. That's not necessarily a dealbreaker, but it's a definite bummer.Sony sent me a pre-production sample of the Xperia Pro-I to try. Photos and videos look good. Check out the hands-on video attached to this article to see video clips I shot using the Xperia Pro-I. I still have more testing and will do a full in-depth review once I can get a final production sample. All photos and videos I shot were taken with the main camera and its 24-millimeter lens or the ultrawide camera with its 16-millimeter lens. The 50-millimeter camera was disabled on the pre-production prototype.I like the way the Xperia Pro-I handles highlights and shadows in this photo of a trio of good doggies.The Xperia Pro-I doesn't apply too much sharpening.This isn't a great way to take a photo, but I wanted to test the Xperia Pro-I against some harsh backlighting and it did a decent job of protecting the details and highlights in skin tones.The dynamic range is good.Like other Xperia phones, the Pro-I doesn't have a dedicated night mode.Sony is not the only company to put a one-inch sensor into a phone. But the sensor in the Xperia Pro-I has been through seven generations of improvements and updates and combines the finesse of Sony's other phone photographic tools and apps.Like the Xperia 1 III, the Xperia Pro-I has Sony's Photo Pro and Cinema Pro apps. But, Sony wanted a better video option for those looking for something more advanced than basic video recording and something not as complicated as using the Cinema Pro app. With the Xperia Pro-I, Sony is launching a new app called Video Pro which is aimed at journalists, vloggers and the like.The top of the app has an Auto button that lets the phone make all the choices about shutter speed, ISO and white balance. But when you turn that off, you can manually control everything. You can switch between manual focus and autofocus and there is a slider which lets you zoom in and out while recording. You can switch the aperture from f/2 to f/4. You can reprogram the hardware buttons on the phone to trigger a shortcut in Video Pro like using the volume rocker to zoom-in and out.I couldn't get my hands on the new Sony vlogging monitor kit or a photo of it. So I recreated my own using a Post-It Note as the tiny magnetic monitor and a chain of paperclips as the cable that connects the monitor to the phone.The Xperia Pro-I works with . That's important because along with the Xperia Pro-I, Sony announced a $199 vlogging monitor kit which comes with a phone mount, a magnetic monitor and a tiny cable to connect the monitor and phone. The kit makes it so that you can film yourself with main rear camera and that one-inch sensor.The Xperia Pro-I has the same 4K 120Hz display, USB-C port and dedicated headphone jack as the Xperia 1 III. The Xperia Pro-I runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor and supports low and mid-band 5G. Sony still plans to sell the . The differentiator is it has a micro-HDMI port, 5G support for both sub-6 and mmWave here in the US.You can order the Sony Xperia Pro-I starting Oct. 28 and the phone ships Dec. 10. ",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/CD--n5H3ZX45pWRbbE01vjqa1VI=/84x84/2016/10/19/ccb7114f-6b74-49e4-845b-ebf6fee03eaa/patrickholland.jpg,"Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) Review: A Much-Needed Redesign - HYPEBEAST
Apple announced a long-awaited update to the AirPods at its Unleashed event earlier this month.The AirPods (3rd generation) — Apple’s first major redesign of its popular flagship wireless earbuds — introduces an entirely new look while also adding in great features like spatial audio and Adaptive EQ borrowed from the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, alongside longer battery life.Most striking is the new design of the AirPods, which offers a shorter stem and a larger earpiece that is less prone to slipping out of your ears during an intense running session (a longstanding gripe of AirPods users). The more snug fit also means the audio quality is less disturbed by the outside environment, making sounds more crisp and direct. To create the new contoured shape, Apple took thousands of ear scans and measurements, in-depth studies of acoustics and heat mapped modeling to create a lightweight and intentional earpiece that is optimized for comfort. The stem also features a force sensor — a feature of the AirPods Pro that users find intuitive — that allows for easier maneuvering between songs right from the buds. And the AirPods and its case now also have a greater sweat and water resistance rating of IPX4, just like the AirPods Pro.













Major enhancements have also been made to the audio quality — a feature that is crucial for a great pair of headphones. Apple has introduced a custom driver and high dynamic range amplifier to create richer bass and smooth high frequencies. The voice quality has been improved to optimize voice clarity during phone calls, with an inset microphone embedded in each earbud that is covered in a special acoustic mesh to reduce wind noise. In addition, they also feature AAC-ELD, a superior codec that allows for full-HD voice quality.
Fan-favorite spatial audio with dynamic head tracking has been added to the new AirPods, which uses advanced spatial audio algorithms to provide theatre-like sound. The result is rich and layered audio that sounds like it’s coming from all around you, definitely an upgrade most noticeable when watching movies, listening to music or when speaking on a group chat. The device utilizes a powerful H1 chip and employs Adaptive EQ to customize the listening experience for each user, while an inward-facing microphone has been added to each bud to listen to the sound emerging from the device and automatically tune the low-and-mid frequencies to the user’s ear shape in real-time.
In addition, Apple has expanded the device’s battery life with up to 6 hours of listening from a single charge — an hour upgrade from the previous generation — and has introduced MagSafe charging for the case for even more charging options.













And like the previous models, AirPods include delightful features like one-tap setup, in-ear detection using an all-new skin detect optical sensor, beamforming microphones, audio sharing, Siri and Find My built right into the device.
The AirPods (3rd generation) will be available for $179 USD in-store and online beginning Tuesday, October 26. The price of the AirPods (2nd generation) has also dropped to $129 USD while the AirPods Pro now comes with the MagSafe charging case for the same price of $249 USD.
Overall, it appears that Apple carefully crafted the new iteration of AirPods by utilizing some of the best features available in the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max while also giving the buds new hardware and a complete redesign. The result is both a great standalone product as well as a great addition to the full AirPods family lineup.

Yesterday@filipeespositoApple has finally released macOS Monterey to the public. The update comes with several new features, including Focus mode for notifications, SharePlay, Live Text, and more. Another new feature is the ability to AirPlay from an iPhone or iPad to a Mac without having to install any third-party apps, so read on as we detail how to use this feature.
AirPlay is a wireless protocol from Apple created to stream audio and video from one device to another, such as Apple TV or HomePod. Now with macOS Monterey, users can easily turn their Macs into AirPlay servers. In other words, you can play a song or even share your iPhone or iPad screen and stream it on your Mac.First of all, if you want to use AirPlay to Mac, you’ll need to have a compatible Mac. Not every Mac that can run macOS Monterey supports the new feature, so check the list below to see if your Mac can be used as an AirPlay server:AirPlay was officially introduced with iOS 4 years ago. However, only the devices listed below can transmit content in higher qualities and resolutions:In theory, once you have installed macOS Monterey on a supported Mac, there’s not much you need to AirPlay from an iOS device to your computer.On your iPhone or iPad, look for the AirPlay button in the Control Center or within supported apps. If you want to share the screen of your device over AirPlay, tap the Screen Mirroring toggle in the Control Center. Then select your Mac from the AirPlay list. The content should be wirelessly streamed to your computer after a few seconds.If for some reason AirPlay to Mac is not working or if you want to disable the feature, Apple provides an option to do this in the macOS settings. First, open the System Preferences app and then click on the Sharing option.Look for AirPlay Receiver in the service list. There, you can uncheck the box to disable AirPlay to Mac. There are also settings to restrict AirPlay only to other devices registered to your Apple ID or anyone on the same network. A password can also be set to enable AirPlay to Mac.It’s worth mentioning that AirPlay to Mac also works by wire using a USB cable. Apple says that using a cable is recommended for when you need low latency or if you don’t have access to a Wi-Fi network. For those who have AirPlay 2 compatible speakers, the Mac can also be used as another AirPlay 2 speaker to play songs or podcasts simultaneously with the multiroom audio option.",https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/AirPlay-iPhone-iPad-to-Mac.png,"Google Camera adds a color temperature slider on Pixel 6 series [Gallery] - 9to5Google
Yesterday@NexusBenThe revamped camera hardware on the Pixel 6 series delivers better overall shots that are stunning on their own and seem to  in big ways, but it doesn’t come down just to hardware. Alongside new motion features, the Pixel 6 also adds a color temperature slider to the Google Camera app.
Available on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, this new color temperature slider in the Google Camera app works alongside the contrast and brightness sliders on the other side of the interface. The slider, as you might expect, adjusts the color temperature of the scene to make it warmer or cooler to suit the shot you need.The effect can be rather dramatic at its highest levels, but it can help in adjusting the temperature in scenes that need it. As mentioned in our review, this is a feature I didn’t find necessary over the time I’ve had with the phone so far, but I’d imagine it might come in handy in harshly lit scenes such as parties where specialized colored lighting is in use.Notably, too, the codename for this feature is called “chameleon.” At this point in time, we’re not 100% sure if Google plans to bring this to other Pixel phones, as it may be tied to the new Tensor chip.Pixel 6 is shipping now from the Google Store and other major retailers.

In some instances, the M1 Max with 32 GPU cores has impressed thoroughly, and in others, not so much. On this occasion, a lead developer of the image editor Affinity Photo points out that Apple’s latest silicon beats the AMD Radeon Pro W6900X, which was the fastest GPU ever tested using the application and costs a whopping $6,000.According to Andy Somerfield, his Twitter thread highlights that Affinity Photo has been optimizing its program ever since Apple announced the M1 and he wanted to see how far the M1 Max has come in performance. Affinity Photo has developed its own benchmark suite with which it measures this performance, and it runs best when a GPU can deliver high bandwidth and compute performance.Previously, the Radeon Pro W6900X held the crown for the fastest GPU in Affinity Photo’s leaderboards, thanks to its 32GB GDDR6 onboard memory that could deliver 512GB/s of memory bandwidth. In comparison, the M1 Max with a 32-core GPU tops out at 400GB/s of memory bandwidth. Despite this difference, Apple’s top-end custom SoC outperforms the heavily expensive AMD solution, which also consumes roughly 300W and needs a separate slot to be put into.Coming to the numbers, the M1 Max scores 32891 in the Raster (Single GPU) test, while the AMD Radeon Pro W6900X barely trailed behind with a score of 32580. While this win goes to Apple, Somerfield points out that not every task will favor the M1 Max GPU, but these results show how the 2021 MacBook Pro models can be the go-to portable machine for editing images using Affinity Photo.So, with the upcoming delivery of new #M1Pro and #M1Max hardware to customers next week, I thought I’d spend a couple of days talking about how @affinitybyserif Photo uses GPUs, how our benchmark works and what we should reasonably expect from this new hardware 🙂 — Andy Somerfield (@andysomerfield) October 23, 2021Instances where the M1 Max GPU came up short, was in previous gaming benchmark results, where it barely beat a 70W laptop RTX 3060 and was . It also underperformed in the 8K Adobe Premiere Pro test, where it just managed to take the lead against the Surface Laptop Studio, which does not sport powerful specifications at all. However, since Premiere Pro is not optimized for Macs, you will see such results. If you really want to take advantage of all this hardware, run Final Cut Pro and see what figures you get.In fact, DaVinci Resolve boasts around  on the 2021 MacBook Pro models, so for certain programs, the M1 Max GPU will excel beyond your wildest expectations. Do remember to check out Andy Somerfield’s Twitter thread to know more about how the benchmark tests were done, and do not forget to share your thoughts down in the comments.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/317JZoz+AxL._SL160_.jpg
"‘Psychopath’ Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman Spoke of Killing King With Poison Ring From Russia - Yahoo News
A former top intelligence officer with Saudi Arabia’s elite intelligence team says he fears for his life because  wants him dead and will use his “Tiger Squad” of henchmen to do it.In a wide-ranging interview that aired Sunday on CBS’ 60 Minutes, Saad Aljabri, who was an adviser to former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, described bin Salman as a “psychopath with no empathy,” who “doesn’t feel emotion.”He told CBS News that he has seen a video in which bin Salman says he wanted to assassinate King Abdullah to pave the way for his own father—and eventually himself—to lead the kingdom. “We have witnessed atrocities and crimes committed by this killer,” Aljabri said, describing how the prince once said: “I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get poison ring from Russia—it’s enough for me just to shake hands with him and he will be done.”King Abdullah died in 2015 after a decade-long reign. His brother Salman was crowned king after his death; two years later, Salman removed bin Nayef and appointed his own son, known as MBS, as crown prince. A year later, MBS became an international pariah , a Saudi dissident and pointed critic of the kingdom.Aljabri left Saudi Arabia in 2017 after he was forced out of his job, fleeing with all but two of his eight children and his wife. While there, two of his children were imprisoned as they were preparing to leave for college in the U.S. He says he has not spoken to them since.Aljabri said he is also a target for the same sort of killing squad that lured Khashoggi to a Saudi consulate in Turkey, where he was murdered and dismembered. Canada stopped a similar team that arrived in Ottawa to kill Aljabri shortly after Khashoggi’s murder. “I expect to be killed one day because this guy will not rest until he [sees] me dead,” Aljabri said.The former spymaster filed a lawsuit in U.S. federal court in 2020, alleging the plot to kill him was real. “Like the team that murdered Khashoggi, those sent to kill Dr. Saad… were also members of defendant bin Salman’s personal mercenary group, the Tiger Squad,” the complaint reads. “Carrying two bags of forensic tools, and complete with forensic personnel experienced with the clean-up of crime scenes … the Tiger Squad defendants attempted to enter Canada covertly, traveling on tourist visas and seeking to avert the detection of Canadian border security by entering through separate kiosks.”CBS News asked the Saudi government for a response, which they provided. “Saad Aljabri is a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed,” they insist.The kingdom has called to dismiss the suit, alleging instead that Aljabri and his former colleagues stole and misspent $11 billion from its counterterrorism arm. Canada has frozen Aljabri’s assets as it investigates whether he personally took some $500 million. When CBS anchor Scott Pelley asked him if he took the money, he denied it. When pressed about why he was so wealthy, Aljabri said that he had worked for Saudi monarchs who were “nice” to him.Last week, it was reported that former President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was  for his private-equity firm from the MBS-controlled Public Investment Fund, according to Project Brazen, an outlet run by a group of Wall Street Journal investigative journalists.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZxhqYe2pShZpG4KiWNRMcg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTM5Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nuHh3Hld.AgURfEB2aHScw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/90974776877132945ac2a5abffee48c0,"Saudi Central Bank Mulls Blockchain for Finance, Rejects Phasing Out Cash: Report - CoinDesk
