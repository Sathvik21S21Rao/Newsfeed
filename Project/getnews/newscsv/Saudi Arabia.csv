"Djokovic, Medvedev win US Open men's semis, head to Sunday's final - Fox News
 Beating No. 2 Daniil Medvedev on Sunday for the title will allow Djokovic to secure two significant milestones. He would add the 2021 U.S. Open trophy to those he won at the Australian Open in February, French Open in June and Wimbledon in July. And the 34-year-old from Serbia would collect his 21st Slam title in all, breaking the men’s career mark he currently shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.""There’s only one match left. ... All in. Let’s do it,"" Djokovic said, spreading his arms wide, in an on-court interview. ""I’m going to put my heart and my soul and my body and my head into that one. I'm going to treat the next match like it is the last match of my career.""That key game against Zverev featured one extended exchange after another, including a 53-shot, minute-plus point that was the longest of the tournament and actually was lost by Djokovic. Zverev delivered a forehand winner, then hunched over with his hands on his knees. Djokovic went to grab a towel. Both men were breathing heavily as most of Arthur Ashe Stadium's 21,139 spectators rose in unison on a cool, crisp evening.

      But that one, tiny outcome didn't matter. Never seems to with Djokovic, especially in best-of-five-set matches on his sport's most prestigious stages. As usual, he used his superb returning and never-take-a-rest defense to wear down Zverev.""I’m proud of the fight that I delivered,"" Djokovic said.So, yes, Djokovic lost that point — which was preceded by others lasting 13, 19, 22 and 31 shots, and followed by one that went 16 — but he won that game, and that set with it. Just as he had lost the first set about 1 1/2 hours earlier but turned things around, with the help of a dip in level from the fourth-seeded Zverev. And just as, later, Djokovic lost the fourth set but immediately rebounded and was nearly untouchable while going ahead 5-0 in the fifth then held on.Djokovic, who has spent more weeks at No. 1 in the ATP rankings than anyone, figures out what is required to emerge on top and does it. In each of his past four matches — and 10 in all at the Slams this year — he trailed by a set and won.He equaled Federer by getting to a 31st career Slam final; Djokovic's total now includes a record nine in New York, where he has won three championships.It will be Slam final No. 3 for Medvedev, a 25-year-old from Russia, who eliminated 12th-seeded Felix Auger-Aliassime of Canada 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in the afternoon. Medvedev was defeated by Djokovic in this year's Australian Open final and by Nadal in the 2019 U.S. Open final.""The more you lose something, the more you want to win it. The more you want to gain it and take it,"" said Medvedev, who has lost only one set over the past two weeks. ""I lost two finals. I want to win the third one.""Djokovic is trying to go 4 for 4 at the majors over the course of one season, something last done in men's tennis by Rod Laver 52 years ago. It was also done by Laver in 1962 and Don Budge in 1938. Three women have completed what's known as a true Grand Slam, most recently Steffi Graf in 1988. Serena Williams' attempt in 2015 ended at the U.S. Open with a semifinal loss to Roberta Vinci.""I’ll be giving it all I possibly got in the tank to win this match. I’m focusing on recovery, recalibrating all the systems, basically, for Sunday,"" Djokovic said. ""I’m not going to waste time or energy on anything that can just be a distraction and deplete me from the vital energy that I need.""

      As Friday night's semifinal began, the 81-year-old Laver was seated front and center behind a baseline in the President’s Box at Ashe.A year ago in New York, when fans were banned because of the coronavirus pandemic, Zverev came oh-so-close to collecting his first major, taking a two-set lead and getting within two points of a championship before frittering it all away and losing to Dominic Thiem in a fifth-set tiebreaker.Zverev came into Friday on a 16-match winning streak, a run that includes beating Djokovic in the Summer Games semifinals on July 30. That was in a best-of-three-sets format, though, which changes everything when it comes to Djokovic. He is now 36-10 in matches that go five sets.Here’s the thing about Djokovic, who occasionally rubbed his lower back with his left hand or hit his legs with his racket: Whatever the outward signs seem to say, he never stresses and he waits for the other guy to slip.""It’s kind of a hurricane, a tornado, of emotions that you're going through in a sequence of one set or even one point. You are by yourself on the court, so there is no escape,"" Djokovic said. ""You’ve got to find a way.""He usually does.""Mentally, in the most important moments,"" Zverev said after his 3 1/2-hour loss, ""I would rather play against anybody but him.""Against Zverev, things really came alive six games and 20 minutes in, thanks to a terrific 24-stroke point in which Djokovic tried a drop shot. Zverev got to it, replied at a seemingly impossible angle and — after Djokovic sprinted wide of the doubles alley and stretched to retrieve that, sneakers squeaking all the way — came up with a winner.The crowd went wild. Zverev raised his right hand and wagged his fingers: ""Louder!"" Soon enough, Djokovic was shaking a ball off his frame and into the seats, and the set was Zverev's.Zverev went from six unforced errors in that set to 13 in the second, and the match was even.In the third, some loose play by Djokovic, and a backhand passing winner by Zverev, created a pair of break points. But Djokovic saved them and held to 3-2 with a forehand that clipped the baseline.Zverev put a hand on his hip, disagreeing that the ball was in, but there is no recourse at the U.S. Open this year: All rulings come via electronic line-calling and can’t be disputed. There are no line judges to doubt or to argue with.Last year, there were, and Djokovic was disqualified from Flushing Meadows in the fourth round when a ball he hit after losing a game inadvertently struck a line judge in the throat. At the following major tournament, the pandemic-delayed French Open, Djokovic lost in the final to Nadal.Since then, there have been deficits in Grand Slam matches for Djokovic, but no defeats.""It’s great for the sport,"" Zverev said about Djokovic's pursuit. ""Nobody thought that anybody would do it again. ... I do believe that he will do it.""",https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/a6d2c06f-f57d-4b13-9f67-f0e95421e2fa/ee0d832a-668c-4a05-b43c-84e614a30c01/1280x720/match/931/524/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,"6 takeaways from Cam Newton's tell-all video following release from Patriots - Patriots Wire
Cam Newton is one of the most open and honest players to ever touch an NFL field.Whether the situation is positive or negative, he’s going to express himself. The 32-year-old made sure to vent following his release from the New England Patriots last week. Newton dropped a 43-minute video on Friday morning to discuss the past couple months with the Patriots, while being interviewed by his father, Cecil.Newton touched on topics ranging from his relationship with Mac Jones, the COVID situation that sidelined him for five days and his future in the NFL.Here’s some of the major takeaways from Newton’s tell-all video.Similar to everyone, Newton was surprised by the release.“Did it catch me by surprise, being released? Absolutely,” Newton said after being asked the question by his father.“I’ve been playing long enough to have got it remotely two years ago with the Panthers, but I never really got that call where, ‘Hey, come to the office,’ ” Newton said. “It was funny, as a matter of fact, to me. I’m laughing at it now. I walked in, and they were like, ‘Oh, hold up, Cam, Cam, Cam. Bill wants to meet with you.’ I’m like, ‘OK, cool.’ But Bill’s office is down here, and they were like, ‘No, he’s in here.’ And that’s when I’m like, ‘Oh, OK, I see what’s going on.’“When it happened, we went through the meeting, Matt Patricia was there, Bill was there. We greeted each other, and we just started talking. At that time, they told me that they were going to give the reins to Mac, and I was like, ‘OK, cool.’ And it didn’t dawn on me. I was like, ‘Y’all releasing me?’ I was confused, because Bill was — we all were shocked. It was uncomfortable for everybody.”The COVID situation that sidelined Newton for five days appeared to come out of nowhere. It also appeared to be framed as if it were Newton’s fault for being irresponsible ahead of the Patriots’ third preseason game.Here’s the Patriots’ statement on it.“On Saturday, Cam Newton traveled to a club-approved medical appointment that required him to leave the New England area,” the statement read. “He received daily COVID tests, which were all negative. Due to a misunderstanding about tests conducted away from NFL facilities, and as required by the NFL-NFLPA protocols, Cam will be subject to the five-day entry cadence process before returning to the facility. Cam will continue participating virtually in team activities and return to the club facility on Thursday, August 26.”Newton followed up with his side of the story.“Let’s go backwards to being away from the team for those five days: They gave me clearance to go,” Newton said, transcribed by WEEI. “So, I don’t want nobody to think they I just went. I’m owed a second opinion. That’s just a fact. The trip was necessary because this was the last time I felt that I was going to have an opportunity to get a second opinion.Not to say the personnel with the Patriots wasn’t coherent to telling me everything I needed to know, but having four eyes on it is better than having two eyes on it — in my opinion. It wasn’t that I was having any issues or pain, I just wanted to do a check-up with in essence the person who diagnosed me with the Lisfranc. I felt obligated to check back in with like a six-month review, or …“I crossed all the lines. I checked all the boxes. I dotted all my I’s and then to find out that I had to sit out, that’s when I kind of felt bamboozled because I’m like, ‘Y’all told me to go.’ It wasn’t like, ‘Cam, you know if you go you’re taking your own risk now.’ It was not that.” Despite what could be perceived to be bad blood between Newton and the Patriots, he still believes Jones will lead the team to wins. Newton didn’t seem to carry any resentment throughout the entire interview with his father.“They’re going to win football games with Mac Jones,” Newton said.His dad asked if the Patriots would win with Newton at the helm and he confidently responded.“That’s a fact, too,” he said. “But, I don’t want the audience to think he’s only saying that just because he’s not there no more. No, like Mac is good enough. I think when they selected him the selection that they picked him, they wanted to find out a couple of things. One of those things they wanted to find out was is he capable of leading this offense to be productive?”There was speculation stirring about his release saying a myriad of different scenarios caused it. Newton clearly believes that it was due to the fact that he’d be a distraction as Jones’ backup.“The reason that they released me was because indirectly, I was going to be a distraction without being the starter. … Just my aura. That’s my gift and my curse,” Newton said. “When you bring a Cam Newton into your facility, when you bring a Cam Newton to your franchise, people are interested by mere factor of who is he. Why does he wear his hair, why does he talk, why does he act, why does he perform? All these questions. …“So let me be honest with you. If they asked me, would I play behind — they say, ‘Cam, we’re going to give the team to Mac. You’re going to be the second string, and we expect you to be everything and some to guide him throughout this tenure.’ I would have said, ‘Absolutely.’ But listen, the truth of the matter is this: He would have been uncomfortable.”Rob Ninkovich went on a limb by . Newton had the entire 2020 season to learn it and Jones had his own growth to work through in five months since he was drafted.While being asked about it by his father, Newton replied with grace.“No,” Newton said. “How can he teach me?”He did admit the playbook was slightly different than anything he’s been used to, but that didn’t mean Jones was teaching him it.“Nah. If anything, I was — I was like, ‘Josh, it’s so new to me.’ I’ve never been in a system that required me to know where the Mike (linebacker) is, to know the front, to identify certain fronts and XYZ,” Newton said. “You can’t say that that’s stupid or ‘Why wouldn’t you know that?’ because half of the NFL — I would say 30 teams out of 32 teams don’t run this philosophy. It’s in the center’s call, because they control the protection, and if you have any type of red flag or an alert, then that’s when you kind of (say), ‘Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, Lucy this. Ricky to 50.’ You know what I’m saying? Something like that.“But as far as that? No. Mac was cool, man. He was a person who was young. He was still trying to find his way. And that’s why I would just say what can he teach me when it’s coming at him faster than it was coming at me? I would always ask Mac, and we were helping each other. It’s like, ‘You straight, bro?’ And I would go to (Brian Hoyer) and be like, ‘Bro, you seeing something that I didn’t see?’ or ‘What was the Mike?’ or XYZ. And then me and Josh had a great dialogue after practice or during practice where he would tell me. But I felt heads and toes above where I was understanding (the offense) 12 months ago. Without a doubt.”All this led to the question — is Newton going to retire at the age of 32?He prefaced the interview by saying it wasn’t a retirement speech and he backed that sentiment up at the end. Newton still believes there aren’t 32 quarterbacks better than him in the NFL.He is waiting for the right moment and won’t push the envelope, but there is still football in Newton’s future.“Do I have a lot of football left in me yet? Absolutely,” Newton finished the interview with. The Dolphins aren't a cupcake matchup for the Patriots in Week 1.If the Patriots want a successful season, these guys need to perform.Start every day with our most popular content waiting in your inbox.",https://patriotswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2020/12/USATSI_15340138.jpg?w=100&h=60&crop=1,"Jaylon Smith, Leighton Vander Esch were odd linebackers out for Cowboys - NBC Sports
The Buccaneers ran 64 plays Thursday night. The Cowboys gave their five linebackers 131 snaps, but they weren’t evenly distributed.Rookie Micah Parsons was on the field for 51 snaps, and free agent signee Keanu Neal played 50.That didn’t leave many snaps for anyone else, with Parsons and Neal serving as the primary nickel linebackers.Jaylon Smith played 16 and Leighton Vander Esch 14. Jabril Cox didn’t see action on defense.“I think they understand if you look at the big picture,” coach Mike McCarthy said of Smith and Vander Esch, via Mark Lane of WFAA. “We took 24 defensive players into the game. We had projections of how we wanted to play guys, and we knew it was going to be a challenge with the climate and the humidity. I think we really hit the target as far as getting the distribution of playing all the guys on defense. So, yeah, personally, I can’t speak on their behalf. If they weren’t frustrated, I’d be disappointed. These guys have played a lot of football throughout their whole career. It’s our focus to be better as a whole as a defense and frankly the more players you play, the better off you’re going to be.”Smith, a former second-round choice who counts $9.8 million against the cap this season, played 97.8 percent of the team’s defensive snaps last season. Vander Esch, a former first-round choice who is making $3.77 million in the final year of his deal, played only 10 games last season. Still, he played 42 percent of the defensive snaps for the season.Both players could get a fresh start somewhere else next season. The Cowboys declined Vander Esch’s fifth-year option. Smith has no guaranteed money left on his deal and is scheduled to count $11.8 million against the 2022 cap.Parsons, the team’s first-round choice this spring, is the big man on campus now. He totaled seven tackles, a pass breakup and a quarterback hit against the Bucs.“I thought it was a good start for him,” McCarthy said. “I think he’s beyond his years. He’s still a rookie. It was the first time he played in an NFL game and also the communication responsibility he has to handle. That’s a new experience. I don’t care where you played or how much time you get in the preseason. I thought he got off to a good start.”",https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2021/09/GettyImages-1183049758-e1631325439543.jpg?w=560&h=286&crop=1,"Fantasy Football Rankings Week 1, 2021: Model that beat experts says start Trevor Lawrence, sit Justin Herbert - CBSSports.com
When it comes to setting your Week 1 Fantasy football lineups, the decision to start a rookie quarterback in his first real NFL action can be a dicey one. Joe Burrow finished as the 20th quarterback in the first start of his pro career, while Justin Herbert was 13th when he debuted in Week 2 a season ago. A reliable set of Week 1 Fantasy football rankings can help to make the call on whether to start a young gun over a veteran passer.This week, four rookie quarterbacks are likely to make their debuts. Will Mac Jones shine as the top dog in New England, and can you trust him in your Fantasy football QB rankings? How viable of a threat is Trey Lance as a fantasy option in San Francisco? Before you lock in your lineups, be sure to .When it comes to ranking players, SportsLine's model beat human experts in Fantasy football for the past several seasons especially when there were big difference in ranking. Over the course of a season, that could literally be the difference between winning your league or going home empty-handed.Last year, the model accurately predicted that Bills quarterback Josh Allen was being drastically undervalued. His Fantasy football ADP was barely in the top 70, but the model pegged him as a top-five Fantasy quarterback, a QB1 who would finish well ahead of players like Kyler Murray, Tom Brady and Drew Brees. Allen ended up being the No. 2-scoring Fantasy QB, outscoring all three of those other quarterbacks and even surpassing Patrick Mahomes. Fantasy players who followed SportsLine's advice reaped plenty of value with that pick. Now, the model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, has revealed its Fantasy football rankings for Week 1 of the 2021 NFL season. .One player the model is extremely high on this week: Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence. The top prospect in years is up against a Houston Texans side that many presume will be the league's worst team in 2021. After mixed results in his first two preseason games, he torched the Dallas Cowboys, completing 11 of his 12 passes for 139 yards and two touchdowns.Houston traded starting cornerback Bradley Roby to the New Orleans Saints. Meanwhile, three defensive starters in Houston's front seven were all limited in practice this week. Lawrence has ascended to fifth in SportsLine's Week 1 Fantasy football quarterback rankings and is poised to throw darts all over the field against the Texans.A massive shocker: Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who threw for 4,336 yards and 31 touchdowns last season, stumbles big-time and barely cracks the top 15 at his position. Herbert had an impressive rookie season, averaging 25.5 Fantasy points per game. However, Herbert could be dealing with rust after not playing in the preseason and a matchup against the Washington Football Team won't do him any favors.Washington's defense gave up just 191.8 passing yards per game last season, which ranked second in the NFL. In addition, Washington recorded 47 total sacks in 2020. With such a tough matchup on Sunday, Herbert is a player to consider putting on the bench in Week 1.The model is also calling for a surprising quarterback you aren't even thinking about to finish in the top 10 of its Fantasy football rankings. This pick could be the difference between winning big and going home with nothing. .So who should you start and sit this week?

"El Salvador's Bitcoin detractors: Opposition groups gather as crypto law rolls out - Cointelegraph
The year 2021 will probably go down the history books as one of Bitcoin’s (BTC) most interesting years, given its recent uptake by billionaires and adoption by mainstream institutions, not to mention El Salvador’s move to make it legal tender. In El Salvador’s case, it almost seems as if the whole world is watching this experiment to see whether it will be a success or a total failure for the Central American nation.With Sept. 7 marking the official implementation of Bitcoin as a legal tender in El Salvador, a wave of protests in the country against the move has roused suspicions and uncertainty over how the new law will be enforced. From the arrest of individuals criticizing the Salvadoran government over the new law, to the wave of citizens across the country protesting Bitcoin’s legal status, the seminal crypto is facing some headwinds.It all began in early June after Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele announced in a tweet that the country’s legislative assembly had  The law was set to be implemented on Sept. 7 and would see the country's 4.5 million citizens able to make purchases with Bitcoin at stores nationwide. In his announcement, Bukele said that once an official bill to make Bitcoin legal tender was passed, “Chivo ATMs” — Chivo being the name of the official BTC wallet for El Salvador — would eventually be “everywhere” in the country. This would allow El Salvadorans to withdraw Bitcoin in cash without incurring any commissions on their holdings, as is the case with services such as Western Union. Moreover, Bukele assured citizens that no one will be forced to use Bitcoin. In a statement, the 40-year-old president said that “someone can always queue up at Western Union and pay a commission.”“What if someone doesn’t want to use Bitcoin? [Well] don’t download the app and continue living your normal life. Nobody is going to take your dollars,” he said. Following the announcement, a group of protestors called the Popular Resistance and Rebellion Block (BRRP) block emerged to protest against the Bitcoin law.“President Nayib Bukele passed the law making the cryptocurrency legal tender in the country without proper consultations with the people,” one activist said.Although the protest group highlighted complexities such as Bitcoin’s volatility as reasons for caution, their main claim is that the law mainly serves large businesses linked to alleged money laundering to the benefit of corrupt officials.“Bitcoin only serves some large businessmen, especially those linked to the government, to launder ill-gotten money,” one protestor said.A letter from the BRRP group said that “entrepreneurs who put their capital in Bitcoin will not pay taxes on their earnings and the government would spend millions worth of taxes to execute the whole campaign.”Indeed, the bill to make Bitcoin legal tender  such as a zero capital gains tax on BTC. The bill also promised investors permanent residency in the country with a three BTC investment in El Salvador. As the controversial Bitcoin bill became a law on Sept. 7, both supporters and detractors continue to emerge with the latest in events around the law being the arrest of Mario Gómez.According to several local news outlets in El Salvador, Mario Gómez — a computer and crypto expert as well as an avid critic of the government — was arrested by local police and held for a few hours before being released.Gómez has been known to regularly post on social media opposing the government’s move to make Bitcoin legal tender. Observers such as Steve Hanke — an economist from Johns Hopkins University — criticized Gómez's arrest as an “authoritarian police tactic in action.”Hector Silva, a counselor of the mayor’s office in San Salvador, said, “the arrest of Mario portrays the fragility of the government in terms of the implementation of the Bitcoin law but confirms something even more dangerous.”“They are willing to manipulate whatever institutions are necessary to push critical voices out of the way,” added Silva. Although the police released a statement saying that Gómez was detained as part of a financial fraud investigation, news reports claimed that he was arrested without a warrant and an attempt was made to take possession of his phone and computer. Right before Gómez's arrest, some retirees in El Salvador took to the streets to protest, worried about the government using the cryptocurrency to pay their pensions.While speaking to reporters, one demonstrator from the crowd — which included veterans, disability pensioners, workers and retirees — said, “we know this coin fluctuates drastically. Its value changes from one second to another, and we will have no control over it.”While Bukele has promised that the use of Bitcoin in the country will be optional and that salaries and pensions will still be paid in United States dollars, the protestors still highlighted a lack of knowledge of the technology.Citizens have also complained that there has been too little explanation from officials about the pros and cons of Bitcoin. “We don’t know the currency. We don’t know where it comes from. We don’t know if it’s going to bring us profit or loss. We don’t know anything,” one Salvadoran added. In response, Bukele’s administration has stated that the use of Bitcoin is not mandatory and that necessary training and other alternatives to Bitcoin will be provided. Although President Bukele enjoys incredibly high approval ratings, recent polls concerning the Bitcoin law show a widespread lack of support for the measure. A recent poll conducted by El Salvador's Universidad Centroamericana José Siméon Cañas shows that up to two-thirds of respondents are inclined toward a move to repeal the law, and more than 70% prefer the U.S dollar over Bitcoin.International institutions like the International Monetary Fund have also warned about macroeconomic, financial and legal issues brought about by El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin.Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Amherst Pierpont, said that “the plans for Bitcoin under an increasingly autocratic regime will likely only compound concerns about corruption.”On the flip side, others remain optimistic that the new law will eventually benefit Salvadorans given that the country’s economy is heavily reliant on remittances sent home by migrants overseas. Last year alone, the country’s remittances totaled $6 billion, accounting for a fifth of gross domestic product.“El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender by law offers the country some optionality in financial matters and sovereignty,” said Alexander Blum, managing director of Two Prime. His sentiments were echoed by Alberto Echegaray Guevara — an artist and entrepreneur — who said, “President Bukele’s Bitcoin Law is not only trying to make international money transfer cheaper and easier for 70% of his unbanked population but also creating a new economic hub and new remittances platform in Central America.”Adrian Pollard from HollaEx told Cointelegraph, “It is typical for new technology rollouts to have bugs and apposition but that’s exactly why it was made voluntary.”“I suspect there will be more bumps along the road for El Salvador but it will be worth it long term. In fact, I believe other South American nations aren’t far behind and will follow,” added Pollard.",https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/1434_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS91cGxvYWRzLzIwMjEtMDkvMzczZjNkMjMtMTExMS00NTEwLWEwNDgtZWQyNmMwN2JhMjhmLmpwZw==.jpg,"9/11 Radically Transformed Wall Street And Lower Manhattan - NPR

Wick Simmons, the former CEO of Nasdaq, started working on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan after graduating from business school in 1966. Today, he barely recognizes the neighborhood.""Wall Street, as I knew it, is gone,"" Simmons says.For centuries, Wall Street was the home of the the biggest banks in the world. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11 completely changed that as many executives questioned the wisdom of having an entire industry consolidated in one place.And soon after, many banks and financial services firms pulled up stakes. Some of them moved to other New York City neighborhoods, while others decamped for Connecticut and New Jersey. Simmons himself decided to move Nasdaq's staff to Times Square, which is now home to the exchange's global headquarters. Facing an exodus, developers and city officials decided to reimagine and reinvent Lower Manhattan. They envisioned a district that would attract residents and new businesses. It was to be be anchored by a gleaming tower that would be part of the new World Trade Center complex, along with a transit hub designed by famous architect Santiago Calatrava.It worked.
                New York Mayor's office released this view of proposed improvements to Water Street in Lower Manhattan on Dec. 12, 2002. The area around Wall Street has reinvented itself, with more non-financial companies pouring in and residential buildings going up.

On a rainy September morning, Wall Street was bustling. Yes, there were traders and bankers in suits, darting down the cobblestones in front of the iconic New York Stock Exchange building.But these financial workers were outnumbered by parents with kids, making their way to school. There are now more than two times as many apartments and condominiums as there were before Sept. 11, according to data from the Alliance for Downtown, a local business trade group.Jonathan Corpina, who has been a trader in Wall Street for 23 years and is now a senior managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners, still marvels at the changes.""This area down here has become a very hot area from a residential point of view,"" Corpina says, pointing out buildings that were previously anchored by banks but have been repurposed by developers.It's a far cry from what it used to be.""It was all business down here,"" Corpina says. ""And then, at 4:30 p.m., everyone would just go away, and go back home to wherever they lived.

The professional nature of Wall Street has also changed.Before 9/11, almost half of the jobs here were in finance, insurance, and real estate, according to the Alliance for Downtown. As of last year, it was a smaller proportion: roughly a third of them. Dino Fusco, the COO at Silverstein Properties, a major real estate developer responsible for much of the World Trade Center complex, acknowledges the changes.""There are fewer folks dressed like financial services executives, and many more individuals that are with the tech companies, media companies, and advertising companies,"" he says. Many of them are located in Silverstein Properties buildings, including Spotify and Uber. Condé Nast is headquartered in One World Trade Center, the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.  Yet some Wall Street long-timers miss the old neighborhood.Fred Price was a principal and founding partner at Sandler O'Neill when the attacks happened. Price's offices were on the 104th floor of World Trade Center's South Tower, and he lost more than 60 colleagues that day. The firm had been based in the Wall Street neighborhood since 1988, but Price and his colleagues on the executive committee decided it was time to move. Today, the firm – now known as Piper Sandler – is in Midtown, not far from Barclays and JPMorgan Chase.Price, a managing director at Piper Sandler, acknowledges post-9/11 moves have changed Wall Street.""When you landed yourself in that southern tip of Manhattan, you knew that you and everybody else were kind of doing the same thing,"" he recalls. ""You were all in the financial services business of some kind.""

Still, not every financial firm decided to move out of the neighborhood.Ken Chenault, then the chairman and CEO of American Express, says a significant number of his colleagues wanted to move to another part of the city, or even out of New York altogether.But to Chenault, the past was important: American Express has been based in Lower Manhattan since the 1850s. And he decided he wanted to be part of Wall Street's future, even if it would be drastically different from what he knew.""I felt strongly that American Express could play an important role in the revitalization of Downtown New York,"" he says.So American Express returned to its building on Vesey Street, across from One World Trade Center, back to the neighborhood it has called home for over a century.",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/09/10/gettyimages-1337337287-bcee19b25389ceac48adad077988809fa71b44d0-s1100-c50.jpg,"The next fast-food chicken sandwich war may be a vegan one - CNBC
In an iconic scene from 1970's film ""Five Easy Pieces,"" a young Jack Nicholson orders a chicken sandwich without the chicken.The waitress is incredulous. ""You want me to hold the chicken?"" she retorts.Half a century later, this nix-the-chicken request would hardly register an eye-roll. While the chicken sandwich war that kicked off back in summer 2018 between Popeye's and Chick-fil-A has not reached an official cease-fire, and has spread to additional fast food giants, a new contender is poised to slay its competitors on the battlefield: a chicken sandwich that, well, holds the chicken.Could a vegan chicken sandwich war be on the way? Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have both recently added plant-based chicken options for restaurants and grocery stores — just this week, ; in July,  for restaurants after an earlier effort to sell frozen nuggets in grocery stores ended in failure.If the local vegan fast-food scene around the U.S. is any indication, the idea may yet makes its way up the national food chain.During the past year, Texans who pull into a familiar fast-food drive-thru craving a fried chicken sandwich might instead encounter a Project Pollo, a new quick serve chain that serves soy-based fried ""Chikn"" sandwiches and other plant-based comfort foods such as mac and cheese, wings and burgers. Since launching as a food cart at a San Antonio brewery in September 2020,  its fledging empire with phenomenal speed, launching a new location roughly every month. When the company recently announced on Instagram that it would be taking over defunct Whataburgers in Houston and Corpus Christi in the coming fall, a growing cult following with handles like @vegan_dad_bod_killer and @nosh.on.plants erupted in jubilant emojis.Every shuttered traditional fast-food outlet that relaunches as a Project Pollo, from a Church's Fried Chicken to a Jack in the Box, represents a single victory in CEO Lucas Bradbury's grand strategy: 100 locations by 2024. In the quest for world, or at least national, domination, Bradbury — who grew up as a Kansas farm boy raising chickens and cattle and went on to work in many fast-food industry executive positions —  entirely within the next two decades.Bradbury, who drained his bank accounts and sold his house to finance the first Project Pollo — with a new baby, and in the middle of a pandemic, no less — admitted he was operating without a Plan B, only the mission of making vegan food available to everyone. His entrepreneurial lightbulb moment occurred in the first months of the pandemic, when he challenged his extended family — his wife is already vegan — to go vegan for 30 days. They didn't meet the target, he admits, but not for lack of desire: it was simply too expensive to dine out while eating a plant-based diet.The rising cost of a plant-based diet is a typical stumbling block for the average American, he tells CNBC. ""The only way to challenge the system is for plant-based eating to be more approachable."" in July, ""This isn't a fried piece of tofu. This is the future of chicken.""A Chick-fil-A spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company didn't ""have anything to share right now on this topic,"" but added it is always exploring new options for the menu and does already include vegetarian items such as salads.As vegan upstarts appear in former fast-food franchises, analysts say there is reason to expect the fast-food chicken war will have a zero-cluck wave?Overall,  over the past two years, according to Darren Seifer, an industry analyst who tracks food and beverage trends for the NPD Group. Shipments of plant-based proteins from foodservice distributors to commercial restaurants increased by over 60% in April 2021 year over year, a rise accentuated by pandemic restrictions a year ago. Shipments are up over 16% compared to April 2019, according to NPD. Its data shows that plant-based chicken, specifically, grew by over 82% in April compared to a year ago, and over 25% compared to April 2019. It isn't about catering to a vegan demographic — 90% of consumers who experiment with plant-based meat alternatives also eat meat and dairy. ""It's about every once and awhile making a healthier decision,"" Seifer said.In comparison to the 30% of consumers who gravitate towards meat alternatives due to concerns over animal welfare, the No. 1 motivator for those who choose plant-based foods is doing something healthier, Seifer said. And given that most consumers who might occasionally eat a plant-based meat products don't identify as vegan or vegetarian, he added that it's no surprise that the term ""vegan"" is not always used in product marketing.In addition to health concerns, sustainably minded younger customers are driving the meatless trend. ""When we're talking about things like meat alternatives, 40% of people say they are drawn to environmental and sustainability concerns,"" he said. ""And the younger you go, the greater the numbers.""Among the national fast-food chains, chicken still rules the roost: Yum Brands' KFC posted recent sales growth that surpassed Taco Bell and Pizza Hut — its  After KFC and McDonald's both released new chicken sandwiches in February, fast food CEOs suggested that . In fact, KFC is on the rebound, opening 428 net new locations in 62 countries during the second quarter. In April, KFC  compared with past versions.With more than 400 locations in Texas alone, Chick-fil-A remains the largest quick-serve chicken restaurant in the country, according to the QSR 50, an annual report that tracks the fast-food sector. Even with aggressive competition, the brand recently garnered 41% of all sales on chicken sandwiches through food delivery apps, according to a report by Edison Trends.Still, as legacy fast-food brands vie for market share by rolling out increasing elaborate chicken sandwiches (brioche bun, herbed mayo, artisanal pickles) . That means soaring demand hindered by supply shortages, according to Seifer.Not only is chicken trickier to procure, but it is also . According to U.S. government data, the  year over year between July 2020 and July 2021. Those pressures could make more plant-based chicken alternatives an attractive option.Still, legacy fast-food brands have been slow to deliver meatless chicken sandwiches. That's not for lack of R & D: in 2019, KFC began collaborating with veggie brands like Beyond Meat and Quorn, piloting the Zero Chicken sandwich in the U.K., the Netherlands and Singapore. Stateside, the brand has tested Beyond Fried Chicken in local markets in the south and California in 2019 and 2020, but a nationwide U.S. launch for plant-based chicken is yet to happen.A KFC spokeswoman said in a statement that it is continuing to evaluate the results of those tests and discuss potential plans for a future national rollout of Beyond Fried Chicken, but it has never tested a plant-based chicken sandwich in the U.S.Beyond Meat noted in an email to CNBC that its chicken tenders, based on the Faba bean, came out just as restaurants were experiencing shortages and price hikes on the supply side and consumer demand was skyrocketing. It added that a few restaurant companies, Dog Haus and plant-based chain Next Level Burger, already are offering the tenders within sandwich menu items.As chicken prices rise and more Americans embrace a ""flexitarian"" eating style, meatless quick-serve restaurants that make their own proprietary plant-based chicken analogues may be poised to make big profits. For example, the soy-based ""chickn"" that Bradbury ships directly from Taiwan cuts costs, circumventing the need for suppliers like Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods, and keeps the price point reasonable.His commitment to make vegan food available to the widest audience possible has been a core mission of Project Pollo since day one, when it launched the first menu item, the pay-what-you-can Project Pollo sandwich. The suggested price, $5.50, covers the cost of sandwiches for two other customers in a pay-it-forward gesture of community goodwill. Astoundingly, 90% of customers not only pay the suggested price, ""but actually pay more,"" Bradbury said. Every quarter, Project Pollo adds up the profits on these sandwiches to make a donation to one of the many animal charities it supports.As the price of actual chicken has risen, and Project Pollo staffing and operations capacity increase to open more than twenty locations in the coming year, Bradbury remains committed to keeping his prices affordable. ""If anything, our prices will come down,"" he said. Average sandwich prices on Project Pollo's menu are $7 to $8.Across the country, vegan quick-serve outlets are cutting out the middleman and keeping their carbon footprint low by making their own plant-based ""chicken"" in-house.On a warm summer afternoon in Minneapolis, the smell of fried goodness wafted through the air as dozens of people lined up down a row of brick storefronts for the grand opening of Herbie V's Fried Chicken. Launched by Kale and Aubry Walch — a brother-sister duo who opened the Herbivorous Butcher, the nation's first vegan butcher shop in 2016. (The Walch siblings recently won a protracted legal battle with food giant Nestle over the trademark The Vegan Butcher.)The all-vegan fast casual cafe features the kind of comfort foods normally eschewed by strict herbivores. Think fried chicken, fries, and malts in flavors like Strawberry Shortcake. (The apparent secret to the creamy, dairy-free malts: oat-milk ice cream.) Despite embracing the term ""vegan"" in their offerings, Kale Walch — like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods' executives, and Project Pollo's Bradbury — hope ""to bridge the gap between the plant-based and the omnivore communities"" rather than cater to a specifically vegan demographic.Walch's lack of formal culinary training didn't deter him from embarking on ""a crusade for a better chicken recipe"" as he experimented in his butcher shop with ""a hundred different things,"" finally winding up with a soy-based product that harnesses the secret ingredients of vegan buttermilk, apple cider vinegar and a blend of herbs. ""There was a lot of time for R & D because of the pandemic,"" he said.The new cache of local vegan influencers should not be underestimated. At the Slutty Vegan in Atlanta, you might spot athletes like Shaquille O'Neal and Colin Kaepernick, along with musical icons such as Common and Snoop Dogg, queueing up for a taste of the Chik'n Head sandwich, a plant-based chicken tossed in buffalo sauce, slathered with vegan ranch and coleslaw on a Hawaiian bun. Rounding out their menu is plant-based burgers and sandwiches with blush-inducing names like One Night Stand and Hollywood Hooker.""Most of our consumers are meat eaters,"" said Pinky Cole, CEO of The Slutty Vegan, by email. ""My core audience is meat eaters. I'm intentional about that. We're not here to pressure anyone to commit to a full vegan diet; we want to show them that eating plant-based doesn't have to be boring or unappealing,"" Cole insisted, ""We make veganism cool.""Ultimately, the line never lies. ""All of our locations have a line down a block. That tells me that obviously we're doing something right,"" Cole said.",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"Arizona sells Unilever bonds over Ben & Jerry’s Israel sales ban - New York Post
Arizona has sold off $93 million in Unilever bonds and plans to sell the remaining $50 million it has invested in the global consumer products company over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision , the latest in a series of actions by states with anti-Israel boycott laws.The investment moves state  were mandated by a 2019 state law that bars Arizona government agencies from holding investments or doing more than $100,000 in business with any firm that boycotts Israel or its territories.Arizona appears to be the first of 35 states with anti-boycott laws or regulation to have fully divested itself from Unilever following Ben & Jerry’s actions. Illinois warned the company in July that it had 90 days after its investment board met to change course or it too would sell. Florida and other states have taken similar action, according to IAC For Action, the policy and legislative arm for the Israeli-American Council.While Ben & Jerry’s, which is based in Vermont, is owned by London-based Unilever, it maintains its own independent board, which Unilever said makes its own decision on its social mission. Ben & Jerry’s announced on July 19 that maintaining its presence in the occupied territories was Ben & Jerry’s decision , which vowed to “act aggressively” in response to the move, including by urging U.S. governors to punish the company under anti-boycott laws. Arizona and 34 other states have laws against boycotts of Israel.U.S. groups that support Israel are split on whether pushing back on Unilever for Ben & Jerry’s decision is appropriate. The Israeli-American Council urged governors to act through IAC For Action.IAC for Action Director Joseph Sabag called boycotts of Israel antisemitic and said it is important to fight them at the state level.“The Israeli American community is sensitive to it, because I would say more than other parts of the Jewish American community, we experienced the national origin aspect of antisemitism in a more pronounced way,” Sabag said Friday. “That’s really why we’re very proactive. It’s our children who are being affected by this in the classrooms and are being made fearful and intimidated and to feel harassed. … That’s definitely what our community’s interest is in the matter.′But the head of J Street, a Washington, D.C.-based pro-Israel organization that backs a two-state solution,  and said punishing the company is “gravely dangerous.”“It’s not anti-semitic to criticize Israeli policy or to not sell ice cream in illegal settlements,” . “It’s actually a truly pro-Israel decision.”The anti-boycott laws face court challenges, as Arizona’s did after it was first enacted in 2016. A Flagstaff lawyer who contracted to help defend jailed people sued on First Amendment grounds, arguing that the law violated his free speech rights.A  while the case proceeded, but the Legislature changed the law so it only applied to contracts worth more than $100,000, effectively ending the case because it no longer applied to the Flagstaff man. The state was ordered to pay $115,000 for his attorney fees.In Arkansas, the publisher of a weekly newspaper sued to block that state’s law on similar grounds. A trial judge dismissed the case, ruling that “a boycott of Israel is neither speech nor inherently expressive conduct” protected by the First Amendment. But a split three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  in February, finding that “supporting or promoting boycotts of Israel is constitutionally protected … yet the Act requires government contractors to abstain from such constitutionally protected activity.”The ruling is not the last word: In June, 8th Circuit judges agreed to hear the case and vacated the three-judge panel’s decision. They are set to hear arguments in the case later this month.Both cases were brought by the American Civil Liberties Union.Meanwhile in Arizona, Yee wrote to Unilever’s investor relations department on Sept. 2 to tell the company that although Ben & Jerry’s is run independently, Arizona law would require her to sell Unilever assets if the decision was not rescinded.“I gave Unilever PLC, the parent company of Ben & Jerry’s, an ultimatum: reverse the action of Ben & Jerry’s or divest itself of Ben & Jerry’s to come into compliance with Arizona law or face the consequences,” Yee, a Republican who is running for governor, said in a statement. “They chose the latter.”Unilever said in an Aug. 2 letter to Deputy Treasurer Mark Swenson that it has never supported boycotts of Israel, commonly called Boycott Divestment Sanctions, or BDS, but that Ben & Jerry’s operates independently. The company had no additional comment.The Arizona investments were in bonds and commercial paper held in the state’s short-term fixed-income investment fund.The Arizona law enacted in 201 6 and revised in 2019 had broad, bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. He tweeted that the Ben & Jerry’s decision “is discrimination.”“Arizona will not do business with a company that boycotts Israel — in 2016 and 2019, I signed bills to make sure of it,” the tweet said. “Arizona stands with Israel.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/arizona-divests-ben-jerrys-unilever.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=744

At least six people got vaccinated after speaking with Kathy, Linder said, according to MLive.com.Kathy has since been released on hospice care to spend time with her family as her symptoms continue to worsen. Ahead of her release, Kathy and Linder hugged goodbye. ""It was too late for her,"" said Linder, who got permission from Kathy to share her story.

Traveler beware.A map  in countries across the globe from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows the US is one of the most perilous places to visit amid the pandemic. The map shows the  in each country and ranks locales with available data in four categories — low, moderate, high and very high risk. The CDC arrives at each determination primarily by calculating the incident rate of infection and new case trajectory over the last 28 days.The US has a Level 4 “very high” designation  but so does a far reaching swath of other locales spanning a variety of income levels, vaccine availability and public health systems.For example, Somalia also has a Level 4 designation but only .07 percent of their total population is fully vaccinated, according to global vaccine tracker Our World in Data, compared to the US, which has about 53.6 percent of all people fully inoculated, CDC numbers show.Mexico, on the other hand, is a Level 3 designation but has about half the inoculation levels the US has. “If you look at the countries that are level four, there’s a wide variety of kinds of countries, you have countries in Western Europe, you have South America, you have some in Africa, it’s not just high-income countries, it’s not just low and middle-income countries, it’s really a complicated equation to sort this out,” said Dr. Isaac Weisfuse, a medical epidemiologist from Cornell University Public Health and the former deputy commissioner of New York City’s Health Department.“[This map is] telling us that there’s many factors that go into the spread of the virus including behavior, variants, population density, [climate, testing] and there are probably issues we just don’t know about.”He noted some countries that have low risk designations could be testing less and the CDC can only calculate the risk designations based on available data.Given the US’s abundance of available doses and the ease Americans across the country now have to access them, Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr from Columbia University said vaccine hesitancy is what’s keeping the US at a Level 4 designation — but it’s playing a part elsewhere, too.“People believe that vaccine hesitancy is only seen in high resource countries but it’s alive and well elsewhere,” the epidemiologist explained, pointing to countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iran, which also have Level 4 designations.Still, vaccine access continues to be an issue in the developing world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, and a lot of work needs to be done to bridge the gap, El-Sadr said.“These vaccines can be game changers, they can be our pathway to leaving this epidemic behind us, both in this country and around the world but that means we have to make sufficient vaccines for us and the rest of the world,” she said. “And we have to work very hard to get people to seek vaccination and get vaccinated as soon as possible.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Floridaairport.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=744,"4-year-old Galveston County girl with COVID who died remembered as 'funny and sassy,' mom says - KHOU.com

CDC Investigates 4 Early Cases - Yahoo News
Late last year, the federal government’s chief statistician on death received word about a tantalizing discovery: Someone had died from COVID-19 in January 2020, a death certificate said, a revelation that would have sped up the timeline of the virus’s spread in the United States by several weeks.That death was ultimately not what it seemed. The person who certified it had meant June 2020, not January. But that blip on the radar screen of Robert Anderson, the chief of mortality statistics at a branch of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helped to kick off a quiet, yearlong campaign at the agency to check and recheck the country’s first suspected COVID-related deaths in the uncertain days of early 2020.Now at least four possible COVID-19 deaths from January 2020 have survived Anderson’s vetting. Spread out across four states, they have become part of a scattershot collection of clues about the virus’s early spread beyond China — some of them trustworthy, others less so — that have begun drawing more attention as scientists and intelligence officials try to unravel how the pandemic began.The odds that all four of the CDC’s new death cases — from Kansas, California, Alabama and Wisconsin — really did result from COVID-19 are slim, some scientists said. This year, a doctor or another official certifier reclassified them as being COVID-related. But whether they did so solely on the basis of the person’s symptoms or with the help of more useful blood or tissue samples is not clear.The earliest death, on Jan. 9, 2020, in Kansas, was reclassified this spring on the basis of the person’s symptoms alone, the state health department said, putting the onus on a doctor to evaluate how closely the patient’s disease matched the symptoms of COVID-19. The most common symptoms of the virus, including a fever, difficulty breathing and even a loss of taste or smell, overlap with symptoms of other respiratory illnesses.In a sign of how difficult it can be to recategorize long-ago deaths, CDC records include a fifth COVID-related death from January 2020, in Oklahoma. But after state officials investigated, the medical examiner removed COVID-19 from the death certificate, Oklahoma’s health department said Wednesday, meaning that it will probably soon fall off the CDC’s records, too.It is not clear whether any of the suspected cases had traveled to China.“My guess is that they’re probably not all real, maybe not even any of them,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. It’s highly unlikely that any of the people caught the virus in the United States, he said, but it’s possible that some had recently been to China. “If any of them are real, they’d be travel-linked cases, and that’s conceivable,” he said.Worobey’s research, including close analyses of viral genomes and epidemic simulations, has indicated that the virus was unlikely to be spreading outside of China before mid-December 2019, making nontraveler deaths in the United States the following month doubtful, he said. Several weeks typically pass between someone getting infected and dying, and any given case is unlikely to be fatal.“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,” Worobey said.For Anderson, the trustworthiness of the January 2020 deaths is not only a public health concern but also a personal preoccupation.A demographer by training who landed at the CDC in 1996 after staring down a treacherous academic job market, Anderson said that certain deaths had an outsize impact, statistically speaking — and that includes COVID deaths early in the pandemic.When states submit COVID-19 death numbers, the CDC normally takes them at face value, as it does for hundreds of thousands of deaths from heart disease or cancer any given year. The agency recorded nearly 3 million registered deaths in 2019, and a mistake here or there does not change the country’s overall picture of mortality, Anderson said.Not so for a possible COVID death at the dawn of a pandemic. At the time, testing was scarce. Until The Mercury News in California recently reported on the possible cases from January 2020, the earliest suspected COVID-related fatality was not until Feb. 6, 2020.When Anderson is notified of COVID-related deaths from the first two months of 2020, he calls state health officials, who in turn ask for verification from the doctor or medical examiner who signed the death certificate.In January of this year, for instance, the CDC received a flurry of reports of people having died from COVID-19 in January 2020. Or so they said. Further checking revealed that most doctors had simply forgotten to start writing 2021 next to their signatures.In another case this summer, Anderson confirmed that a medical certifier had meant to reclassify a January 2020 death as COVID-related, only for that certifier to backtrack once the state health department intervened.Looming over the drudgery, for Anderson, is a single death from 2007 that the agency had said was caused by diphtheria, a serious bacterial infection that is virtually unheard-of in the United States. The CDC later determined that the death had not been caused by diphtheria at all; a simple coding error was to blame.“That was a little embarrassing to have in our data file,” Anderson said. “Even though it’s just one death, in that context, it has a big impact, because it’s high-profile.”Ultimately, though, without access to patient samples or medical records, the CDC has to trust the people who sign COVID-19 death certificates, he said.“I can’t say for sure these are all accurate,” Anderson said of the January 2020 deaths. “But I think it unlikely that certifiers would have capriciously changed the death certificate.”Most COVID-19 deaths are straightforward to certify, said Marcus Nashelsky, a professor of pathology at the University of Iowa who helped the CDC write guidelines about how to attribute such deaths. For example, early in the pandemic, when nursing home patients were not always being tested, he said, a known outbreak in the home, in combination with characteristic symptoms and signs of the virus, could be enough for a doctor to declare a COVID-related death.Nevertheless, death certificates have become hotly contested documents during the pandemic. In some cases, disbelieving families have asked that someone’s death certificate be wiped of any mention of COVID-19, said James Gill, Connecticut’s chief medical examiner and the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. In others, families have urged that COVID-19 be added to a death certificate, seemingly in an effort to become eligible for funeral funding under a federal assistance program, he said.“It’s a very emotional thing for some families, whether or not they want it on the death certificate,” Gill said. “It shouldn’t be. It’s a public health matter.”In spring 2020, Gill said, he became concerned that Connecticut was overlooking COVID-19 deaths, especially among nursing home residents whose complicated medical histories can sometimes obscure causes of death. In a few hundred cases, he said, the medical examiner’s office conducted deep nasal swabs on bodies at funeral homes. The team found a number of cases.With China refusing to share more information about its own early cases, the World Health Organization recently said that it was helping researchers dig into reports of cases in late 2019 outside of China. In Italy, researchers have reported coronavirus antibodies in blood samples from September 2019, as well as signs of the virus in a patient’s skin sample from November of that year. Some scientists, though, have questioned both findings.“The further back you can go, the more informative it may be — if you do have true, confirmed cases,” said Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virus expert whose lab retested the Italian blood samples and could not confirm the earliest cases. “For declaring a much earlier introduction of the pandemic virus into a region, you have to have a high level of certainty.”An analysis of U.S. blood tests published this summer suggested that the virus may have been circulating in Illinois as early as Dec. 24, 2019, though scientists have said that those methods, too, are fallible.Keri Althoff, a public health researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and lead author of that study, said that small clusters of cases could have developed without igniting a full-blown epidemic. “Where COVID was seeded in the U.S. is not fully known,” she said, “but it wasn’t likely to have been a single seed.” 2021 The New York Times Company",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vb6v5NXkVwrMrMJX71yltA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQ3MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.ZneGOt.MjztQvC0BXKd4A--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_new_york_times_articles_158/5bf790bb2996d9c808e13874f5465f34
"Disney says the rest of its 2021 slate of movies will have exclusive theatrical releases - The Verge
The remaining movies on Disney’s 2021 slate will all be released in theaters exclusively before being released on its Disney Plus streaming platform, the company announced late Friday.“Following the tremendous box office success of our summer films which included five of the top eight domestic releases of the year, we are excited to update our theatrical plans for the remainder of 2021,”  Kareem Daniel, chairman, Disney media & entertainment distribution said in a news release, adding that “confidence in moviegoing continues to improve.”The coronavirus pandemic and temporary closures of movie theaters that began last spring led movie studios to delay the release of many of their films, hoping to allow time for pandemic restrictions to ease and let people return to theaters in large numbers. Warner Bros’ raised the ire of many in Hollywood when it  that its entire 2021 slate would be released simultaneously on its HBO Max streaming platform. Disney’s decision follows the  of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and Free Guy. Disney released each of those movies with an exclusive 45-day theatrical window. Shang-Chi topped  release, the second-biggest opening haul for films released theatrically during the pandemic, and Free Guy brought in $28.4 million in its August debut. Both films have since surpassed $100 million at the box office.But Disney is dealing with the fallout of its decision to release Black Widow, starring Scarlett Johansson, in theaters and on its Disney Plus streaming platform (for a $30 fee) at the same time in July. Johansson sued Disney, alleging that the simultaneous release reduced the amount of money the film garnered in theaters. The actress’ salary was partly based on Black Widow’s box-office performance, which meant she stood to lose a significant amount of money. Disney has disputed the merits of Johansson’s suit. Black Widow brought in $80 million at the domestic box office in its July 9th opening weekend, and generated $80 million via Disney Plus, Variety reported.The release schedule for the remainder of Disney movies in 2021 has the animated musical movie Encanto debuting in theaters November 24th for a 30-day window.

"Prehistoric winged lizard unearthed in Chile - Phys.org
Chilean scientists have announced the discovery of the first-ever southern hemisphere remains of a type of Jurassic-era ""winged lizard"" known as a pterosaur.

Mike Curley tells 'Your World' how he exited the 17th floor of the South Tower""The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, were a national tragedy that resulted in a staggering loss of life and a significant change in American culture. Each year, we pause and never forget. Beyond remembering and honoring the Americans who died that day, NASA also assisted FEMA in New York in the days afterward, and remembered the victims by providing flags flown aboard the Space Shuttle to their families,"" NASA wrote in a release. NASA also shared the words of astronaut Frank Culbertson, who was aboard the International Space Station (ISS) at the time of the attacks and the only American on the crew. 
      Visible from space, a smoke plume rises from the Manhattan area after two planes crashed into the towers of the World Trade Center. This photo was taken of metropolitan New York City (and other parts of New York as well as New Jersey) the morning of September 11, 2001. ""Our prayers and thoughts go out to all the people there, and everywhere else,"" said Station Commander Frank Culbertson of Expedition 3, after the terrorists' attacks.
      He began documenting the event in photographs as the station flew over the New York City area. ""The smoke seemed to have an odd bloom to it at the base of the column that was streaming south of the city,"" Culbertson wrote in a post at the time of the attack. After reading one of the news articles we just received, I believe we were looking at [New York] around the time of, or shortly after, the collapse of the second tower. How horrible…""""It's horrible to see smoke pouring from wounds in your own country from such a fantastic vantage point,"" he said. ""The dichotomy of being on a spacecraft dedicated to improving life on the earth and watching life being destroyed by such willful, terrible acts is jolting to the psyche, no matter who you are.""NASA noted that, after the attack, its science programs were ""called into action"" as the agency worked with FEMA to fly sensors over the affected areas on aircraft – looking for aerial contaminants – and used satellite resources to monitor from above.To remember the day, NASA flew nearly 6,000 4-by-6 inch flags on Endeavour's December 2001 flight to honor the victims. The flags were later distributed to relatives in the summer of 2002. In addition, NASA used aluminum recovered from the destroyed World Trade Center towers – with the image of an American flag – on rock abrasion tools for the .

NASA's next crewed space station will be near the moon. The planned lunar Gateway space station will house crews for between one and three months so they can perform a series of ambitious jobs: to conduct science experiments further away from Earth for long periods of time; to support missions on the surface; and perhaps to even do far-out engineering work such as telerobotics.This gallery details some of the main history and components of Gateway, as well as what it may be used for in the future. For now, NASA plans to bring astronauts to Gateway sometime in the 2020s, possibly in support of the Artemis moon-landing program. Artemis was targeting a 2024 moon landing, although an August 2021 report from the Office of the Inspector General said this target is ""not feasible"" due to spacesuit development delays. More timeline changes may therefore be in store.Related: NASA has wanted a lunar space station for decades, and  the Gateway concept dates back at least to the early 2010s. In 2012, NASA publicly discussed the idea of a lunar station on the moon's far side — then called the Deep Space Habitat. Around 2014 and 2015, NASA began to publicly discuss ""cislunar habitats"" to fly humans on longer missions in the 2020s.Gateway's name has also changed a few times. NASA documentation in 2017 refers to a Deep Space Gateway space station around the moon. In 2018, the space station was renamed the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) in NASA's proposed 2019 budget. These days, the agency prefers using the simpler term ""Gateway.""In 2019, NASA tapped Northrop Grumman to build the habitation and logistics outpost (HALO). The design of the habitation module is based on the Cygnus cargo spacecraft, which regularly ferries equipment and supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). NASA also made its selection of Northrop Grumman because the company made progress on modifying Cygnus for a habitation module, and Cygnus is small enough to be launched on existing commercial launch vehicles (simplifying the development of Gateway).The habitat, Northrop Grumman said, ""can sustain up to four astronauts for up to 30 days as they embark on, and return from, expeditions to the lunar surface."" Northrop Grumman  to design the habitat module in June 2020 to prepare for its preliminary design review, which was completed that November. The company then  from NASA in July 2021 to complete the design and development of HALO. The module is scheduled to launch to the moon's vicinity in 2024 aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.The power and propulsion module of Gateway will be based on a salvaged design from propulsion studies related to NASA's Asteroid Redirect Mission, which was canceled in 2017. In May 2019, NASA selected Maxar to build the power and propulsion element of the Gateway. The element will be a solar electric propulsion unit that can be maneuvered around the moon and adapted for a Mars journey as well, according to NASA. Maxar is best known in space tech for a large fleet of Earth-imaging satellites.Maxar completed a  for the module in 2019, and  in early 2021. Along with HALO, the power and propulsion module is expected to launch toward the moon aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket in 2024.The Canadian Space Agency announced in May 2019 that it would  to Gateway called Canadarm3, building on previous generations of robotic arms supplied to the space shuttle and ISS programs. Canadarm3 is designed to be built with a measure of machine learning so that the arm can do maintenance and surveillance on Gateway in between astronaut missions, as the lunar space station won't be continuously occupied. In exchange, NASA pledged in 2020 to fly a Canadian astronaut on Artemis' first moon-orbiting mission — continuing a long-standing tradition of rewarding Canadian space robotics contributions with astronaut seats and orbital science time.Canada pledged to spend $2.05 billion Canadian dollars ($1.56 billion USD at the time) on Canadarm3 and a  (LEAP) over 24 years. LEAP is a Canadian program meant to encourage businesses to research lunar missions with applications in robotics, health and artificial intelligence. The Canadian company MDA (which also managed Canadarm and Canadarm2) received a series of Canadarm3-related contracts, most recently  for the preliminary and detailed design of external robotics interfaces that will enable Canadarm3 to operate.In August 2019, NASA issued a request for proposals from American companies to create spacecraft that could carry and deliver pressurized and unpressurized cargo to Gateway. Similarly to ISS cargo ships, the craft would launch on a commercial rocket and remain docked at Gateway for up to six months before being removed for autonomous disposal.The first Gateway missions will likely be performed by Lockheed Martin's Orion spacecraft, although other crewed vessels may venture to the space station in later years. The Orion spacecraft's development history long predates Artemis: It has outlived several since-canceled NASA initiatives, including the administration's Constellation program to bring humans to the moon and Mars, and a flexible-destination approach NASA adopted for almost a decade after the 2010 cancelation of Constellation.Orion has successfully performed one test flight to date — a high Earth-orbiting mission called Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1) — on Dec. 5, 2014. Orion's next flight, Artemis 1, is expected in late 2021,but it has been delayed several times since 2017 due to issues with the Space Launch System rocket. The spacecraft will include a crew module and service module, with vital spacecraft systems for power, fuel and oxygen generation — similar to the Apollo command module that orbited the moon in the 1960s and 1970s.Gateway will operate in a new orbit that’s not yet used by lunar spacecraft, either crewed or uncrewed. The pathway is called a  (NRHO), which enables the spacecraft to swoop low over the south pole while flying high at other points in its orbit. NRHO will range between 1,860 miles and 43,500 miles (3,000 and 70,000 kilometers) from the surface of the moon, according to the European Space Agency, and will rotate together with the moon. The orbit will take roughly seven days to complete and will pass through a minimum of eclipses, allowing the sun to keep Gateway powered for much of the time. The multi-partner CAPSTONE Cubesat mission will test out the orbit after launching no earlier than October 2021.Unlike the ISS, which has been continuously occupied since 2000, Gateway will not see crews constantly trading duties in a series of unbroken rotations. Instead, the crews will only remain on the space station for , and will leave Gateway uncrewed in between.This situation is largely because flying NASA astronauts to lunar orbit is very expensive compared to low Earth orbit, requiring combinations of Space Launch System rockets and Orion spacecraft. This will likely leave Gateway uninhabited for most of its lifetime, unless other providers choose to send crews out to the outpost in between to fill in the gap, as  will allow international companies and crews to dock with and use the space station.One of Gateway's main functions could be acting as a waystation for spacecraft and crew on their way to and from lunar landings. NASA's vision is to have an Artemis Base Camp in Shackleton Crater, a region of the moon that appears rich in water ice, based on uncrewed spacecraft data. The facility will eventually require supplies for water, waste disposal, landing vehicles, communications and radiation shielding, NASA said. The facility is also anticipated to include astronaut mobility systems and , along with a host of experiments.Lunar telerobotics may also be possible from Gateway. Astronauts could operate a series of rovers or movable craft that examine craters or construct radio antennae for telescopic observations. That said, it remains to be seen whether such activities are a good use of astronauts' valuable — or if it’s better to do these activities from Earth, where there would be a two-second time delay between issuing a command and it being received on the moon's near-side surface. Gateway's design is still evolving, and it is hard to make predictions about how it will support lunar exploration, let alone Mars exploration. In 2020, for example, media reports indicated that Gateway would be  to Artemis exploration. However, NASA maintains that many of the ""lessons learned"" from Artemis and Gateway will be useful for eventual Mars exploration, ranging from how to supply astronauts from far away, to keeping crew members safe, to learning to ""live off the land"" on another world via .While Mars connections remain speculative and subject to change, past proposals for Gateway with regard to the Red Planet include using it as a waystation for samples, building up  with an eye to preparing for Mars, and using Gateway as a ""Mars analog"" to prepare for Red Planet missions.Follow Elizabeth Howell on Twitter @howellspace.

Not all caterpillars grow up to be beautiful butterflies. Some become living milkshakes for their dads, who guzzle caterpillar body fluids to attract the ladies.Recently, scientists reported the first evidence of butterflies sipping from the bodies of caterpillars — dead and alive. They observed adult milkweed butterflies in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, using tiny claws on their feet to scratch wounds in caterpillars' bodies so they could lap the liquid that oozed out. Male butterflies seek certain compounds produced by milkweed (flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae), which repel predators and help the butterflies produce pheromones that attract females. Since caterpillars are stuffed with juices from chewed-up plants, they make an easy target for butterflies looking to chemically boost their attractiveness to females. Related: ""The caterpillar larvae would contort their bodies rapidly in what appeared to be futile attempts to deter the persistent scratching of adults,"" said the researchers who observed the butterfly baby-drinking. They described their observations in a study published Sept. 8 in the journal Ecology.Butterflies in the Danainae family are known as milkweed butterflies because most of the caterpillars in this group feed on milkweed plants, which contain toxic alkaloids that are absorbed by the caterpillars and then processed into useful chemicals that protect them from predators. Another use for these alkaloids is in mating pheromones, which are transferred to females in the males' sperm packet ""as a nuptial gift,"" the scientists wrote.Most milkweed butterfly species are found in Asia, but four species live in North America, one of which is the colorful monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), . Male butterflies in this family are known for a unique behavior called leaf-scratching, in which adults supplement the plant sap they absorbed as hungry caterpillars by scraping at milkweed leaves with their tiny claws to release alkaloid-loaded sap for drinking through their long proboscis. Sometimes males gather by the hundreds to scratch and sip on milkweed leaves, according to the study.But on Dec. 9, 2019, lead study author Yi-Kai Tea, a doctoral candidate in the University of Sydney's School of Life and Environmental Sciences, and co-author Jonathan Soong Wei, a naturalist in Singapore, saw milkweed butterflies in Indonesia's Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve that were scratching at a different sap-loaded source: live milkweed caterpillars.""Multiple adults were observed scratching many caterpillars along a stretch of coastal vegetation"" that spanned more than 1,600 feet (500 meters), the researchers reported. They then saw the butterflies actively drink ""from the wounded and oozing caterpillars"" for hours, with the butterflies sometimes gathering in mixed-species groups. So intent were the butterflies on drinking from the caterpillars that not even the touch of a human observer could distract them, the study authors wrote. To describe the behavior, the scientists coined the term ""kleptopharmacophagy,"" which means ""consuming stolen chemicals.""""The alternative neologisms 'kairopharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from wounded caterpillars detected via 'eavesdropping') or 'necropharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from dead caterpillars) might also be appropriate,"" the researchers reported.— ——Over three days, the scientists counted seven species of milkweed butterflies that scraped and sipped living and dead caterpillars (it is unknown if the dead caterpillars were drunk to death or died of their wounds). One possible explanation for why the butterflies find caterpillars so delicious is because milkweed alkaloids accumulate in the caterpillars' bodies from the leaves that they eat, making their internal ""juices"" a more potent, alkaloid-rich brew — and thereby more attractive to thirsty males, the scientist suggested. It's likely that the butterflies are drawn to milkweed leaves that are already damaged from caterpillar chewing; those caterpillars would be close by when the adults start scratching. If a butterfly accidentally scrapes a caterpillar, the wound would release a heady chemical scent that would attract the butterfly and encourage it to scratch the caterpillar even more, according to the study. Many questions remain about this unusual (and ghastly) behavior, such as which specific plant compounds attract the butterflies to the caterpillars and do butterflies in other parts of the world also practice baby-drinking, Tea said in a statement. ""These simple observations raise questions about the ecology of these well-known butterflies, providing numerous opportunities for future studies,"" he said.Originally published on Live Science.Mindy Weisberger is a Live Science senior writer covering a general beat that includes climate change, paleontology, weird animal behavior, and space.

"Epic Games head Tim Sweeney responds to ruling in Apple lawsuit - Gamesradar
A major ruling has been made in the Epic vs Apple lawsuit that could have huge consequences for the App Store moving forward. An injunction issued as part of the long-running Epic vs Apple lawsuit would prevent Apple from requiring developers to use its own payment methods in App Store games and apps – a landmark ruling that could make the once-walled garden that is the App Store much more competitive. To parse that legalese, the court has essentially ruled that app and game developers can now use third-party payment methods for apps and games hosted on the App Store, thus allowing them to work around Apple's 30% transaction fee. The lawsuit had come about because Epic updated Fortnite mobile with a direct purchase option that circumvented Apple's restrictions, which saw the game removed from the iOS store. For all the case's tangents, Apple's allegedly monopolistic monetization policies have always been at the center of Epic's lawsuit. In a series of tweets, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney affirmed that ""Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers."" He also stressed that ""Today’s ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers. Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers."" Today’s ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers. Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers. https://t.co/cGTBxThnsPSeptember 10, 2021This injunction will reinforce and add to changes which Apple recently announced . The company said it would allow developers to share information about third-party payment methods with players via external communication, but it must now allow developers to integrate those methods directly. It's worth noting that the full ruling is less clear-cut than this injunction may imply. While the court ruled ""that Apple's conduct in enforcing anti-steering restrictions is anticompetitive,"" it did not find ""that Apple is an antitrust monopolist in the submarket for mobile gaming transactions."" And though Epic is undeniably the winner today, and it's far from the only developer that will benefit from these App Store changes, it will still be forced to pay Apple 30% of the $12,167,719 in revenue that it received during the brief window that Fortnite allowed direct payments on iOS, on top of additional damages.  Of course, this won't be the end of the Epic vs Apple lawsuit. As the injunction notes, either party can seek to modify this ruling, and Apple is expected to appeal its case and bring it to a higher court. Thanks to everyone who put so much time and effort into the battle over fair competition on digital platforms, and thanks especially to the court for managing a very complex case on a speedy timeline.

A new post on Apple’s Support forum says exposing iPhones to high-amplitude vibrations, “specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines” could degrade the devices’ camera system. The company recommends against mounting an iPhone on a motorcycle, as the vibrations may be transmitted via the bike’s handlebars and chassis. Here’s the technical explanation from Apple:If you accidentally move a camera when you take a picture, the resulting image can be blurry. To prevent this, some iPhone models have optical image stabilization (OIS).1 OIS lets you take sharp photos even if you accidentally move the camera. With OIS, a gyroscope senses that the camera moved. To reduce image motion, and the resulting blur, the lens moves according to the angle of the gyroscope.Additionally, some iPhone models have closed-loop autofocus (AF).2 Closed-loop AF resists the effects of gravity and vibration to preserve sharp focus in stills, videos, and panoramas. With closed-loop AF, on-board magnetic sensors measure gravity and vibration effects and determine the lens position so that the compensating motion can be set accurately.The OIS and closed-loop AF systems in iPhone are designed for durability. However, as is the case with many consumer electronics that include systems like OIS, long-term direct exposure to high-amplitude vibrations within certain frequency ranges may degrade the performance of these systems and lead to reduced image quality for photos and videos. It is recommended to avoid exposing your iPhone to extended high-amplitude vibrations. The iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and all iPhones since the iPhone 7 have both optical image stabilization and closed-loop autofocus (as noted by MacRumors, the first outlet to spot the Apple support post). Both features are also vulnerable to , Apple warned earlier this year, but removing the accessories should take care of that issue. Additionally in the new post, Apple says if you’re planning to mount your iPhone to a scooter or a moped, it recommends using a vibration-dampening mount to lessen the risk to the phone and its camera system. And avoiding prolonged regular use of an iPhone mounted to a vehicle that produces lower-amplitude vibrations is also a good idea.

Misinformation researchers who've been relying on the data Facebook provides them may have lost months or even years of work. That's because the social network has been giving them flawed and incomplete information on how users interact with posts and links on the website, according to The New York Times. Facebook has been giving academics access to its data over the past couple of years to track the spread of misinformation on its platform. It promised researchers transparency and access to all user interaction, but the data the company has been giving them reportedly only includes interactions for about half of its users in the US. Further, most of the users whose interactions were included in the reports are the ones who engage with political posts enough to make their leanings clear.In an email to researchers The Times saw, Facebook apologized for the ""inconvenience [it] may have caused."" The company also told them that it's fixing the issue, but that it could take weeks due to the sheer volume of data it has to process. Facebook told the researchers, though, that the data they received for users outside the US isn't inaccurate.Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones blamed the data inaccuracy to a ""technical error,"" which the company is apparently ""working swiftly to resolve."" As The Times notes, it was University of Urbino associate professor Fabio Giglietto who first discovered the inaccuracy. Giglietto compared the data handed over to researchers with the ""Widely Viewed Content Report"" the social network published publicly in August and found that the results didn't match. Other researchers raised concerns after that report was published. Alice Marwick, a researcher from the University of North Carolina, told Engadget that they couldn't verify those results, because they had no access to the data Facebook used. The company reportedly held a call with researchers on Friday to apologize. Megan Squire, one of those researchers, told The Times: ""From a human point of view, there were 47 people on that call today and every single one of those projects is at risk, and some are completely destroyed.""Some researchers have been using their own tools to gather information for their research, but in at least one instance, Facebook cut off their access. In August, Facebook disabled the accounts associated with the NYU Ad Observatory project. The team used a browser extension to collect information on political ads, but the social network said it was ""unauthorized scraping."" At the time, Laura Edelson, the project's lead researcher, told Engadget that Facebook is silencing the team because its ""work often calls attention to problems on its platform.""

"US pulls missile defenses in Saudi Arabia amid Yemen attacks - Yahoo News
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. has removed its most advanced missile defense system and Patriot batteries from Saudi Arabia in recent weeks, even as the kingdom faced continued air attacks from Yemen's Houthi rebels, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press show. The redeployment of the defenses from Prince Sultan Air Base outside of Riyadh came as America's Gulf Arab allies nervously watched , including their last-minute evacuations from Kabul's besieged international airport. While tens of thousands of American forces remain across the Arabian Peninsula as a counterweight to Iran, Gulf Arab nations worry about the U.S.'s future plans as its military perceives a growing threat in Asia that requires those missile defenses. Tensions remain high as negotiations appear stalled in Vienna over Iran's collapsed nuclear deal with world powers, raising the danger of future confrontations in the region.“Perceptions matter whether or not they’re rooted in a cold, cold reality. And the perception is very clear that the U.S. is not as committed to the Gulf as it used to be in the views of many people in decision-making authority in the region,” said Kristian Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. “From the Saudi point of view, they now see Obama, Trump and Biden — three successive presidents — taking decisions that signify to some extent an abandonment.”Prince Sultan Air Base, some 115 kilometers (70 miles) southeast of Riyadh,  since a 2019 missile-and-drone attack on the heart of the kingdom's oil production. That attack, though claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, , according to experts and physical debris left behind. Tehran has denied launching the attack, . Just southwest of the air base's runway, a 1-square-kilometer (third-of-a-square-mile) area set off by an earthen berm saw American forces station Patriot missile batteries, as well as one advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit, according to satellite images from Planet Labs Inc. A THAAD can destroy ballistic missiles at a higher altitude than Patriots. A satellite image seen by the AP in late August showed some of the batteries removed from the area, though activity and vehicles still could be seen there. A high-resolution Planet Lab satellite picture taken Friday showed the batteries' pads at the site empty, with no visible activity. A redeployment of the missiles had been rumored for months, in part due to a desire to face what  However, the withdrawal came just as  at the kingdom's airport in Abha. The kingdom has been locked in a stalemate war with the Houthis since March 2015.Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby acknowledged “the redeployment of certain air defense assets” after receiving questions from the AP. He said the U.S. maintained a “broad and deep” commitment to its Mideast allies.""The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby said. In a statement to the AP, the Saudi Defense Ministry described the kingdom's relationship with the U.S. as “strong, longstanding and historic” even while acknowledging the withdrawal of the American missile defense systems. It said the Saudi military “is capable of defending its lands, seas and airspace, and protecting its people.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the statement said. Despite those assurances, Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal, the kingdom's former intelligence chief whose public remarks often track with the thoughts of its Al Saud ruling family, has linked the Patriot missile deployments directly to America's relationship to Riyadh. “I think we need to be reassured about American commitment,” . ""That looks like, for example, not withdrawing Patriot missiles from Saudi Arabia at a time when Saudi Arabia is the victim of missile attacks and drone attacks — not just from Yemen, but from Iran.”U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, on a tour of the Mideast in recent days, had been slated to go to Saudi Arabia but the trip was canceled due to what American officials referred to as scheduling problems. Saudi Arabia declined to discuss why Austin's trip didn't happen after the withdrawal of the missile defenses. Saudi Arabia maintains its own Patriot missile batteries and typically fires two missiles at an incoming target. That's become an expensive proposition amid the Houthi campaign, as each Patriot missile costs more than $3 million. The kingdom also claims to intercept nearly every missile and drone launched at the kingdom, . While Greece agreed in April to lend a Patriot missile battery to Saudi Arabia, the timing of the U.S. withdrawals comes amid wider uncertainty over the American posture in the region. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries have renewed diplomacy with Iran as a hedge.“I think we saw in Biden’s statements on Afghanistan, the way he said things that he’s clearly going to put U.S. interests first and obviously that came as quite a disappointment to partners and allies around the world who maybe hoped for something different after Trump,” said Ulrichsen, the research fellow. ""He sounds quite similar to an ‘America First’ approach, just sort of a different tone.”___Associated Press writers Lolita C.

A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation.It was August 27, 2018, and Shihabi — the founder of the Arabia Foundation, a new Washington DC-based Saudi-advocacy nonprofit — had flown thirty VIPs 4,000 miles by business class for the foundation's second annual summit, an invite-only affair conducted under strict Chatham House rules (pass on what you learn, but don't name names).His reputation, newly built in Washington, was on the line.At dinner, dignitaries like Prince Khalid bin Bandar al-Saud, the Saudi ambassador to the UK, rubbed shoulders with journalists and leading political analysts. Shihabi — tall, stubbly, and bespectacled — steered the discussions.Shihabi, a former banker, had opened the foundation in March 2017 to fill what he believed was a gaping hole. To him, Saudi Arabia was woefully misunderstood, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reforms were real, not just bread and circuses. Shihabi believed his government was failing to sell itself. Shihabi quickly made his mark on Washington, hosting dinners with the city's elite and making cable-news rounds. But when the foundation shuttered abruptly, 11 months after the La Réserve summit, the city was nonplussed. What happened? The closure was intriguing, not least because Shihabi had made as many adversaries as friends advancing the Saudi cause, especially in his defense of Crown Prince Mohammed, also known as MBS, in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder.This is the story of how the Arabia Foundation rose and vanished, according to hundreds of pages of leaked court filings from an ongoing employee lawsuit, and interviews with ten people connected to Shihabi or his foundation.Shihabi was tight-lipped about the closure at the time, attributing it to differences among donors. ""Nothing more exciting than that I'm afraid,"" he tweeted. Others were unconvinced.In its debut dispatch, the Arabia Foundation promised to fill what it called ""a critical gap in the understanding and coverage of Saudi Arabia."" Among friends, Shihabi often grumbled that it was absurd that US academics who had never stepped foot on Saudi soil, or learned Arabic, appeared in US media to demystify the kingdom's affairs. Shihabi hired Firas Maksad, a top Middle East-focused think-tank operative, as CEO. ""Firas was basically Ali's facilitator,"" Geneive Abdo, a foundation employee, said in a September 2020 court deposition. ""He introduced him to people around town."" Shihabi also enlisted Bernard Haykel, a leading US scholar of Saudi Arabia and his friend of 20 years, as one of several unpaid advisors.Shihabi inculcated Washingtonians about Saudi Arabia, attending book parties and hosting off-the-record dinners in Georgetown, Politico reported. He racked up scores of newspaper and cable-news appearances discussing Saudi affairs.Money flowed in. The foundation received $6 million in 2017 and 2018, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. Shihabi told employees and acquaintances that his donors were wealthy businessmen in Riyadh, but questions over the source of these funds dogged him.Shihabi never pretended to be nonpartisan, however, and in private deliberations was upfront about his links to the Saudi elite. He often flew between Riyadh and Washington, had met MBS several times, and had cordial relations with figures like Prince Faisal bin Farhan, the Saudi foreign minister. Before Washington, Shihabi worked at banks on the Arabian peninsula, including the Saudi Central Bank.""People weren't lapping up milk like uncritical kittens,"" J. Adam Ereli, a director at the Arabia Foundation, told Insider. ""They knew that Ali was Saudi, they knew that he had official Saudi support.""Shihabi's father, Samir, was a Palestinian refugee naturalized by Saudi Arabia in the 1940s, who later served as Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, Pakistan, and Turkey.Ali, who spent much of his youth living outside Saudi Arabia due to his father's postings, felt a strong sense of belonging regardless. ""It's a region that has been good to him and his family,"" Haykel said.A year into Shihabi's mission, Saudi Arabia's stock was high in Washington. The CEOs of Apple and Google treated MBS to  in April 2018 and, in June, then-President Donald Trump heaped praise on MBS for letting Saudi women drive for the first time. But that sentiment evaporated when, in early October, Khashoggi was murdered in Saudi Arabia's consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi embassy on Washington's New Hampshire Avenue was mute, and Shihabi was the lone voice of opposition, appearing on PBS' ""Frontline"" and CNN's ""Amanpour"" to defend the kingdom's version of events. (The CIA would later conclude that MBS likely ordered the hit.)""Shihabi had to become the spokesperson for MBS in Washington,"" a former senior State Department official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told Insider. It was not a coincidence that Prince Khalid bin Salman al-Saud was replaced as ambassador soon after, the official added.Shihabi's stance riled many, especially as he had known Khashoggi well. ""Keep cashing those checks, Ali. I cannot for the life of me understand how you sleep at night,"" Karen Attiah, Khashoggi's editor, tweeted at the time.Shihabi briefly decamped to California after Khashoggi's death, and the furor eventually died down. From early 2019, Saudi lobbyists  on Capitol Hill and US companies .The Saudi cause arguably needed the Arabia Foundation more than ever. But on July 30, 2019, it vanished over lunch.At 10 a.m. that day, Shihabi seated himself beneath his foundation's banners for a panel discussion hosted alongside the Atlantic Council. He was typically combative throughout the event, and when it ended at 12 p.m. he stood, swiftly shook hands, and exited the stage.Soon after, a message pinged on the Arabia Foundation's staff WhatsApp group. Everyone was to be back at the L Street office within the hour, Shihabi wrote. The foundation was closing.In a conference room, Shihabi told the roughly dozen people gathered around the table that his donors had stopped funding the operation. Staffers should pack their things and their email addresses would stop working, he said. Days later they would receive nondisclosure agreements to sign, which would release their severance pay.The closure came after a monthslong effort by Saudi officials to influence or hinder Shihabi's work, according to a person close to the foundation. The source requested anonymity out of fear for their safety but their identity is known to Insider.According to the source, in early 2019, Saudi officials had approached Shihabi and informed him that he was to start reporting to a government committee overseeing US-Saudi affairs. Spearheading the committee were Princess Reema bint Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the US, and Prince Khalid bin Salman, the kingdom's deputy defense minister, the source said, adding, ""That's just like saying, 'we're gonna pull the strings.'""The source also told Insider, without specifying details, that there were two Saudi officials in particular who were working to hamper Shihabi's efforts in Washington: Adel al-Juber, the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, and a senior civil servant who served as the head of the royal Diwan, the king's advisory chamber.""The Arabia Foundation was a victim of its own success,"" Ereli said of the closure.""As Ali became an increasingly powerful voice for the kingdom in the US, there were people in Riyadh who wanted to either control it or manage it.""""Ali was just hamstrung ... When he was off doing his thing and actually making a difference, it was fine. When people back in Riyadh started fucking with him, he just said, 'I'm done.'""""If the back office isn't helping you, then you can't do your job. When I say office in this case, I mean the government bureaucracy in Riyadh.""In a statement to Insider, Shihabi said: ""I set up the Foundation to be independent of donor interference. When I saw that that was no longer going to be possible, I closed it down. Simple as that.""The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, DC, did not respond to Insider's request for comment.In the days after the foundation's closure, speculation was rife in Washington.""It couldn't have been more abrupt,"" a senior academic, who has worked at Middle East-focused think tanks for more than two decades, told Insider. ""Something really weird happened because this is not what organizations do.""One theory, as Gregory Gause, an Arabia Foundation advisor, told Insider, was that the Khashoggi murder had made it ""extremely difficult to sell Saudi Arabia in the US.""Another theory was that donors bolted in light of a lawsuit filed against Shihabi by Ola Salem, the foundation's former communications director.In her April 2019 complaint, Salem claimed that Shihabi was discriminatory, made unwanted sexual advances, and threatened her. ""If you don't do a good job for this event I'll behead you,"" Shihabi told Salem in 2017, according to the complaint.Salem alleges that on another occasion Shihabi told her: ""Come over here — I didn't get my morning kiss today.""In his deposition, Shihabi said he ""continuously"" joked about beheading people for making trivial errors, and denied making the comment about the kiss. ""Had I felt the lawsuit had any merit, I would have settled quickly and quietly for a fraction of the legal costs, as many others do,"" Shihabi told Insider. The lawsuit is still ongoing.Those Insider spoke to for this story all agreed that Shihabi, a 62-year-old graduate of Princeton and Harvard Business School and the author of two books, is intelligent, driven, and commendably well-read.What they also agreed on was that he is aggressive, brash, and self-destructive.""Anything can set him off,"" Salem said in her deposition. ""It's even worse, actually, than [walking on] eggshells. It's like walking on grenades.""Abdo, the foundation employee, agreed in her deposition. ""He intimidated and bullied the staff all the time,"" she said, also calling him ""extremely domineering.""The senior academic told Insider: ""He's one of the most impulsive people I've dealt with in Washington. He's absolutely capable of saying 'you know what, comma, screw it.""Shihabi told Insider that in Washington, it is a case of eat or be eaten.""I had to be loud, brash, and aggressive since you cannot quickly make an impact in a place such as DC by being soft-spoken and timid,"" he said. ""After all, because I was advocating views that went directly against the dominant narrative, I had to forcefully impose these views onto the narrative, or else they never would have been heard.""Shihabi's dinners were well known in Washington, and not always for the right reasons.""He would insult people at the dinners, and they would leave in anger,"" Abdo said in her deposition. At one dinner, which featured Maksad and journalists from CNN and The Atlantic, Shihabi spent the meal ""essentially screaming at anyone who disagreed with him,"" the journalist Hassan Hassan, Salem's husband, said in his deposition.When asked by Insider, Shihabi said: ""My dinners were very popular in DC. I used to hold them often twice a month and if I had spent my time screaming at people I doubt they would have continued to attend.""When asked to summarize Shihabi's temperament, Gause told Insider: ""Ali doesn't mind a good fight.""Shihabi's hackles also raised when his staff went too far in criticizing MBS, according to Abdo in her deposition. Abdo said Shihabi once tried to block the publication of an article she had written for The Washington Post hours before it was set to publish because it didn't paint MBS in a positive light.Shihabi denied blocking the article. ""We never tried to block anything our people wrote because we were sensitive about exactly this accusation,"" he told Insider. Despite being a firm believer in MBS' vision, Shihabi's support for Saudi Arabia wasn't total. ""He was never a crude apologist, he was always a very sophisticated interpreter, explainer,"" Haykel said.Shihabi had long had issues with how the country was run, especially when it came to the religious establishment and government bureaucracy. In 1996, after the religious authorities banned sports for women, he left Saudi Arabia so his daughter could be schooled in Dubai.Shihabi now spends much of the year in Portugal, on the site of an avocado farm bought by his late father.He is still widely quoted in the US and world media, demystifying Saudi developments as they emerge, even as his plan to use his foundation to sway Washington in Riyadh's favor didn't go as planned.But those efforts did not go unnoticed. ""There were all kinds of offers made to him to be in Riyadh if he wanted to be,"" Haykel told Insider. In March 2020, Shihabi announced that he'd been appointed to the advisory board of Neom, a futuristic mega-city under construction in Saudi Arabia's northwest.Neom is the prized project and central pillar of MBS' ""Vision 2030"" for Saudi Arabia. Also on the board is Softbank founder Masayoshi Son. ""I think that tells you that Ali's still a valued human resource for the senior levels of the government,"" Ereli said. With the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks looming, Saudi Arabia remains a tricky sell in Washington. But it's a sure bet that Shihabi will keep trying.",https://i.insider.com/611fb1435c669d0019f00fc3?width=700,"Saudi Arabia, 20 years after 9/11: 'A country in the making' - Yahoo News
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The Saudi Arabia of today is far different from the Saudi Arabia of Sept. 11, 2001.All but four of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, and the Saudi kingdom was the birthplace of Osama bin Laden, the head of al-Qaida and mastermind of the attack 20 years ago. In the two decades since then, Saudi Arabia has confronted al-Qaida on its own soil, revamped its textbooks, worked to curb terror financing and partnered with the United States to counter terrorism.It wasn't until the last five years, though, that the kingdom began backing away from the religious ideology upon which it was founded and which it espoused within and outside its borders — Wahhabism, a strict interpretation of Islam that helped spawn generations of mujahedeen.For countless numbers of people in the United States, Saudi Arabia will forever be associated with 9/11, the collapse of the World Trade Towers and the deaths of nearly 3,000 people.To this day, victims’ families are trying to hold the Saudi government accountable in New York and have pushed President Joe Biden to  related to the attacks, despite Saudi government insistence that any allegation of complicity is ""categorically false.” Victims of a 2019  and their families are also suing Saudi Arabia for monetary damages, claiming the kingdom knew the Saudi Air Force officer had been radicalized and could have prevented the killings.Saudi Arabia's close partnership with the United States, including the presence of American troops in the kingdom after the first Gulf War, made its leadership a target of extremist groups.“It is important to realize that the terrorists who struck the U.S. on September 11 have also targeted Saudi Arabia’s people, leadership, military personnel and even our holiest religious sites in Mecca and Medina on multiple occasions,” Fahad Nazer, the Saudi Embassy spokesperson in Washington, told The Associated Press. He said Saudi-U.S. counterterrorism work has saved thousands of lives.Yet even as Saudi Arabia battled al-Qaida and later attacks by the IS group, the Al Saud rulers continued to give ultraconservative clerics monopoly over preaching and influence over society in exchange for their staunch backing of the monarchy.That decades-old pact unraveled before a roomful of foreign investors in 2017 when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  A year earlier, with backing from his father the king, the prince had  — the ones who would chase young Saudi men and women out of parks for mingling, go after cars playing music and force stores to close during the five daily prayers.“It’s a new country.

What has happened over the past 20 years in Saudi Arabia, Dergham says, has amounted to “a major cleanup of extremism ... and it has not been easy.""The crown prince doubled down in April of this year in remarks to Saudi TV. He said Saudi identity is built on its Islamic and Arab heritage. His words appeared to equate the two, and pointed to the broader effort the state has embarked on to affirm a national Saudi identity that is no longer tied to pan-Islamic causes nor the religious ideologies of Sheikh Mohammed Ibn Abdul-Wahhab, whose ultraconservative teachings of Islam in the 18th century are widely referred to by his name.“If Sheikh Mohammed Abdel-Wahhab came out of his grave and found us adhering to his text and closing our eyes to independent reasoning (ijtihad) or deifying him, he would be the first to oppose such a thing,” Prince Mohammed said.Ali Shihabi, who has ties to the royal court, says the kingdom's new tone signals to “any fence-sitting clerics"" that moderation is the only path to take going forward.Moderation, though, goes only so far. As Saudi Arabia works to alter perceptions and  for new generations of Saudis two decades after 9/11, it remains politically repressive.Prince Mohammed's rapid changes are part of a hurried effort that have coincided with him amassing power by sidelining rivals, like the country’s former counterterrorism czar, and clamping down hard on critics, including  in Turkey by agents who worked for the prince.Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar who served at the CIA for 30 years, says the U.S.-Saudi relationship has gone through fundamental changes over the years, but that even in the best of times “it’s a tough sell to portray Saudi Arabia as America’s best friend.”While Saudi Arabia remains far from an open society, the cloud of social restrictions that loomed over generations in the kingdom is dissipating. No longer are  eye-popping concerts, movie theaters and women driving impossible or illegal.“My own perspective is that there’s envy of the younger generation that get to have these opportunities,” says Hisham Fageeh, a 33-year-old Saudi filmmaker, actor and writer working in Los Angeles who grew up in the shadow of 9/11.But there are questions about where this new path will lead.“There’s multiple doors that people can walk through,” Fageeh says. ”The challenge is going to be, how do we integrate all our parts — our past, our present and our future?""In the two decades since 9/11, Saudi Arabia and the world have been reshaped by social media, the internet and global connectivity. In Saudi Arabia, though, there is also a massive generational shift taking hold. Well over a third of the population of Saudi Arabia is under 14, born years after 9/11. More than 60% are under 35.All came of age in the aftermath of the Sept. 11th attacks. They, like the 36-year-old crown prince, were not even born when the Shah of Iran was toppled in 1979 and replaced by an anti-U.S. and anti-Saudi Shiite regime. That same year, Sunni Muslim extremists laid siege to Mecca, Islam’s holiest site.Saudi rulers responded to the events of that year by empowering the state’s hardliners and allowing Wahhabism to further shape life in Saudi Arabia. A struggle for power between Saudi Arabia and Iran emerged, one that has continued to play out in sectarian proxy wars across the Middle East.As recently as the still-current Syrian civil war, Saudi Arabia and other Arab Gulf states either  to the arming, financing and recruitment of jihadi fighters who battled Shiite militias and Iran-backed fighters.But it was the shared effort of the United States, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in the 1980s that may be reverberating loudest today. Years before being stripped of his Saudi citizenship, bin Laden and other mujahedeen were armed and financed by the CIA and the kingdom to defeat the Soviets in Afghanistan during the Cold War.Years later, bin Laden would plot the 9/11 attacks from al-Qaida's base in Afghanistan, sheltered by the Taliban — the group that, as of a few weeks ago, are back in power.When judging Saudi Arabia, Dergham says, look at the wider strategic interests that have long underpinned U.S.-Saudi relations. “Americans just think Saudi Arabia equals 9/11,” she said. “You know, wake up and smell the roses. This has been a partnership, an alliance with the United States for years and years.”___Dubai-based Associated Press journalist Aya Batrawy covers Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia wants the U.S. to show that Washington is committed to the kingdom, and that means leaving American defense equipment in Saudi Arabia, Prince Turki Al-Faisal told CNBC.He was responding to a question on what the Middle East needs from the U.S. in the wake of the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan.""I think we need to be reassured about American commitment,"" the prince, Saudi Arabia's former intelligence chief, told CNBC's Hadley Gamble last month.""That looks like, for example, not withdrawing Patriot missiles from Saudi Arabia at a time when Saudi Arabia is the victim of missile attacks and drone attacks — not just from Yemen, but from Iran,"" he said. following attacks on the country's oil facilities. Washington blamed Iran for the strikes, though Tehran has denied the accusations.In June this year, multiple media outlets reported that the .Pulling Patriot missiles from the kingdom is ""not indicative of America's declared intention to help Saudi Arabia defend itself against outside enemies,"" Al-Faisal said, adding that he hopes the U.S. will give assurances of its commitment to deploy ""whatever is needed"" to help.Prince Turki said Saudi Arabia would prefer U.S. assistance, but sought ""other support"" to bolster its air defenses against attacks from Iran and the Houthis in Yemen.The kingdom said it intercepted a Houthi ballistic missile and armed drones that were fired on Saturday.A coalition led by Saudi Arabia  in what is seen as a proxy war with Iran.Al-Faisal said the U.S. should seriously consider showing support for the Middle East now, especially after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and the ongoing crisis in Kabul.Frederick Kempe, president of the Atlantic Council, wrote in an op-ed on CNBC that the situation in Afghanistan threatens U.S. President Joe Biden's narrative that Washington is ""once again a reliable ally and partner, following the uncertainties that grew among them during the Trump administration.""Biden was .Prince Turki said beyond Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf states are ""equally vulnerable"" and the U.S. should consider reassuring the Middle East that it can be relied on.""Whether the Biden administration will come through with that — I have no idea,"" he said.Separately, U.S. President Joe Biden has ordered the widespread declassification of documents relating to the September 11, 2001 attacks. In an executive order signed on Sept. 3, Biden said information should only remain classified if its release would pose a clear national security threat.Families of the victims believe the documents may contain details that implicate Saudi Arabian leaders.The kingdom's embassy in the U.S. on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia has consistently called for the release of all investigation materials and welcomes the release of the documents.The statement added that any allegation of Saudi Arabia being ""complicit in the September 11 attacks is categorically false.""""Saudi Arabia can only reiterate its longstanding support for the full declassification of any documents and materials relating to the United States' investigation of the terrorist attacks, with the hope that a full release of these documents will end the baseless allegations against the Kingdom once and for all,"" it said.Family members of 9/11 victims said in an August statement that ""much investigative evidence has been uncovered implicating Saudi government officials in supporting the attacks"" since the conclusion of the 9/11 Commission in 2004, NBC News reported.Most of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, and previous reports have found that Saudi nationals funded Al-Qaeda. The government has denied connection to the attacks.Prince Turki in August said Saudi Arabia has ""never hidden anything about"" 9/11.""If there are still documents within U.S. archives that have not been put to the public, I think they should be brought out because there will be nothing in them whatsoever,"" he said, adding that the kingdom conducted its own investigations and ""found absolutely nothing.""— CNBC's Christina Wilkie and Amanda Macias contributed to this report.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
