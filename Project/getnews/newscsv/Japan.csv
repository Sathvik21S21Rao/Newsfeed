"Rams HC Sean McVay on upset loss to 49ers: 'This was a humbling night' - NFL.com
NFL.com Digital Content EditorThough the game was in Santa Clara, California, it certainly had the feel of a Hollywood premiere.Under the Monday night lights and upon the prime-time stage, Odell Beckham and Von Miller made their Los Angeles Rams debuts.However, as the Rams were ready to roll out the red carpet, the underdog San Francisco 49ers were hardly ready to roll over and showed it with a physical, run-based attack from the start that led them to a 31-10 upset.""This was a humbling night for us,"" Rams head coach Sean McVay said.All in on their Super Bowl aspirations, the Rams (7-3) are sitting in second place in the NFC West after losing to the rival 49ers (4-5) for the fifth straight time.Not only was it an upset loss, but it was one in which the 49ers grounded and pounded their way to victory, running the ball 44 times for 156 yards. They were more often than not the more physical team on each side of the ball and it showed from the onset, when San Francisco took over after a Jimmie Ward interception and proceeded to run it right down the Rams' throats for a 7-0 lead it would never relinquish.It was an 18-play, 93-yard odyssey of an opening drive for the 49ers that took 11 minutes, 3 seconds of game clock and perhaps took something more from the Rams.""It's the way we want to do it,"" said 49ers quarterback Jimmy GaroppoloÔªø, who ended the opening march with an 8-yard touchdown pass to George KittleÔªø. ""I don't want to say it took their soul away, but it definitely did something.""Following that soul-crushing opening salvo by the 49ers, Ward had yet another interception, returning this one for a touchdown when a Matthew Stafford pass was dropped by Tyler Higbee and cradled by Ward. The start was emphatic and methodical, and quick and staggering.""We wanted to make it as physical as possible and we knew if we did that, it would come down to the turnover battle,"" said 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan, whose team won the turnover battle, 2-0, thanks to Ward's two interceptions.The 49ers had forced their will, while the Rams seemed to have lost theirs.It was hardly following the script, as the 49ers, reeling all season, were supposed to be the first foe vanquished by the new-age band of Rams with Beckham and Miller adding to the all-star cast that is the Los Angeles roster. But it didn't go that way.Los Angeles, despite its additions over the last few weeks, has lost two in row to the Titans and 49ers, with each defeat coming by double-digit margins and the Rams' high-octane offense held to an average of 13 points.""I choose to believe that these last couple weeks are not who we are. I refuse to believe that, event that, you know what, you're only as good as your last game,"" McVay said. ""These last two weeks have certainly been humbling.""Heading into Monday, this game was very much all about the Rams and the hopeful debuts of Miller and Beckham, but the Niners apparently didn't get the memo.Stafford wasted no time in getting Beckham introduced to the Rams offense, hooking up with the former Browns and Giants wideout on the first play from scrimmage for a 5-yard gain. Unfortunately, Beckham tallied his first tackle as a Ram on the drive when a Stafford deep ball was intercepted. It appeared that Beckham and Stafford might not have been on the same page on the play. Perhaps Beckham didn't run the deep route Stafford expected or perhaps it was just a bad ball.""We didn't make enough plays,"" said McVay, whose team lost the time of possession battle, 39:03-20:57. ""Our best players didn't play up to their standards.""Stafford hooked up with Higbee for the Rams' only touchdown of the evening to cut the score to 14-7, but the 49ers responded with an 11-play, 91-yard scoring drive, underscoring that this was San Francisco's night and their style of game.""We were ready to play them today and we were excited to,"" Shanahan said.At one point, Jalen Ramsey could be seen yelling on the sidelines, while Miller was getting oxygen on the bench.When the loss had settled, Beckham and Miller, each downplayed it, simply chalking it up to a bad night against a team that played better.""Any given Sunday any team can win,"" Beckham said. ""Tonight, the Niners came out and they played better than us in all phases of the game. And that's really the moral of the story. There's no trying to find what happened, they just outplayed us.""Plenty of eyes were on Beckham, though. In six games with the Browns this season, he averaged 2.8 catches on 5.7 targets for 38.7 yards per game. In his Rams debut, he had two catches on three targets for 18 yards.""I was excited. Felt like I was ready for the moment,"" Beckham said. ""I've been through so much and God has put me in this position for that exact moment. And it just wasn't our night. There's really no way around it, it just wasn't our night.""""It's definitely been a movie, it's definitely been a good movie. Today was a bad scene, but I feel like we'll be able to fight out of this, I feel like we'll be able to recover from this,"" Miller said. ""But having Odell on this team, it's great. That's my buddy, on an off the football field. We continue to gel, I continue to gel. And I'm exciting. Losing is definitely not fun, but playing today was fun. Going out there and feeling myself move around and be quick and have some great rushes; I had fun today. I'm gonna gather myself, take the good and the bad and go into this bye week and figure it out. I feel excited about this football team, I feel excited about what we can do.""This one definitely went off-script.The 49ers aren't yet done this season and the Rams clearly haven't won the Super Bowl in November no matter how many big names they have on their roster.As Monday night beckoned, everyone was tuning in to see the new-look Rams, the star-studded Super Bowl contenders.When Monday night concluded, everyone saw the 49ers that many envisioned would be Super Bowl contenders before the season began.Said McVay: ""It's only going to take as much of a toll as we allow it to.""Said Shanahan: ""We need to start expecting some more games like that.""Once upon a time in the wild NFC West, things got a whole lot more interesting on Monday night.See all the ActionReplay every game all season.",https://res.cloudinary.com/stage-nflclubs/image/upload/49ers/f6b7udz3xm3jglfakq9q.svg,"China pleads ignorance amid calls to investigate tennis star Peng Shuai's whereabouts after sexual assault claim - Yahoo Sports

He added: ""This is is not a diplomatic question"" and made no further comment on the subject. following an allegation by Peng that a retired government official sexually assaulted her.

It‚Äôs hard to believe it, but a month has already passed in the 2021-22 NBA season. And even though the Golden State Warriors enter the second month of action coming off of a loss, they‚Äôre feeling pretty darn good about their record.They‚Äôve been the best team in the NBA through the first four weeks, and that‚Äôs without Klay Thompson. Permission for optimism granted.Now let‚Äôs recap the week that was, and look forward to the week that will be.Record: 11-2Standing: 1st seed in the Western ConferenceOffensive rating: 3rd (112.9)Defensive rating: 1st (100.4)Net rating: 1st (+12.5)Team ratings are garbage-time adjusted, courtesy of Cleaning The Glass.Monday: Wednesday: Friday: Sunday: Three wins by a combined 53 points, and a lone four-point loss? If you can‚Äôt have a perfect week, that‚Äôs perhaps the next best thing. The Dubs certainly started things in style with a trio of dominant victories, culminating in a 26-point beatdown of the Chicago Bulls, who look like a team capable of making a deep playoff run.So the week ended in defeat ... who cares? They happen. We‚Äôll take three big steps forward and one little step back every week of the season. Steph Curry vs. the Hawks: 50 points, 7 rebounds, 10 assists, 4 steals, 1 block, 14-for-28 shooting, 9-for-19 threes, 13-for-13 free throws.Curry had a few low-scoring games as the Dubs coasted to victories, and then he took matters into his own hands against Atlanta, as if to remind everyone who he is, and what he‚Äôs capable of. And my goodness is he capable of a lot. 50 points and 10 assists? Plus an overflowing handful of rebounds from the point guard position, and a stellar defensive game?It was the best performance of the season. Not for Curry. Not for the Warriors. For the NBA. Honorable mention goes to...Andrew Wiggins vs. the Wolves: 35 points, 4 rebounds, 2 steals, 14-for-19 shooting, 3-for-6 threes, 4-for-4 free throws.Did Wiggins decide to take something out on his former team, or did he just happen to have  one of his best games in a Warriors jersey against the organization he played the first 442 games of his career for? We may never know, but what matters is he was utterly unstoppable on offense.And while we‚Äôre on the topic of Wiggins being unstoppable against the Timberwolves...OH MY WIGGINS Yeah, we‚Äôre gonna need to see some alternate angles and bench reactions for that one ...ARE YOU KIDDING ANDREW WIGGINS?!

But when you look at the quality of the teams the Warriors are up against, the Pistons stand out a bit, and not in the good way.Truthfully, Detroit already having three wins is a bit surprising to me, though it‚Äôs worth noting that two of their wins (against the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic) came against two of the only three teams with a worse record.Detroit is running with a starting lineup of Killian Hayes, Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, and Isaiah Stewart. If you‚Äôre familiar with those five players, then congratulations: you are a hard, hardcore NBA fan.Tuesday vs. the Nets.Is this even a question? The Nets have the fourth-best record in the league, and the fifth-best net rating.More importantly, they have Kevin Durant and James Harden. , the community correctly predicted a 3-1 week, with 46% of poll responders choosing that option. It was close though, as 39% of fans thought the Dubs would sweep the week, while 12% saw them going 2-2.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cSmEtqI5HCx8KOQFrkcVOy9vG7c=/0x0:2017x3025/1200x800/filters:focal(1024x434:1346x756)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70147253/1148073672.0.jpg,"College Football Expert Picks, Predictions: Week 12 - College Football News

"Booster shots against COVID-19 'are a bit of a distraction,' doctor says - AOL
While COVID-19 booster shot eligibility is continuing to expand in the U.S., not all doctors believe that‚Äôs where the focus should be in the fight against the coronavirus.‚ÄúHonestly, I think that boosters right now are a bit of a distraction away from where we should be focused, which is getting first doses, especially since we know that even now, even with Delta surging, the primary doses of the vaccines are highly protective against serious infection, against hospitalization,‚Äù Dr. Anand Swaminathan, a New Jersey-based emergency medicine physician, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).In most states, booster shots are available for those over the age of 65, people with certain underlying medical conditions, and people working in occupations considered to be higher risk in accordance with CDC guidelines.‚ÄúThese boosters will temporarily increase the antibodies that are circulating which then temporarily will improve our effectiveness against fighting COVID in any form,‚Äù Swaminathan said. ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt really give us the long-term immunity that we‚Äôre looking for, doesn‚Äôt really boost that as much, or at least we don‚Äôt know that it does.""Currently, 58.5% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated while 67.7% have received at least one dose. (13.4% of those who are fully vaccinated have received a booster shot.)¬†As part of an effort to ramp up vaccinations, President Biden recently announced that companies with more than 100 employees will need to require their workers to get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. The requirement is currently blocked by a federal appeals court.This comes as the country recently surpassed 46.6 million coronavirus cases and 755,000 deaths. A report out of Texas found that unvaccinated individuals in the state were 40 times more likely to die from COVID in 2021 than those who were fully vaccinated.But breakthrough cases have become more common due to the virulence of the Delta variant, which is where booster shots come into the conversation.¬†Though extensive details haven't been shared yet, preliminary data from Pfizer indicated that ""receiving an additional booster dose of their COVID-19 vaccine after having had the initial two doses increases the amount of Delta variant antibodies five-fold in 18- to 55-year-olds and 11-fold in 65- to 85-year-olds,"" according to Medical News Today.However, Swaminathan doesn‚Äôt think that boosters are ‚Äúreally going to affect very much‚Äù for several reasons.‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre looking to prevent is the hospitalizations and the serious infections, and we don‚Äôt know that boosters really do that,‚Äù Swaminathan said. ‚ÄúOn top of that, we‚Äôve got some data out of the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that the groups of people that are getting boosters tend to be higher socioeconomic status, they tend to be whiter, they tend to be older.‚ÄùAnd with the exception of those who are older, he added, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not really seeing booster uptake being very high in the higher-risk population. So boosters aren‚Äôt really getting to those that are higher risk.‚ÄùRather than using resources towards distributing booster shots that may not be fully effective, efforts should be directed towards getting first doses in individuals both in the U.S. and around the world, Swaminathan argued.‚ÄúRight now, the U.S. is administering more boosters than many countries are administering any kind of vaccine, any level of vaccination,‚Äù Swaminathan said. ‚ÄúAnd until we get better vaccine equity globally, we‚Äôre not really going to be able to fight this pandemic. We‚Äôre going to see more deaths and more dangerous variants.‚ÄùAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

Alec Baldwin is being made a scapegoat in the fatal ""Rust"" shooting because of political views ... at least according to his brother.Daniel Baldwin appeared Monday on ""The Domenick Nati Show"" ... and during the radio hit, he said his brother should NOT be taking the blame for the fatal incident on set.The way Daniel sees it ... Alec is being scapegoated because he's the big star with outspoken political views, making for an easy target.Daniel says ... ""You know Alec's got the name though doesn't he, so let's go ahead and take Alec for his political views and the many, many wonderful things he's done for different charities and people and his wife and let's see if we can't sensationalize this and go after Alec.""DB adds ... ""This is what he faces because he's opinionated and he's strong-headed and he has really staunch views on certain things and those people who don't like him will take advantage of him and persecute his wife. He's a target.""How very Christian of you. While Daniel doesn't go into Alec's political views, it's no secret Alec did not like Donald Trump, often imitating the former President on 'SNL,' and endorsing Barack Obama back in the day.Remember ... one of the first to publicly pile on Alec was Donald Trump Jr., who posted t-shirts reading, ""Guns don't kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people.""While it seems Don Jr.'s actions support Daniel's scapegoating theory, it's worth noting the District Attorney investigating the case in New Mexico, Mary Carmack-Altwies, is a Democrat.Instead, Daniel says the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is responsible for the death of Halyna Hutchins ... along with assistant director Dave Halls.In Daniel's eyes, Alec is exonerated by the fact folks on set told police Halls announced the gun he handed AB was ""cold,"" meaning it did not have live ammunition.As you know it was a fatal mistake ... the revolver in Alec's hands turned out to have live ammo.Daniel says the buck stops with the armorer, but he's wondering why Halls said it was a ""cold"" gun if Halls didn't verify it ... and he thinks it's clear rules weren't being followed on set.Daniel says Alec really liked Halyna and had spent some time with her family ... and we saw Alec with the family in the wake of the shooting.No charges have been filed and no arrests have been made ... but Daniel believes when the dust settles AB won't be the one going to jail.Bottom line for Daniel ... the actors are just on set to act, and they're not the ones responsible for guns on set.",https://imagez.tmz.com/image/69/4by3/2021/11/16/693b52d974b4450da2be69cfac4347f6_md.jpg
"NASA will spend $93 billion on Artemis moon program by 2025, report estimates - Space.com
Putting boots on the moon is an expensive proposition.NASA's spending on its Artemis program, which aims to establish a sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the decade, is projected to reach a total of $93 billion by 2025, according to a new audit by the NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG).""Moreover, while NASA has several initiatives underway aimed at increasing affordability, we project the current production cost of a single SLS/Orion system to be $4.1 billion per launch,"" the OIG report states, referring to the Orion crew capsule and Space Launch System rocket, which are core Artemis elements.""Looking ahead, without capturing, accurately reporting and reducing the cost of future SLS/Orion missions, the Agency will face significant challenges to sustaining its Artemis program in its current configuration,"" adds the 73-page report, which was released Monday (Nov. 15).For comparison, the U.S. spent $28 billion on NASA's Apollo moon program between 1960 and 1973, . That's about $280 billion in today's dollars.Related:Although the Artemis program was first announced in December 2017, development of Orion and the SLS officially began in 2011. So the OIG report's $93 billion estimate encompasses more than a decade of spending, from fiscal year (FY) 2012 through fiscal year 2025. (On the U.S. government's calendar, fiscal years start on Oct. 1 and end on Sept. 30. FY2012, for example, began on Oct. 1, 2011.)The original plan to return to the moon called for landing astronauts near the moon's south pole for the first time by 2028. In March 2019, however, the administration of President Donald Trump accelerated things, re-targeting the first crewed lunar landing since the Apollo days for 2024 and dubbing the initiative the Artemis program.That revised timeline was widely viewed within the space community as overly ambitious, and NASA is no longer working toward it: Last week, agency chief Bill Nelson announced that the first crewed Artemis landing will likely take place no earlier than 2025.And 2025 may be out of reach as well. The new OIG report, which was apparently written before Nelson's announcement, estimates that NASA will miss the Trump administration's late-2024 landing goal ""by several years."" The audit cites the need to develop and test new Artemis spacesuits, which are behind schedule, and the program's Human Landing System (HLS), which will ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface.In April 2021, NASA selected SpaceX to provide the initial Artemis HLS, which will be a version of the company's huge Starship vehicle. However, two companies that lost out on the HLS contract, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Dynetics, filed protests with the OIG just after the award was announced. Those protests were denied in July, but Blue Origin then filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed earlier this month. So work under the Starship HLS contract is basically just now getting started.¬†‚ÄîNASA's Artemis program 
‚Äî 
‚ÄîThe first crewed Artemis landing mission is called Artemis 3, because it will be the third launch in the program. The first, Artemis 1, will send an uncrewed Orion on a journey around the moon. Artemis 2 will also be a circumlunar mission, but with astronauts aboard.¬†NASA is targeting February 2022 for the launch of Artemis 1. But the OIG report is less bullish, estimating that the mission ""will be ready to launch by summer 2022.""Such Artemis delays have multiple causes, according to the report, from technical challenges to the COVID-19 pandemic to extreme weather events. This past August, for example,  in Louisiana, which builds the core stage for the SLS.In addition, the HLS and another Artemis element, the moon-orbiting space station known as Gateway, received less money from Congress in FY2021 ""than required to meet NASA‚Äôs initial acquisition strategy,"" the report notes.The OIG report makes nine recommendations to Jim Free, who as NASA's associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Development (ESD) Mission Directorate is overseeing Artemis. This advice is designed to improve the ""accuracy, transparency and safety of human spaceflight.""¬†The space agency concurred completely or partially with all but two of the recommendations. Those two were ""develop an Artemis-wide cost estimate and update it on an annual basis"" and ""maintain an accounting of per-mission costs and establish a benchmark against which NASA can assess the outcome of initiatives to increase the affordability of ESD systems.""The new audit focuses on the Artemis program's schedule, its projected costs and how NASA's acquisition and programmatic strategies affect the coming moonshot. It was conducted from December 2020 through November 2021, OIG officials said.The new report is the second in a series directly assessing the Artemis program.

Within a diamond hauled from deep beneath Earth's surface, scientists have discovered the first example of a never-before-seen mineral.Named davemaoite after prominent geophysicist Ho-kwang (Dave) Mao, the mineral is the first example of a high-pressure calcium silicate perovskite (CaSiO3) found on Earth. Another form of CaSiO3, known as wollastonite, is commonly found across the globe, but davemaoite has a crystalline structure that forms only under high pressure and high temperatures in Earth's mantle, the mainly solid layer of Earth trapped between the outer core and the crust.Davemaoite has long been expected to be an abundant and geochemically important mineral in Earth's mantle. But scientists have never found any direct evidence of its existence because it breaks down into other minerals when it moves toward the surface and pressure decreases. However, analysis of a diamond from Botswana, which formed in the mantle around 410 miles (660 kilometers) below Earth's surface, has revealed a sample of intact davemaoite trapped inside. As a result, the International Mineralogical Association has now confirmed davemaoite as a new mineral.Related: ""The discovery of davemaoite came as a surprise,"" lead author Oliver Tschauner, a mineralogist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told Live Science.¬†Tschauner and his colleagues uncovered the davemaoite sample with a technique known as synchrotron X-ray diffraction, which focuses a high-energy beam of X-rays on certain spots within the diamond with microscopic precision. By measuring the angle and intensity of the returning light, researchers can decipher what's inside, Tschauner said. The sample of davemaoite within the diamond was just a few micrometers (millionths of a meter) in size, so less-powerful sampling techniques would have missed it, he added.Davemaoite is believed to play an important geochemical role in Earth's mantle. Scientists theorize that the mineral may also contain other trace elements, including uranium and thorium, which release heat via radioactive decay. Therefore, davemaoite may help to generate a substantial amount of heat in the mantle, Tschauner said.In a 2014 study published in the journal Science, researchers described another theoretical high-pressure mineral from the mantle, known as bridgmanite. However, the sample of bridgmanite did not originate from the mantle but rather inside a meteorite. The discovery of davemaoite shows that diamonds can form farther down in the mantle than previously thought, and it suggests that they might be the best place to look for more new minerals from the mantle, Tschauner said.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî""The work by Tschauner et al. inspires hope in the discovery of other difficult high-pressure phases in nature,"" Yingwei Fe, a geophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the study, said in a related Science article. ""Such direct sampling of the inaccessible lower mantle would fill our knowledge gap in chemical composition of the entire mantle of our planet.""The study was published online Nov. 11 in the journal Science.Originally published on Live Science. to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

It might be hotter than lava but superionic ice is not on fire.¬†Image Credit: Stewart Scott/Shutterstock.comIf you think of very low temperatures, there's a good chance you are picturing ice. Ice is a quintessential ""cold"" thing for us. But at extreme pressures, like in the core of large planets, something peculiar can happen. Ice can remain solid but have a temperature hotter than the surface of the Sun.This type of water ice is called ""superionic ice"" and has been added to the list of around 20 phases water can structurally form, including ice, liquid, and vapor. Now, researchers report in Nature Physics¬†the discovery and characterization of two superionic ice phases, having found a way of reliably and stably recreating the ice for longer than¬†has¬†previously been achieved¬†to be able to study it.¬†One superionic phase extends between 200,000 and 600,00 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level and at a temperature of several hundred to over 1,000¬∞C. The other phase extends to half the pressure experienced at the center of the Earth and with temperatures of thousands of degrees.‚ÄúIt was a surprise ‚Äî everyone thought this phase wouldn‚Äôt appear until you are at much higher pressures than where we first find it,‚Äù co-author Vitali Prakapenka, a University of Chicago research professor and beamline scientist at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory, said in a statement. ‚ÄúBut we were able to very accurately map the properties of this new ice, which constitutes a new phase of matter, thanks to several powerful tools.‚ÄùAt higher temperatures and incredible pressures, the ice remains solid but the atomic structure is dramatically shifted. Once the pressure and temperature are removed though, the ice return to its regular state.‚ÄúImagine a cube, a lattice with oxygen atoms at the corners connected by hydrogen,‚Äù Prakapenka said. ‚ÄúWhen it transforms into this new superionic phase, the lattice expands, allowing the hydrogen atoms to migrate around while the oxygen atoms remain steady in their positions. It‚Äôs kind of like a solid oxygen lattice sitting in an ocean of floating hydrogen atoms.‚ÄùSuperionic ice is less dense than regular ice, which we know already to be less dense than liquid water. It also changes color. While water ice can be transparent to cloudy white, depending on how it freezes, superionic ice is darker as it interacts with light differently.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new state of matter, so it basically acts as a new material, and it may be different from what we thought,‚Äù Prakapenka said.Planetary scientists believe similar extreme conditions in pressure and temperatures might exist inside Neptune and Uranus, as well as other ice giant planets beyond the Solar System. Understanding the properties of superionic ice might help us understand the properties of these planets.This website uses cookiesThis website uses cookies to improve user experience.

"Watch the Xbox 20th anniversary event here at 1PM ET - Engadget
Exactly 20 years ago today, Microsoft . At the time, it was hard to know how integral the company would become to the gaming landscape. Sure, Microsoft had played an important part in the development of PC gaming, but up to that point the console market had been dominated almost exclusively by Nintendo and Sony. Now in its fourth generation, the Xbox brand has never been stronger, in part thanks to smart decisions around Game Pass and studio acquisitions.¬†At 1PM ET, Microsoft will look back and celebrate the history of the Xbox brand while likely looking to the future as well.

            It's been a year since , complete with an actual UI, app support, and a physical remote. , it's remained one of our favorite ways to watch movies and shows from all of those streaming services you keep meaning to cancel. Now, a new method for installing apps to your streaming box makes it even easier to access more content.
    
            As spotted by Reddit user u/avigi, the Play Store on Android now supports remote installations directly to any Android TV device. While it's been possible to push apps to Chromecasts and Shield TVs from the web interface, this marks the first time the ability has made the jump to smartphones. It's similar to how Wear OS apps work on the Play Store, .
    
            Thanks to some additional screenshots from user u/kevjs1982, we can see what the UI looks like when you have apps installed on various devices. If it's already on your phone, the Play Store will give you a link to send it directly to your Android TV gadget. If it's already on your streaming stick, the usual ""Install"" button appears instead. Finally, if it's on both your phone and television, Google marks the app as ""Installed on all devices.""
    
            It seems like this is another one of Google's classic server-side updates, as not every phone has access to these options just yet. It's the perfect tool for Chromecast with Google TV owners looking for a more straightforward method for finding new software ‚Äî , of course.
