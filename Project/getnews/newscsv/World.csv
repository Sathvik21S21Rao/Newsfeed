United States President Joe Biden said on Thursday the US military would complete its withdrawal from Afghanistan by August 31, ahead of schedule, and dismissed mounting concerns about a civil war developing in the country occupied by the US since 2001.“The mission is accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and that terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” Biden insisted, defending his decision to keep up the rapid US withdrawal in the face of widening Taliban attacks on Afghan forces.The US invaded Afghanistan after the al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. The US has withdrawn approximately 3,500 remaining troops in a process the US military now says is 90 percent complete.“Our military commanders advised me that once I made the decision to end the war, we needed to move swiftly,” Biden said.“In this context speed is safety,” said the president, who is commander-in-chief of the military in the US system of government and holds ultimate authority over the deployment of troops.The US will continue to have a few hundred troops in Afghanistan to maintain security for the US embassy and diplomatic community in Kabul as well as the city’s airport. And US officials have said the military will maintain an “over-the-horizon” capability to respond to events.The US withdrawal follows a US agreement reached under former President Donald Trump in talks headed by US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad with the Taliban in Qatar. The US agreed that US and foreign forces would leave by May 1. In exchange, the Taliban promised to negotiate a peace agreement with the Western-backed government in Kabul.Afghan commando forces armoured convoy leaves towards the front line, at the Ghorband District, Parwan Province, Afghanistan on June 29 [Omar Sobhani/Reuters]When Biden came to office in January he was confronted with a stark choice of following through on the agreement with the Taliban or seeing US forces drawn back into a widening war.Biden said on Thursday he and his top advisers had concluded the only path to peace and stability in Afghanistan is through a negotiated agreement between the Western-backed Afghan government in Kabul, regional leaders and the Taliban.“We did not go into Afghanistan to nation-build,” the president said.In the first significant peace talks between the Kabul government and the Taliban in months, a government delegation met Taliban representatives in Tehran on July 8. The two warring sides  that said “war is not the solution to the Afghanistan problem.”It came as the Taliban claimed to have captured a main border crossing with Iran Thursday, with the Taliban spokesman posting a video showing purported fighters taking the Islam Qala border crossing and being welcomed by local residents. It would be the third international border the group has seized, as its fighters take territory around the country.A Pentagon spokesman said on Thursday that Taliban fighters had  in Afghanistan.“They have taken dozens of district centres, that is true. And we believe that they mean to threaten provincial centres as well,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said.A defensive Biden batted back several shouted questions from reporters at the White House, rejecting comparisons to the US departure from Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war.“No. No, no, no,” Biden says when asked if the US bears responsibility for Afghan lives lost post-withdrawal.“It’s up to the people of Afghanistan to decide what government they want, not to impose the government upon them.”Afghan government delegation and Taliban representatives held a meeting in Tehran [Iran foreign ministry handout/via EPA-EFE]Biden denied that US intelligence agencies have concluded that the Afghan government will fall to the Taliban without the presence of US forces. Biden met at the White House with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and national council chairman Abdullah Abdullah on June 25 and pledged continuing US financial and diplomatic support for the government.The Afghan army is well trained and equipped, Biden said, and a Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is not inevitable. The US has trained and equipped more than 300,000 Afghan soldiers and police although the Afghan military still relies on the US and foreign contractors for air support.“I do not trust the Taliban but I trust the capacity of the Afghan military,” Biden said.Biden offered a message to interpreters and other Afghans who worked with troops: “There is a home for you in the United States, if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.”Congress is advancing legislation that Biden supports to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to re-locating potential thousands of Afghans and their families to US territory, potentially the Pacifica island of Guam.Prime minister announces withdrawal as senior British military official warns that country may descend to civil war.The Taliban is taking control of more areas as Afghan soldiers flee the country.Taliban captures districts in Badakhshan and Kandahar provinces as Afghan troops flee into neighbouring Tajikistan.Withdrawal a clear indication that the last of 2,500-3,500 US troops have left Afghanistan or are nearing a departure.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"COVID global toll hits 4 million as vaccine rollouts race the Delta variant - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, The global death toll from COVID-19 has eclipsed 4 million as the crisis evolves into a race between the vaccine and the highly contagious Delta variant.The tally of lives lost over the past 18 months, as compiled from official sources by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the number of people killed in battle in all of the world’s wars since 1982, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo.A woman breaks down as she prays before the cremation of a relative who died of COVID-19 in Gauhati, India, on July 2, 2021. Credit:AP The toll is three times the number of people killed in traffic accidents around the world every year. It is about equal to the population of Los Angeles.Even then, it is widely believed to be an undercount because of overlooked cases or deliberate concealment.With the advent of COVID vaccines, deaths per day have plummeted to about 7900, after topping out at more than 18,000 a day in January.But in recent weeks, the Delta mutation first identified in India has set off alarms around the world, spreading rapidly even in vaccination success stories such as the US, Britain and Israel.Britain recorded a one-day total this week of more than 30,000 new infections for the first time since January, even as the government prepares to lift all remaining restrictions in England later this month.The World Health Organisation on Wednesday  so as “not to lose the gains you’ve made”.WHO’s emergencies chief Dr Michael Ryan said the accelerating infections of the Delta variant around the world meant it was too soon to abandon all precautions.“The idea that everyone is protected, and it’s ‘Kumbaya’ and everything goes back to normal, I think right now is a very dangerous assumption anywhere in the world, and it’s still a dangerous assumption in the European environment,” he told reporters during a briefing from Geneva.“We would ask governments at this moment not to lose the gains you’ve made.”Many countries have reimposed lockdowns and authorities are rushing to step up the campaign to dispense shots.At the same time, the disaster has exposed the gap between the haves and the have-nots, with vaccination drives barely getting started in Africa and other desperately poor corners of the world because of extreme shortages of shots.The US and other wealthy countries have agreed to share at least 1 billion doses with struggling countries.The US has the world’s highest reported death toll, at more than 600,000, or nearly one in seven deaths recorded in that time frame, followed by Brazil at more than 520,000, though the real numbers are believed to be much higher in Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro has long downplayed the virus.The variants, uneven access to vaccines and the relaxation of precautions in wealthier countries are “a toxic combination that is very dangerous”, warned Ann Lindstrand, a top immunisation official at the World Health Organisation.Instead of treating the crisis as a “me-and-myself-and-my-country” problem, she said, “we need to get serious that this is a worldwide problem that needs worldwide solutions”.“Vaccine equity is the greatest immediate moral test of our times,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement, marking the gloomy milestone.Gravediggers carry the coffin of 89-year-old Irodina Pinto Ribeiro, who died from COVID-19 related complications, at the Inhauma cemetery in Rio de Janeiro in June.Credit:AP “It is also a practical necessity.

"Who killed Haiti President Jovenel Moise? Everything we know so far - Moneycontrol
The assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise has plunged the impoverished Caribbean nation into crisis. Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph, who confirmed the killing, said the police and military were in control of security in Haiti.Mose was killed a day after he nominated Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon, as the new Prime Minister. Joseph took over the job of interim prime minister in April following the resignation of the previous premier, Joseph Jouthe, the latest in a revolving door of prime ministers.In Pics | Prime Minister Narendra Modi has condoled the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and the attack on First Lady Martine Moïse of Haiti.""Saddened by the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse and the attack on First Lady Martine Moïse of Haiti. My Condolences to the family of President Moïse and the people of Haiti,"" Modi said in a tweet.Here's what we know so far about Haiti President Jovenel Moise's assassination: Moise was shot dead and his wife, Martine, was critically wounded. She was rushed to a local hospital and later evacuated to Miami for treatment.Read: Magistrate Carl Henry Destin said that Moise had been shot 12 times and his office and bedroom ransacked.The end date of Moise's mandate had been in dispute with the late president maintaining that his term of office ran until February 7, 2022, but others saying it ended on February 7, 2021, as per an AFP report.""It was a team of who carried out the operation to assassinate the president,"" the head of Haiti's National Police, Leon Charles said at the press conference in Port-au-Prince, as quoted by AFP.""We have arrested 15 Colombians and the two Americans of Haitian origin. Three Colombians have been killed while eight others are on the loose.""Previously authorities had said four of the suspects had been killed. Charles did not explain the discrepancy.Meanwhile, Taiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested on its embassy grounds after security discovered a group of armed men had broken into the courtyard of the property that had been shuttered ""for safety reasons"" after Moise's murder.The embassy gave permission to Haitian police to enter the grounds, said Joanne Ou, a spokeswoman for Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Colombia's defence minister Diego Molano said at least six members of the hit squad appeared to be Colombian ex-soldiers, and that he had ordered the army and police to help with the investigation.Moise had been governing by decree, without a parliament, since January 2020 and had named a new prime minister, Ariel Henry, on July 5, just two days before his death.Henry, who had not yet assumed his duties, was the seventh prime minister named by Moise in four years and is claiming that he -- not Joseph -- is the rightful premier.The assassination of the Haitian president has left the international community pondering the future of a country plagued by political instability, poverty and natural disasters.Fearing further unrest, the UN Security Council, the United States and European nations called for legislative and presidential elections to be held as scheduled on September 26.The international airport in Port-au-Prince was closed to prevent the assailants from fleeing the country.The neighboring Dominican Republic shut its border with Haiti and stepped up security along the frontier.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Bangladesh factory fire leaves 52 dead, dozens injured - The Indian Express
At least 52 people were killed and over 50 others injured in a massive fire that broke out at a six-storey juice factory outside Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka, according to media reports on Friday.The fire broke out at around 5 pm on Thursday at the Shezan juice factory in Naryanganj’s Rupganj, according to fire officials.It is suspected that the fire originated from the ground floor of the building and spread quickly due to the presence of chemicals and plastic bottles.Fifty-two people have died and over 50 others were injured in the fire, the Dhaka Tribune reported. Several workers jumped off the building to escape the devastating fire, it said.Eighteen firefighting units were struggling to douse the fire at the factory building of Hashem Foods Limited.People gathered in front of the building in search of their loved ones who are still missing. Of the many missing, the identities of 44 missing workers have been confirmed, the newspaper said.Rescued workers and relatives alleged that the front gate and only exit of the factory remained locked at the time of the fire. They also claimed that the building had no proper fire safety measures in place.Deputy Director of Narayanganj District Fire Service Abdullah Al Arefin said it will take some time to fully control the fire. “Until the fire is doused, it is not possible to say exactly how much damage has occurred and the cause of the fire,” he added.A five-member probe committee has been formed by the district administration to look into the incident.Bangladesh’s history of industrial disastersIn 2019, a fire in the oldest part of Dhaka a 400-year-old area cramped with apartments shops and warehouses left at least 67 people dead.

Its research suggested antibody levels jump markedly after a third dose, but it’s not yet clear if and when boosters might truly be needed, the drug-manufacturing company said.Pfizer’s chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, said the recently reported dip in the vaccine’s effectiveness in Israel was mostly due to infections in people who had been vaccinated in January or February. The country’s health ministry said vaccine effectiveness in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease fell to 64% in June.Pfizer’s own data from the United States showed an erosion of the vaccine’s efficacy to the mid-80s after six months, Dolsten said, against the variants circulating there in the spring.WHO Chief Scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan on Thursday said data on Bharat Biotech’s vaccine Covaxin looks good.

The Phase-3 trial data looks good, they’ve looked at the variants too, she said in an interview to CNBC-TV18. “The overall efficacy is quite high. The vaccine efficacy against the Delta variant is low but it is still quite good,” she said. The safety profile so far meets the WHO benchmarks, the scientist said.“We keep a close eye on all vaccines which have received emergency use listing. We continue to seek more data,” she said.Uttarakhand has reported its first case of Delta Plus mutant of COVID19 with one person having tested positive for the variant in Udham Singh Nagar district.

                    The Olympic Games will be held without spectators at venues in the capital and surrounding prefectures due to a rise in coronavirus infections, officials said Thursday, after organizers made the unprecedented decision just two weeks ahead of the opening of the event.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced Thursday that in Tokyo — where quasi-emergency measures are in place — a state of emergency will take effect Monday and last until Aug. 22.


“New cases in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area have been rising since June,” Suga said. “Stronger measures have become necessary in those areas, but could be lifted early if we see evidence of the positive impact of the vaccine rollout.”Meanwhile, the state of emergency was extended to mid-August for Okinawa Prefecture. Quasi-emergency measures will be extended for the same period in three of the capital’s neighboring prefectures — Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama — as well as Osaka, but will expire Sunday as planned in Hokkaido, Aichi, Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka prefectures.The ongoing state of emergency in Okinawa, as well as quasi-emergency measures in nine prefectures, were slated to expire Sunday.Dining establishments in Tokyo and Okinawa will be asked to stop serving alcohol and to close by 8 p.m. Attendance at events, which had been limited to 10,000 people, will be capped at 5,000 or 50% of venue capacity — whichever figure is lower — and the events themselves will need to end by 9 p.m.

The policy of barring spectators from venues in Tokyo — along with Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa prefectures — was agreed on at a meeting Thursday attended by International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach and representatives of the games organizing committee, the International Paralympic Committee, as well as the Japanese and Tokyo metropolitan governments.“It is extremely regrettable that the games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections,” said Seiko Hashimoto, president of the organizing committee. “I am very sorry for ticket holders and local residents who were looking forward to the games.”Limited numbers of spectators will be allowed at venues in Miyagi, Fukushima and Shizuoka prefectures, Hashimoto said.With the pandemic persisting in Japan and around the world, the promise made repeatedly by organizers and officials — that the Summer Games will signify humanity’s triumph over the virus — appears increasingly optimistic.Instead, the pandemic has forced organizers to cancel promotional events, reduce spectators and impose numerous restrictions on athletes flying in from countries all over the globe.“There’s a race between the vaccination of the public and the spread of the delta variant,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister leading the country’s virus response, said on Thursday, referring to a deadlier, more transmissible form of the coronavirus. “Until the vaccine rollout makes further progress, it’s crucial that foot traffic is kept low leading up to summer break and the Bon holidays.”While numbers of new cases are low in most parts of Japan, a resurgence is gaining momentum in large cities and highly populated areas.COVID-19 measures will be in place until Aug. 22, which is roughly two weeks after the Olympics end and two days before the beginning of the Paralympics.The Olympics will take place from July 23 to Aug. 8, followed by the Paralympics, which will run from Aug. 24 until Sept. 5.

With the rising numbers of cases in the capital, there is a looming fear that the Tokyo Games could become a massive superspreader event that would overwhelm its hospitals and scatter variants domestically and abroad.Tokyo reported 896 new cases Thursday, a day after the city logged 920, the highest daily count since mid-May.The number of hospitalized patients and patients with severe symptoms are increasing in Tokyo, while infections among people living together and coworkers sharing the same office space continue to account for the largest portion of traceable new cases.“The virus is undoubtedly rebounding in Tokyo,” said Norio Ohmagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine and a top adviser to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.If the current trajectory continues, Ohmagari said the capital could see more than 1,000 cases a day within three weeks, and more than 1,400 as soon as a month from now.“If foot traffic continues to increase and the delta variant is allowed to spread further, Tokyo could see an explosive increase in new cases,” he said.As of last Friday, Tokyo had reported 760 cases of the delta variant.

Organizers announced in June that attendance at competitive events during the games would be limited to 10,000 fans or half capacity, but the escalating outbreak in the capital has forced them to change plans.Meanwhile, virus measures for the Tokyo Games have already begun to fall apart at the seams, as a small but growing list of athletes, coaches and staff have tested positive for COVID-19.On Tuesday, the Tokyo Organising Committee announced that two staff at the athletes village tested positive earlier this month after eating dinner in a group of four people, with the other diners being staff and contract workers for the games.Twelve staff have tested positive for COVID-19 since July 1, the day virus protocols set forth by the organizing committee took effect.On Sunday, NHK reported that a Serbian athlete had tested positive upon landing at Haneda Airport.

Critics warn that, while the organizing committee’s coronavirus measures might look good on paper, in practice they will fall apart.The infections emerging among athletes and staff could foretell what is to come during the games.While efforts have been made to reduce the number of organizers and stakeholders from abroad, tens of thousands of athletes, coaches, staff, journalists and volunteers are expected to travel to Tokyo from around the world and within the country.The global death toll from COVID-19 reached 4 million on Thursday, even as several countries race to vaccinate their populations faster than the spread of new variants.Japan has traversed three states of emergency and four waves of the pandemic, each bigger than the last.Owing to the largely voluntary nature of the central government’s infectious disease measures, the diminishing impact of COVID-19 protocols has been a major concern since the beginning of the pandemic.Signs of a rebound began to emerge in the capital less than a week after the most recent state of emergency was replaced by quasi-emergency measures on June 21.New cases of COVID-19 as well as the delta variant and foot traffic in Tokyo have been increasing steadily ever since.“The situation is becoming increasingly severe,” Tokyo Gov.

"Bangkok and 9 provinces in lockdown from Jul 12 as COVID-19 cases surge, curfew imposed from 9pm onwards - CNA
BANGKOK: Bangkok and nine provinces will go into lockdown from Monday (Jul 12) as COVID-19 cases continue to surge in Thailand, the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) announced on Friday.Residents in Bangkok and its nearby provinces of Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan and Samut Sakhon, as well as those in Narathiwas, Pattani, Songkhla and Yala in the far south have been advised to stay at home from Monday and only go outside when it is necessary. According to CCSA assistant spokesperson Apisamai Srirangsan, a curfew will be imposed between 9pm and 4am in these ten provinces as the government tightened restrictions in high-risk areas. However, residents will still be able to leave their homes in case of emergency, work or medical visits.Educational institutes in these provinces are required to conduct online classes only, Ms Apisamai said, adding that checkpoints and patrols will be set up by security units to ensure public movement is minimal.For Bangkok and its nearby provinces, convenience stores and markets will need to close from 8pm to 4am. The government also ordered temporary closure of department stores and community malls in these six provinces, except the supermarket and pharmaceutical sections, restaurants and cafes, banks, as well as areas designated for the national vaccination programme, which will be able to operate until 8pm.“Eateries can stay open until 8pm but it needs to be stressed that these venues won’t be allowed to offer dining-in services or alcohol. Only takeaway services will be permitted,” said Ms Apisamai.“Venues reportedly prone to infection will need to close. These include massage and spa businesses and beauty centres,” she added.From Monday, both public and private sectors in Bangkok and nearby provinces are required to implement maximum work-from-home rules while public transport will see restricted services. Social gatherings will also be limited to five people in these areas.NEW VACCINATION PLAN FOR AT-RISK GROUPSThailand is facing the worst wave of COVID-19 infections, which has put an enormous strain on its healthcare system and medical personnel. The daily case numbers have been in the thousands for several weeks amid reports of the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.The country has recorded 288,643 cases and 2,440 casualties since a third wave of infections began in April, when a cluster was found at high-end nightclubs in Bangkok. On Friday, CCSA reported 9,276 new cases and 72 new deaths. Bangkok and nearby provinces alone accounted for 4,754 cases or 51 per cent of the new infections, excluding those in prisons.The national tally is now at 317,506, with 2,534 deaths. According to Ms Apisamai, the Public Health Ministry will adjust its vaccine distribution plan to better cover at-risk groups in Bangkok and surrounding areas, such as individuals above 60 years old and those with chronic diseases. “One million doses are expected to be administered within two weeks,” she said. More locations will also be set up to carry out COVID-19 tests and speed up disease detection in communities, she added.On Friday, CCSA reported 74,895 patients are receiving medical treatments for COVID-19 in medical facilities nationwide and 2,685 of them are in critical condition.DELTA VARIANT ON THE RISE IN THAILANDThailand is monitoring three coronavirus variants of concern, including Alpha, Beta and Delta. They were first documented in the United Kingdom, South Africa and India respectively.Based on data from the Public Health Ministry, the Delta variant is fast spreading in the country, especially in Bangkok, where it made up 52 per cent of new infections between Jun 28 and Jul 2. Although most domestic cases in the latest wave carry the Alpha variant, Thai health officials at the Medical Sciences Department found its transmission is in decline while that of the Delta strand increases every week.In a press briefing on Thursday, public health permanent secretary Kiattiphum Wongrajit said the infections are increasingly spreading from Bangkok and its vicinity to other parts of Thailand. Growing demand for COVID-19 tests as well as medical treatments in hospitals have also resulted in exhaustion among healthcare professionals, he added.“The Public Health Ministry is trying to come up with measures that would best control the disease,” Kiattiphum told reporters.Besides the partial lockdown, the ministry also proposed rapid antigen testing and home isolation. According to Mr Kiattiphum, COVID-19 tests in Thailand are usually carried out with the RT-PCR method, which requires longer evaluation time. Moreover, he added, potentially infected patients could spread the disease to others while waiting for the test result. “We’ve reached an agreement that we’ll use rapid antigen tests to support the disease examination. Initially, we’ve approved its use at registered medical facilities,” said Mr Kiattiphum, adding they would also be available for home use too.As the new wave of COVID-19 spreads across Thailand, a shortage of hospital beds has posed a great challenge for its public health system. Many infected patients have not been able to access medical treatments at hospitals and some of them lost their lives while waiting for hospital beds.The COVID-19 pandemic situation in Thailand has raised questions about the government’s plan to reopen the country to international travellers in October. The target was set by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, who said at least 50 million people in Thailand should already have received their first dose of a vaccine by early October. So far, about 8.8 million people have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 3.18 million have been fully vaccinated, according to the Disease Control Department.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Countries using Chinese, AstraZeneca Covid-19 shots increasingly eye boosters - The Straits Times
NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - Growing concern that Covid-19 vaccines being deployed across much of the developing world aren't capable of thwarting the Delta variant is prompting some countries to look at offering third doses to bolster immunity against more-infectious virus strains.Though definitive evidence is yet to emerge backing the need for so-called ""booster"" shots, health officials from Thailand to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have already decided to offer the extra doses to some people already inoculated with vaccines from Chinese makers Sinovac Biotech Ltd, Sinopharm and from AstraZeneca Plc.Officials are being motivated by concerns that Delta and other variants appear to be breaking down defences of vaccines not made from the super-effective messenger RNA technology, or mRNA.In places like Mongolia and the UAE, high levels of coverage with Chinese shots using the older, less effective inactivated vaccine platform hasn't stopped a surge in cases. In the Seychelles, five people Research shows that the Delta mutation is powerful enough to bringing down protection to below 90 per cent.The effectiveness of AstraZeneca's viral vector vaccine against symptomatic infections caused by the variant was lower at 60 per cent, a study showed, though it can still prevent more than 90 per cent of hospitalisations.Countries are hoping a booster - either mRNA or a dose of another shot previously taken - could bolster protection ahead of the return of colder weather that's optimal for the virus's spread.Unlike western developers, Sinovac and Sinopharm have shared little about how their vaccines could protect against variants.Dr Shao Yiming, a researcher with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in May that preliminary studies indicated Chinese vaccines were still protective against variants emerging from India, without elaborating.The two inactivated vaccines produced by Sinopharm were 73 per cent and 78 per cent effective against symptomatic Covid in phase III trials.Various results from Sinovac's clinical trials across Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey put efficacy at a wide range of 50 per cent to over 80 per cent, which has fuelled uncertainty about how well it works.""We recognise that the weaker vaccines in particular seem to lose their ability to protect against Covid-19 relatively quickly, particularly against the variant strains,"" said Professor Nikolai Petrovsky from the College of Medicine and Public Health at Australia's Flinders University. ""Even the better vaccines seem to be showing increasing levels of vaccine failure due to variant infections.""Yet any plans by wealthier nations to acquire additional shots stands to further strain global supply and exacerbate the inequality gap that has left poor countries with fewer inoculations.The  to help meet a goal of vaccinating at least 40 per cent % of every country's population by the end of the year. Global deaths passed 4 million this week, as the disparity leaves poorer places exposed to outbreaks.Giving extra doses ""could easily divert one to two billion doses of vaccines over the coming 12 months to boost people already immunised that might otherwise go to developing countries where people have yet to receive their first immunisation,"" Prof Petrovsky said.Pfizer Inc. CEO Albert Bourla tweeted Thursday that the company believes a booster dose ""will likely be necessary to maintain highest levels of protection"" against Covid, with initial data from its booster study demonstrating that the added dose was eliciting five-to-10 fold higher antibody response.The drugmaker plans to request US emergency authorisation in August for a third booster dose of its shot, based on early data showing it can increase immune protection from Covid.The WHO has expressed caution in encouraging third doses. Chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said in June that such a recommendation was unnecessary and premature given the paucity of data on booster shots and the fact that high-risk individuals in much of the world still haven't been fully vaccinated.But governments are racing ahead as the Delta variant spreads to more than 100 countries after devastating India, where it was first identified. The concern is particularly acute in places which had earlier relied on Chinese vaccines, which are available in nearly 100 nations.In the Middle East, some countries have already started offering booster shots - including Pfizer and Sinopharm - for people who completed their vaccinations months ago, mostly with Sinopharm.Thailand plans to use vaccines from AstraZeneca and Pfizer as boosters for healthcare workers who earlier received Sinovac shots. The Indonesian Doctors Association this week also called for booster shots for health workers, after some medical staffers died despite being fully inoculated with Sinovac and AstraZeneca.Preliminary studies from Thailand show that a first dose of Sinovac followed by an AstraZeneca shot three to four weeks later can elicit a stronger immune response than two doses of the Sinovac vaccine.Even China, which has fully immunised more than a third of its 1.4 billion people with homegrown vaccines, has a study underway to evaluate the benefit of booster shots.Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong has said a third shot of the company's vaccine, given three to six months after full inoculation, could raise antibody levels by as much as 20 times.China is currently reviewing the BioNTech vaccine for approval. A few options are being considered by officials, including using it a booster shot for people already fully inoculated with local vaccines, according to people familiar with the matter, asking not to be named as the talks are not public.No decision has been made, and adding the mRNA shot as another option in China's general rollout is also being discussed, the people said.""If you can explore different combinations, there frequently is a combination where you get a better outcome than just using the same vaccine twice in a row,"" said Prof Shane Crotty from the Centre for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at California's La Jolla Institute for Immunology.

KUALA LUMPUR - Umno chief Ahmad Zahid Hamidi insisted on Friday (July 9)  was not a power grab, but a move to address the government's mishandling of Malaysia's Covid-19 pandemic that has continued to set record highs despite a nationwide lockdown.The former deputy premier pointed out that total cases ""are nearing a million and the utilisation of ICU (intensive care unit) beds have nearly hit full capacity"". He said in a Facebook post: ""The result is a declining economy. Many have lost their source of income.""Yet, the pandemic continues to surge. More lives are lost. There is not even a hint it will ease. Does Umno not know of this? Umno understands all this. Umno knows the people cannot bear it anymore.

If that were so, it would be better to cling on to power now. Umno cannot be the 'pak sanggup' (enabler) for the PN government's failures,"" he added.Zahid's ally Najib Razak, the former premier who is appealing a graft conviction in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, also alleged on Friday ""the PN government's handling of Covid-19 has gotten worse with various mistakes being repeated even though it is obvious these huge errors will block an election... it is as if these mistakes were done on purpose"".But the Muhyiddin administration continued to operate as normal on Friday, despite continued uncertainty over its legitimacy.

PARIS (AFP) - Sinovac's Covid-19 vaccine, a key tool in Brazil's fight against Covid-19, is less effective against the Gamma variant first detected in the virus-ravaged South American country, a study said on Friday (July 9).Researchers found that antibodies generated by the vaccine, also known as CoronaVac, work less well against the variant than a previous coronavirus strain, while Gamma may also be able to reinfect people who had previously had the virus.Gamma's capacity to evade these immune system responses even in immunised people suggests ""the virus can potentially circulate in vaccinated individuals - even in areas with high vaccination rates,"" the study authors said in a press release.In the small study, researchers at the University of Campinas in Brazil exposed both Gamma and a previous strain of the virus to antibodies in blood plasma from 53 vaccinated people and 21 people who had been previously infected with the virus.In the vaccinated group, 18 people had received just one dose of CoronaVac - one of the main vaccines in Brazil's coronavirus response - while 20 had recently received a second jab and a further 15 had been vaccinated as part of the Sinovac clinical trial in August 2020.They found that Gamma was able to escape the antibodies of almost all the participants who had received only one dose, as well as those vaccinated in 2020.The antibodies from those more recently vaccinated were effective, but less so than against the previous virus strain.The study, published in The Lancet Microbe, also found that antibodies produced by previous infections had to be nine times higher to prevent infection by Gamma than to prevent illness from the previous strain.The authors said those results mean people who have already survived a case of Covid-19 could be reinfected.But they said since clinical trials suggest the vaccine is effective in preventing severe illness and death, it could be that the immune response is more complex.CoronaVac was approved by the World Health Organisation for emergency use in June.At the time the WHO said it had  and 100 per cent against hospitalisation.But results from CoronaVac phase 3 trials in Turkey - that did not take variants into account - published on Friday in the Lancet found two doses of the vaccine had an efficacy of 83.5 per cent in protecting against symptomatic infections.The study also found the vaccine was 100 per cent effective against hospitalisation.The study involved 6,559 participants who received the vaccine and 3,470 who were given a placebo.All were adults aged between 18 and 59 and were given doses 14 days apart.The authors said the limitations of the trials include that the participants were under 60 and low risk, calling for further research to test efficacy among older adults and those under 18, as well as against new variants.""The world needs every possible dose of any safe and effective vaccine against Sars-CoV-2,"" they said.Both papers are to be presented at this year's European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases.",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/articles/2021/07/09/nz_coronavac_090733.jpg?itok=EVoMgBG_&timestamp=1625784974,"Indonesia, Thailand consider booster shots amid doubts over Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine - The Straits Times
BANGKOK/JAKARTA (REUTERS) - Indonesia and Thailand are considering offering a booster shot to their medical workers immunised with Sinovac's Covid-19 vaccine, a move likely to reduce public trust in the Chinese product, which has been their main inoculation tool.Some countries including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have already started giving a booster shot to those inoculated with Chinese vaccines amid concerns that they may not be as effective against new and more transmissible coronavirus variants.But the challenges facing South-east Asia are much bigger.Many countries in the region rely heavily on Chinese vaccines due to tight supplies of Western products, and have low vaccination rates of less than 10 per cent.They are also battling a record-breaking surge in new cases and deaths, led by  while rising infections among medical workers despite them being fully immunised with the Sinovac shots have stretched already thin healthcare systems.""There are a lot of doctors and medical workers who have been vaccinated twice but endured medium and severe symptoms, or even died,"" Mr Slamet Budiarto, deputy chief of the Indonesian Medical Association, told Parliament on Monday (July 5).Indonesia has vaccinated millions of its healthcare workers with the Sinovac shot and ""It is the time for medical workers to get a third booster to protect them from the impact of more vicious and worrying new variants,"" said Mr Melki Laka Lena, deputy chairman of the parliamentary commission overseeing health.Ms Siti Nadia Tarmizi, an official from Indonesia's Health Ministry, said it is waiting for recommendations from an immunisation advisory group and Indonesia's Food and Drug Agency about the use of a booster shot.While some real world data showed that the Sinovac vaccine is effective against hospitalisation and severe Covid-19 cases, there is no detailed data yet on its effectiveness against the Delta variant, which was first identified in India.Thailand, which expects to receive a donation of 1.5 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots from the United States later this month, plans to use them in inoculating its 700,000 medical workers, most of whom have already received two shots of Sinovac.Senior health official Udom Kachintorn said the plan was aimed at increasing immunity, as the Delta variant increases caseloads and scores of medical workers who had been fully vaccinated with the Sinovac became infected.A leaked Thai Health Ministry document this week showed that the government was concerned about such a move sending the wrong signal to the public because it would be admitting that the Sinovac vaccine was not effective.""It will definitely have an impact on the trust in the vaccine,"" said Mr Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Australia's Griffith University.""The vaccine isn't necessarily ineffective, but its efficacy slides down after six months. That's my prediction,"" he said, recommending that the authorities consider a booster shot as a solution and communicate the problems with the public.The Thai authorities have defended the vaccine's use and their plan to purchase more of it.""Don't downgrade Sinovac even though we know efficacy is lower. It reduces the number of patients with critical condition, and fatalities,"" Mr Udom said.Indonesian doctors also acknowledged that Sinovac might not be the best vaccine on the market. But they said that for now, it is all they have and that is better than nothing.""Up to now, because we cannot produce (a vaccine), we have no (other) option,"" said Professor Eka Julianta Wahjoepramono, dean of the medical school at Pelita Harapan University in Indonesia.""Sinovac is the only choice,"" said Prof Eka, who was fully vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine but got a severe case of Covid-19 last month.Sinovac did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.Doubts about the effectiveness of Chinese vaccines threaten to undermine China's so-called ""vaccine diplomacy"", through which Beijing has sought to increase its diplomatic influence around the world. China has shipped hundreds of millions of doses of locally developed Covid-19 shots overseas.Singapore this week said people who received the Sinovac shots are due to a lack of efficacy data for the vaccine, especially against the contagious Delta variant.""We don't really have a medical or scientific basis or have the data now to establish how effective Sinovac is in terms of infection and severe illnesses on Delta,"" said the country's Health Minister Ong Ye Kung.China reiterated that its vaccines are safe and effective.""Chinese vaccines have earned a good reputation in the international community, with their safety and efficacy widely recognised,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Monday in response to a question on whether other countries have expressed concerns about Chinese vaccines.""To date, over 100 countries have approved Chinese vaccines...

After a failed attempt to inseminate her artificially, KB claimed MSB suggested they try to conceive naturally.She then said he secretly promised her that if the impregnation was a success, he would leave his wife and raise the baby with her as their own.According to court documents, the two met in 2014 and started their affair shortly after.Now years later, KB says she is being denied visitation rights… this after playing a “maternal” role to the child, breastfeeding her and changing her nappies.But MSB’s account of the events contradict that of his “mistress”. He admitted to the affair but disputes her claim that he promised to leave his wife and raise the baby with her.While noting the “unusual facts of this case”, Justice Milman said there was “no comparable precedent” directing his ruling on it.He is yet to rule who the child’s legal parents are.Related video:Share this article:",https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/320/File-photo-She-then-said-he-secretly-promised-her-that-if-the-impregnation-was-a-success-he-would-leave-his-wife-and-raise-the-baby-with-her-as-their-own-Pikist-com?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/3f9b0193-e83c-5b33-b59d-ddcb0cbe724c&operation=CROP&offset=0x153&resize=880x495

Don't miss a thing by getting the day's biggest stories sent direct to your inboxThree men who died after a horror head-on collision with a truck in Ireland were reportedly part of a burglary gang fleeing from police.. Named locally as Graham Taylor, 31, Carl Freeman, 26, and Dean Maguire, 29, they fled police officers minutes before the crash on Wednesday night, DublinLive reports.It is understood that the men were driving in a BMW Series 3 which was suspected to have been involved in some burglaries over the past few weeks. READ MORE:  Officers had seen the car driving erratically in the Cheeverstown area of Dublin as they engaged in a high-speed chase.The car drove onto the N7 and went on the wrong side of the road in an attempt to shake off police.By this point, gardai [Irish police] refrained from chasing them because of the danger the gang’s route posed.However, just a few minutes later around 11:40pm, the car drove headfirst into a truck near the Rathcoole exit of the N7.The driver of the truck, a man in his 40s, was taken to Tallaght University Hospital where he is being treated for his serious but non-life-threatening injuries.Taylor, Freemand and Maguire had over 200 convictions between them.It is not the first time the gang the three men were associated with have driven on the wrong side of the road in order to evade police, the Irish Mirror reports. A source told the Irish Mirror : “The men are well-known to gardai for carrying out a serious amount of burglaries on a consistent basis. “The move to drive away from gardai down the wrong side of the road is something that they have done before.“And on previous occasions, it has worked for the gang to get away.“But the sheer recklessness of it was shown in this incident. They’ve died as a result.“But there’s an innocent man who was just doing his job driving a lorry left with serious injuries. And there’s the whole trauma of such an incident that comes with it too.”The Garda Ombudsman have been notified that a high-speed chase took place before the crash and have announced they are conducting their own investigation.Footage of the chase posted on social media is understood to be part of both the garda probe and the investigation.Freeman was well-known to gardai and had over 60 convictions against him, including theft, burglary and assault.He once attacked an elderly couple in Wicklow, south of Dublin, in 2015 and was later convicted of aggravated burglary.Manchester's courts are some of the busiest in the country with a vast array of cases heard every week.In this case, he grabbed a 65-year-old woman, who was suffering from cancer, from her bed by the neck as he demanded cash- the woman's husband was also attacked with a hurley.Last night his partner posted a tribute on social media.She said: “I can’t believe I’m even writing this with the heaviest heart please just someone slap me this is all a nightmare there is no such thing as god“Look at u happy u we’re to good for this stupid shitty world I’ll see you on the other side.“You were so loved by everyone you have me lost I honestly can’t believe this my Karl I love you to peace please please please watch over me my love I’ll never forget you I promise I love you so so much.“My best friend and partner I can’t get my head around this.”Taylor, the oldest of the three dead men, had over 120 convictions which included burglary, criminal damage, an assault of a garda along with a long string of motoring offences.He had already been banned for driving for 40 years when he was involved in a chase with gardai in 2016.That day, he sped at more than 120kph in a 50kph zone during the incident and also drove at the wrong side of the road, forcing cars to hard brake and attempt to dodge the hood.Maguire, who has a rap sheet of over 25 convictions, is also a convicted burglar.Another source told the Irish Mirror: “Those lads did not have an ounce of respect for law enforcement or the law itself.“They were all relatively young but each built up a lot of convictions.“And despite being caught repeatedly, they would do their time and just come out and go back at it.”The hoods have actively worked with the major Tallaght-based gang - whose main members have close ties to slain mobster Fat Andy Connors - which has up to 80 associates operating with them.The gang actively burgle homes throughout the country, staying in areas for short stints and ransacking homes.They are so professional at what they do, they are often in and out of properties in less than five minutes.They also use stolen cars - often from the UK - and regularly change the reg plates before dumping the vehicle after a number of weeks.Last night, pals of the dead men also paid tribute to them on social media.One said: “RIP lads proper legends.”Another wrote that he’d never forget Taylor and Freeman, who he described as two “lunatics” and that it would be a different world without them.Another said: “Rest in paradise boys.”Mayor of South Dublin County Council Peter Kavanagh said the incident was news “no one wants to wake up to.”He added: “It’s obviously a terrible tragedy, it’s terrible for the families of those involved and my thoughts are with them at this moment.”Post mortems were to take place on the three men yesterday evening.Last night, the gardai appealed for information.A spokesman said: “Gardai are appealing for anyone with information to contact them. In particular, any witnesses who may have seen a dark blue BMW 3 Series vehicle (06-D-47768) in the areas of Belgard, Citywest or the N7 between 11.15pm – 12.00am are asked to come forward.“Gardai can be contacted at Clondalkin Garda station on 01 6667600 or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111.”GSOC also asked for anyone who can assist their investigations to contact them.They said: “The Commission asks any witnesses to the incidents or who have information or dash cam footage that will assist the investigations to contact GSOC at 1890 600 800 or info@gsoc.ie.”    ",https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article21010923.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_TRMRMMGLPICT000239065339o.jpg,"Police bodycam video shows kidnapped girl, 6, being rescued by officer in Kentucky - Sky News
Police bodycam footage shows officers rescuing a six-year-old girl after she was kidnapped from outside her home in Kentucky.The victim was riding her bicycle in Louisville on 2 July when she was snatched by a stranger in a car, witnesses told the Louisville Metro Police Department.Neighbour Prentiss Weatherford told WHAS-TV that he saw a car pull up in the middle of the street and grab the little girl ""by the collar"" before driving off with her.He claims to have chased the car and noted down a description and partial number plate, which he gave to police.They were then able to locate the vehicle and apprehend the suspect in 30 minutes.An officer's bodycam footage shows him pull up at a house and shout ""open the passenger door"" and ""put your hands in the air"" at the suspect, who was later identified as 40-year-old Robby Wildt.The officer opens the car door to find the young girl inside crying ""I want my daddy"".Mr Wildt is then seen kneeling on the ground with his hands above his head.He has since been charged with kidnapping a minor, to which he has pleaded not guilty.Lousville Metro Police Sergeant Joe Keeling said it is ""extremely rare for us to see a stranger kidnapping"".""She's a six-year-old girl that obviously couldn't help herself.

At least 50 people, mostly children, have died after a fire broke out at a food and drink factory in Bangladesh, according to local media reports.The fire service confirmed the blaze began on Thursday night at the five-storey Hashem Food and Beverage factory in Rupgani, 15 miles (24km) outside of the capital Dhaka.Local media reported that at least 50 bodies have been recovered from the factory, with some workers forced to jump from the upper floors.Another 30 people were injured and are being treated at a local hospital.Debasish Bardhan, deputy director of the Fire Service and Civil Defense, said 49 bodies have been recovered so far from inside the factory and rescue operations continued.The main exit gate of the factory, which processes juice, soft drinks and other food items, was locked from inside, he said.Ekattor TV said that most of the dead were children and the fire had not been completely extinguished 18 hours after it broke out.Meanwhile, relatives of workers were protesting outside the factory over the claims it was locked from the inside.The factory employs almost 7,000 workers and a large number are children, Ekattor said.Details on the cause of the blaze, how many people were inside the factory and how many are missing were not immediately available.This is the latest deadly blaze at a factory in Bangladesh.In November 2012, at least 117 people were confirmed dead after a garment factory fire on the outskirts of Dhaka.Another 200 people were injured in the blaze at the Tazreen Fashion factory, making it the deadliest factory fire in the nation's history.It led to a workers' protest, calling for better workplace safety, with about 200 factories closed during the demonstrations.Just 12 months later another fire at a garment factory killed seven people.The blaze at the Mirpur textile factory, whose clients included Gap, Next and H&M, was thought to have started by a faulty knitting machine.The textiles industry in Bangladesh, which accounts for a large chunk of its economy, has been heavily criticised in the past for its low pay, poor working conditions and low levels of health and safety.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/07/768x432/skynews-bangladesh-fire_5441897.jpg?20210709103435
