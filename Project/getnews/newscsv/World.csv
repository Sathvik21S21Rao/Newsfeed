"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga????????

A security official said Zubeidi briefly tried to escape during the arrest, but was quickly overpowered. Photos from the scene showed Zubeidi with what appeared to be a large bruise on his face, but it was not clear if this was sustained during the arrest.
A local resident later told reporters that the two appeared scared and hungry when they were caught.

Public Security Minister Omer Barlev vowed the remaining two fugitives would be caught and also thanked Arab Israelis “who assisted in the capture of the terrorists.”
“For four days the escapees wandered around believing they would find shelter and help among Arab Israelis, but they were mistaken,” Barlev tweeted. “Everywhere they turned, Arab citizens refused them and called police. Much respect to all the responsible citizens!”
Before the escape, Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was imprisoned while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

Mohammed al-Arida was arrested in 2002 on terror offenses and sentenced to life in prison while his brother Mahmoud al-Arida, considered a senior Islamic Jihad member, was jailed for life for terrorist activity, including attacks in which soldiers were killed.
Qadiri was also serving life terms for acts of terrorism including the murder of an Israeli in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud al-Arida were reportedly involved in a 2014 attempt to break out of Gilboa.
The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who like the other fugitives are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
Kamamji was serving a life sentence at the time of the escape for killing an 18-year-old Israeli in 2006, a murder he reportedly expressed pride in.
Nafayat has not been charged with a crime and was being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows it to imprison suspects without filing charges for security purposes.

For some Palestinians, the fugitives have been widely regarded as “heroes” who succeeded in freeing themselves from multiple life sentences.
Violent protests broke out at a number of locations in the West Bank after the announcement of the first arrests on Friday evening. The Hamas terror group said their detention would not “break their will.”
Shortly afterwards, a rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. There were no reports of injuries or damage. The Israel Defense Forces said it responded with airstrikes on a number of terror targets in the enclave.
Islamic Jihad also celebrated the escapees and warned Israel against any harm coming to them while in detention.
The six escaped from Gilboa Prison in the pre-dawn hours of Monday morning, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison.

Israeli forces have scrambled to find the inmates, all of them highly dangerous. In recent days, Israeli troops have arrested several of the fugitives’ family members, including five who were arrested in villages near the northern West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Friday morning, according to Palestinian media.
The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison and Barlev said Thursday that he had decided to form a government commission to probe the incident.
Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and a catalog of operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate. She imagined that Obamacare would cause health bureaucrats to ration out medical care, after first sitting in judgment of who was most deserving to receive it.This was awarded the “Lie of the Year” in 2009, as it was nowhere in any legislation. It was a right-wing fever dream.But now a version of it has come true — in Idaho. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the state has declared an emergency, called “crisis standards of care.” It means when you show up to the emergency room, you may get treated based preferentially on who is most likely to live.“If your mother has a heart attack, someone will have to assign her a point score designating how likely she is to survive,” the , describing the scheme last winter when it was first being contemplated. “If it isn’t high enough, she might not get an ICU bed, and a COVID patient will get it instead.“We will ask the nurses and doctors who’ve broken their backs trying to save us to make that Sophie’s choice over, and over, and over.”This past week the 200-bed hospital in Coeur d’Alene had 218 “med surge” patients — so many it was treating patients in hallways and running out of oxygen to help them breathe, .“What about the people who need emergency care but, because of the exploding COVID crisis here, can’t get it?” . “Do we just let them die?”The answer to that is: “Yes.” Letting them die is actually the plan. The GOP governor of Idaho said it was  But he made no moves to try anything else, such as requiring vaccinations for anyone (he earlier had  in the state). It’s a red state, and so for the most part they’re letting the virus rip and run.Remember years ago when a tea party debate audience cheered the idea of letting someone without insurance die? What’s happening in Idaho is even worse because it’s so preventable.Doctors in Idaho have said their COVID-19 patients are almost all unvaccinated. “We don’t have any vaccinated patients here,” an ICU doc in Boise told The Associated Press. “Misinformation is hurting people and killing people.”Idaho ranks last in the percentage of its population having at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, at only 45%. The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated. They’re raising the specter of rationing care there, too — something the chief medical officer said has never happened at the hospital.“I sure hope we don’t get there, but that’s where we’re heading,” he -Republic on Wednesday.When I wrote last week about a , asking whether society should care, I heard from a slew of readers furious because their own medical care is being delayed or cut off — a diffuse version of the triage going on in Idaho.“Am I angry? You bet I am,” wrote Mike Morrissey, of Snohomish, who says his cardiac surgery has been put off indefinitely due to a flood of COVID-19 patients. “My heart is failing without intervention. I can’t walk a block without stopping. But their choice [to not get vaccinated] just negated my urgent need.”Echoed a nurse at a regional hospital: “They’re dying of stupidity by choice, but at the same time taking up space in the hospital and displacing stroke, cancer and cardiac patients.”“Do I care what happens to those who won’t take a simple step to end this nightmare?” asked reader Jon Kraus, who said his brother-in-law had a surgery to fix a painful back condition put on hold due to COVID-19 levels. “I’m tired of catering to people who don’t care about anyone but themselves.”This is why Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden suddenly feel more comfortable . Yes, the right-wing flank of the GOP will sue, march around in tri-corner hats and scream at their local school boards. But people are done. The vaccinated — the majority in most states — have had enough.Now, as the workplace vax wars rev up, the best point to keep in mind is offered up by reader Michael Andreoni:“Who I DO feel sorry for are the medical personnel who have to deal with this mess,” he wrote.It’s the story of our time, how a pandemic that was visited upon us, through no fault of our own, ended up morphing into such a self-inflicted wound for America.It didn’t take a tyrant or a deep state or a committee of banal bureaucrats to bring death panels to life, as Sarah Palin imagined in her fever dream.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.

“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.What’s happeningOn Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga????????

Before the escape, Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was imprisoned while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate. She imagined that Obamacare would cause health bureaucrats to ration out medical care, after first sitting in judgment of who was most deserving to receive it.This was awarded the “Lie of the Year” in 2009, as it was nowhere in any legislation. It was a right-wing fever dream.But now a version of it has come true — in Idaho. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the state has declared an emergency, called “crisis standards of care.” It means when you show up to the emergency room, you may get treated based preferentially on who is most likely to live.“If your mother has a heart attack, someone will have to assign her a point score designating how likely she is to survive,” the , describing the scheme last winter when it was first being contemplated. “If it isn’t high enough, she might not get an ICU bed, and a COVID patient will get it instead.“We will ask the nurses and doctors who’ve broken their backs trying to save us to make that Sophie’s choice over, and over, and over.”This past week the 200-bed hospital in Coeur d’Alene had 218 “med surge” patients — so many it was treating patients in hallways and running out of oxygen to help them breathe, .“What about the people who need emergency care but, because of the exploding COVID crisis here, can’t get it?” . “Do we just let them die?”The answer to that is: “Yes.” Letting them die is actually the plan. The GOP governor of Idaho said it was  But he made no moves to try anything else, such as requiring vaccinations for anyone (he earlier had  in the state). It’s a red state, and so for the most part they’re letting the virus rip and run.Remember years ago when a tea party debate audience cheered the idea of letting someone without insurance die? What’s happening in Idaho is even worse because it’s so preventable.Doctors in Idaho have said their COVID-19 patients are almost all unvaccinated. “We don’t have any vaccinated patients here,” an ICU doc in Boise told The Associated Press. “Misinformation is hurting people and killing people.”Idaho ranks last in the percentage of its population having at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, at only 45%. The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated. They’re raising the specter of rationing care there, too — something the chief medical officer said has never happened at the hospital.“I sure hope we don’t get there, but that’s where we’re heading,” he -Republic on Wednesday.When I wrote last week about a , asking whether society should care, I heard from a slew of readers furious because their own medical care is being delayed or cut off — a diffuse version of the triage going on in Idaho.“Am I angry? You bet I am,” wrote Mike Morrissey, of Snohomish, who says his cardiac surgery has been put off indefinitely due to a flood of COVID-19 patients. “My heart is failing without intervention. I can’t walk a block without stopping. But their choice [to not get vaccinated] just negated my urgent need.”Echoed a nurse at a regional hospital: “They’re dying of stupidity by choice, but at the same time taking up space in the hospital and displacing stroke, cancer and cardiac patients.”“Do I care what happens to those who won’t take a simple step to end this nightmare?” asked reader Jon Kraus, who said his brother-in-law had a surgery to fix a painful back condition put on hold due to COVID-19 levels. “I’m tired of catering to people who don’t care about anyone but themselves.”This is why Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden suddenly feel more comfortable . Yes, the right-wing flank of the GOP will sue, march around in tri-corner hats and scream at their local school boards.

The vaccinated — the majority in most states — have had enough.Now, as the workplace vax wars rev up, the best point to keep in mind is offered up by reader Michael Andreoni:“Who I DO feel sorry for are the medical personnel who have to deal with this mess,” he wrote.It’s the story of our time, how a pandemic that was visited upon us, through no fault of our own, ended up morphing into such a self-inflicted wound for America.It didn’t take a tyrant or a deep state or a committee of banal bureaucrats to bring death panels to life, as Sarah Palin imagined in her fever dream.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.

“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.What’s happeningOn Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga????????

Before the escape, Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was imprisoned while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

Mohammed al-Arida was arrested in 2002 on terror offenses and sentenced to life in prison while his brother Mahmoud al-Arida, considered a senior Islamic Jihad member, was jailed for life for terrorist activity, including attacks in which soldiers were killed.
Qadiri was also serving life terms for acts of terrorism including the murder of an Israeli in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud al-Arida were reportedly involved in a 2014 attempt to break out of Gilboa.
The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who like the other fugitives are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
Kamamji was serving a life sentence at the time of the escape for killing an 18-year-old Israeli in 2006, a murder he reportedly expressed pride in.
Nafayat has not been charged with a crime and was being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows it to imprison suspects without filing charges for security purposes.

Israeli forces have scrambled to find the inmates, all of them highly dangerous. In recent days, Israeli troops have arrested several of the fugitives’ family members, including five who were arrested in villages near the northern West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Friday morning, according to Palestinian media.
The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison and Barlev said Thursday that he had decided to form a government commission to probe the incident.
Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and a catalog of operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate. She imagined that Obamacare would cause health bureaucrats to ration out medical care, after first sitting in judgment of who was most deserving to receive it.This was awarded the “Lie of the Year” in 2009, as it was nowhere in any legislation. It was a right-wing fever dream.But now a version of it has come true — in Idaho. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the state has declared an emergency, called “crisis standards of care.” It means when you show up to the emergency room, you may get treated based preferentially on who is most likely to live.“If your mother has a heart attack, someone will have to assign her a point score designating how likely she is to survive,” the , describing the scheme last winter when it was first being contemplated. “If it isn’t high enough, she might not get an ICU bed, and a COVID patient will get it instead.“We will ask the nurses and doctors who’ve broken their backs trying to save us to make that Sophie’s choice over, and over, and over.”This past week the 200-bed hospital in Coeur d’Alene had 218 “med surge” patients — so many it was treating patients in hallways and running out of oxygen to help them breathe, .“What about the people who need emergency care but, because of the exploding COVID crisis here, can’t get it?” . “Do we just let them die?”The answer to that is: “Yes.” Letting them die is actually the plan. The GOP governor of Idaho said it was  But he made no moves to try anything else, such as requiring vaccinations for anyone (he earlier had  in the state). It’s a red state, and so for the most part they’re letting the virus rip and run.Remember years ago when a tea party debate audience cheered the idea of letting someone without insurance die? What’s happening in Idaho is even worse because it’s so preventable.Doctors in Idaho have said their COVID-19 patients are almost all unvaccinated. “We don’t have any vaccinated patients here,” an ICU doc in Boise told The Associated Press. “Misinformation is hurting people and killing people.”Idaho ranks last in the percentage of its population having at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, at only 45%. The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated. They’re raising the specter of rationing care there, too — something the chief medical officer said has never happened at the hospital.“I sure hope we don’t get there, but that’s where we’re heading,” he -Republic on Wednesday.When I wrote last week about a , asking whether society should care, I heard from a slew of readers furious because their own medical care is being delayed or cut off — a diffuse version of the triage going on in Idaho.“Am I angry? You bet I am,” wrote Mike Morrissey, of Snohomish, who says his cardiac surgery has been put off indefinitely due to a flood of COVID-19 patients. “My heart is failing without intervention. I can’t walk a block without stopping. But their choice [to not get vaccinated] just negated my urgent need.”Echoed a nurse at a regional hospital: “They’re dying of stupidity by choice, but at the same time taking up space in the hospital and displacing stroke, cancer and cardiac patients.”“Do I care what happens to those who won’t take a simple step to end this nightmare?” asked reader Jon Kraus, who said his brother-in-law had a surgery to fix a painful back condition put on hold due to COVID-19 levels. “I’m tired of catering to people who don’t care about anyone but themselves.”This is why Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden suddenly feel more comfortable . Yes, the right-wing flank of the GOP will sue, march around in tri-corner hats and scream at their local school boards. But people are done. The vaccinated — the majority in most states — have had enough.Now, as the workplace vax wars rev up, the best point to keep in mind is offered up by reader Michael Andreoni:“Who I DO feel sorry for are the medical personnel who have to deal with this mess,” he wrote.It’s the story of our time, how a pandemic that was visited upon us, through no fault of our own, ended up morphing into such a self-inflicted wound for America.It didn’t take a tyrant or a deep state or a committee of banal bureaucrats to bring death panels to life, as Sarah Palin imagined in her fever dream.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.

“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.What’s happeningOn Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga???????? (@AviNoga3) September 11, 2021The trackers managed to follow the clues to Zubeidi and al-Arida, who were hiding in a parking lot used by truck drivers.
Al-Arida was found sleeping in a semi-trailer while Zubeidi was captured nearby as he wandered around exhausted.

A local resident later told reporters that the two appeared scared and hungry when they were caught.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate. She imagined that Obamacare would cause health bureaucrats to ration out medical care, after first sitting in judgment of who was most deserving to receive it.This was awarded the “Lie of the Year” in 2009, as it was nowhere in any legislation. It was a right-wing fever dream.But now a version of it has come true — in Idaho. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the state has declared an emergency, called “crisis standards of care.” It means when you show up to the emergency room, you may get treated based preferentially on who is most likely to live.“If your mother has a heart attack, someone will have to assign her a point score designating how likely she is to survive,” the , describing the scheme last winter when it was first being contemplated. “If it isn’t high enough, she might not get an ICU bed, and a COVID patient will get it instead.“We will ask the nurses and doctors who’ve broken their backs trying to save us to make that Sophie’s choice over, and over, and over.”This past week the 200-bed hospital in Coeur d’Alene had 218 “med surge” patients — so many it was treating patients in hallways and running out of oxygen to help them breathe, .“What about the people who need emergency care but, because of the exploding COVID crisis here, can’t get it?” . “Do we just let them die?”The answer to that is: “Yes.” Letting them die is actually the plan. The GOP governor of Idaho said it was  But he made no moves to try anything else, such as requiring vaccinations for anyone (he earlier had  in the state). It’s a red state, and so for the most part they’re letting the virus rip and run.Remember years ago when a tea party debate audience cheered the idea of letting someone without insurance die? What’s happening in Idaho is even worse because it’s so preventable.Doctors in Idaho have said their COVID-19 patients are almost all unvaccinated. “We don’t have any vaccinated patients here,” an ICU doc in Boise told The Associated Press. “Misinformation is hurting people and killing people.”Idaho ranks last in the percentage of its population having at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, at only 45%. The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated. They’re raising the specter of rationing care there, too — something the chief medical officer said has never happened at the hospital.“I sure hope we don’t get there, but that’s where we’re heading,” he -Republic on Wednesday.When I wrote last week about a , asking whether society should care, I heard from a slew of readers furious because their own medical care is being delayed or cut off — a diffuse version of the triage going on in Idaho.“Am I angry? You bet I am,” wrote Mike Morrissey, of Snohomish, who says his cardiac surgery has been put off indefinitely due to a flood of COVID-19 patients. “My heart is failing without intervention. I can’t walk a block without stopping. But their choice [to not get vaccinated] just negated my urgent need.”Echoed a nurse at a regional hospital: “They’re dying of stupidity by choice, but at the same time taking up space in the hospital and displacing stroke, cancer and cardiac patients.”“Do I care what happens to those who won’t take a simple step to end this nightmare?” asked reader Jon Kraus, who said his brother-in-law had a surgery to fix a painful back condition put on hold due to COVID-19 levels. “I’m tired of catering to people who don’t care about anyone but themselves.”This is why Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden suddenly feel more comfortable . Yes, the right-wing flank of the GOP will sue, march around in tri-corner hats and scream at their local school boards. But people are done. The vaccinated — the majority in most states — have had enough.Now, as the workplace vax wars rev up, the best point to keep in mind is offered up by reader Michael Andreoni:“Who I DO feel sorry for are the medical personnel who have to deal with this mess,” he wrote.It’s the story of our time, how a pandemic that was visited upon us, through no fault of our own, ended up morphing into such a self-inflicted wound for America.It didn’t take a tyrant or a deep state or a committee of banal bureaucrats to bring death panels to life, as Sarah Palin imagined in her fever dream.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.

“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.What’s happeningOn Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

 Members of National Resistance Front observe by a house near Panjshir Valley. ReutersNew Delhi, September 11Five days after all districts of Panjshir and the provincial centre were claimed to be captured by the Taliban, a commander of the Resistance Front in a recorded video message said the militant group's presence does not mean the end of the war.Saleh Rigistani, the commander, said they would continue fighting the Taliban forces.“I am sure the Mujahideen, the resistance forces and your sons will fight to death to defend your values and honour,” TOLO News quoted Rigistani as saying on Friday.""Right now, Panjshir is the centre of resistance and the resistance forces are present in all the mountains,"" said Abdul Latif Pedram, the leader of the National Congress Party.  Rigistani said the people in Panjshir were facing hunger and a lack of medicine.The Taliban, however, said some of the opposition fighters had fled to the mountains but talks were going on to convince them to return to normal life.Anaamullah Samangani, a member of the Taliban's Cultural Commission, said the Taliban forces had captured all parts of Panjshir and that the resistance forces are not there in any public way, the report said. ""They do not have a public presence; they are hidden in valleys and caves. Talks are going on with them, and we are trying to encourage them to come and lead peaceful and normal lives among their people,"" he said.Although reports indicate that both sides have agreed on a three-day unofficial ceasefire, neither side has confirmed the reports.A number of Panjshir residents said people are facing numerous problems as roads leading into the province are blocked and telecom services are not working.""People do not have food. Children need power and people are living scattered in different areas,"" Afsana Mohammadi, a Panjshir resident, was quoted as saying by TOLO News.""Telecom services are completely cut in Panjshir and the lack of electricity is another big problem,"" said Abdulwasi Almas, a local reporter from the province.After the capture of Panjshir, a Taliban spokesperson said Panjshir would have electricity and telecom services soon, and that roads would open.

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga????????

Al-Arida was found sleeping in a semi-trailer while Zubeidi was captured nearby as he wandered around exhausted.

Mohammed al-Arida was arrested in 2002 on terror offenses and sentenced to life in prison while his brother Mahmoud al-Arida, considered a senior Islamic Jihad member, was jailed for life for terrorist activity, including attacks in which soldiers were killed.
Qadiri was also serving life terms for acts of terrorism including the murder of an Israeli in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud al-Arida were reportedly involved in a 2014 attempt to break out of Gilboa.
The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who like the other fugitives are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
Kamamji was serving a life sentence at the time of the escape for killing an 18-year-old Israeli in 2006, a murder he reportedly expressed pride in.
Nafayat has not been charged with a crime and was being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows it to imprison suspects without filing charges for security purposes.

For some Palestinians, the fugitives have been widely regarded as “heroes” who succeeded in freeing themselves from multiple life sentences.
Violent protests broke out at a number of locations in the West Bank after the announcement of the first arrests on Friday evening. The Hamas terror group said their detention would not “break their will.”
Shortly afterwards, a rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. There were no reports of injuries or damage. The Israel Defense Forces said it responded with airstrikes on a number of terror targets in the enclave.
Islamic Jihad also celebrated the escapees and warned Israel against any harm coming to them while in detention.
The six escaped from Gilboa Prison in the pre-dawn hours of Monday morning, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison.

Israeli forces have scrambled to find the inmates, all of them highly dangerous. In recent days, Israeli troops have arrested several of the fugitives’ family members, including five who were arrested in villages near the northern West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Friday morning, according to Palestinian media.
The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison and Barlev said Thursday that he had decided to form a government commission to probe the incident.
Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and a catalog of operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate.

The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.

“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.What’s happeningOn Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga???????? (@AviNoga3) September 11, 2021The trackers managed to follow the clues to Zubeidi and al-Arida, who were hiding in a parking lot used by truck drivers.
Al-Arida was found sleeping in a semi-trailer while Zubeidi was captured nearby as he wandered around exhausted.

A security official said Zubeidi briefly tried to escape during the arrest, but was quickly overpowered. Photos from the scene showed Zubeidi with what appeared to be a large bruise on his face, but it was not clear if this was sustained during the arrest.
A local resident later told reporters that the two appeared scared and hungry when they were caught.

Public Security Minister Omer Barlev vowed the remaining two fugitives would be caught and also thanked Arab Israelis “who assisted in the capture of the terrorists.”
“For four days the escapees wandered around believing they would find shelter and help among Arab Israelis, but they were mistaken,” Barlev tweeted. “Everywhere they turned, Arab citizens refused them and called police. Much respect to all the responsible citizens!”
Before the escape, Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was imprisoned while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

Mohammed al-Arida was arrested in 2002 on terror offenses and sentenced to life in prison while his brother Mahmoud al-Arida, considered a senior Islamic Jihad member, was jailed for life for terrorist activity, including attacks in which soldiers were killed.
Qadiri was also serving life terms for acts of terrorism including the murder of an Israeli in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud al-Arida were reportedly involved in a 2014 attempt to break out of Gilboa.
The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who like the other fugitives are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
Kamamji was serving a life sentence at the time of the escape for killing an 18-year-old Israeli in 2006, a murder he reportedly expressed pride in.
Nafayat has not been charged with a crime and was being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows it to imprison suspects without filing charges for security purposes.

For some Palestinians, the fugitives have been widely regarded as “heroes” who succeeded in freeing themselves from multiple life sentences.
Violent protests broke out at a number of locations in the West Bank after the announcement of the first arrests on Friday evening. The Hamas terror group said their detention would not “break their will.”
Shortly afterwards, a rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. There were no reports of injuries or damage. The Israel Defense Forces said it responded with airstrikes on a number of terror targets in the enclave.
Islamic Jihad also celebrated the escapees and warned Israel against any harm coming to them while in detention.
The six escaped from Gilboa Prison in the pre-dawn hours of Monday morning, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison.

Israeli forces have scrambled to find the inmates, all of them highly dangerous. In recent days, Israeli troops have arrested several of the fugitives’ family members, including five who were arrested in villages near the northern West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Friday morning, according to Palestinian media.
The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison and Barlev said Thursday that he had decided to form a government commission to probe the incident.
Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and a catalog of operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.

“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.What’s happeningOn Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga???????? (@AviNoga3) September 11, 2021The trackers managed to follow the clues to Zubeidi and al-Arida, who were hiding in a parking lot used by truck drivers.
Al-Arida was found sleeping in a semi-trailer while Zubeidi was captured nearby as he wandered around exhausted.

A security official said Zubeidi briefly tried to escape during the arrest, but was quickly overpowered. Photos from the scene showed Zubeidi with what appeared to be a large bruise on his face, but it was not clear if this was sustained during the arrest.
A local resident later told reporters that the two appeared scared and hungry when they were caught.

Public Security Minister Omer Barlev vowed the remaining two fugitives would be caught and also thanked Arab Israelis “who assisted in the capture of the terrorists.”
“For four days the escapees wandered around believing they would find shelter and help among Arab Israelis, but they were mistaken,” Barlev tweeted. “Everywhere they turned, Arab citizens refused them and called police. Much respect to all the responsible citizens!”
Before the escape, Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was imprisoned while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

Mohammed al-Arida was arrested in 2002 on terror offenses and sentenced to life in prison while his brother Mahmoud al-Arida, considered a senior Islamic Jihad member, was jailed for life for terrorist activity, including attacks in which soldiers were killed.
Qadiri was also serving life terms for acts of terrorism including the murder of an Israeli in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud al-Arida were reportedly involved in a 2014 attempt to break out of Gilboa.
The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who like the other fugitives are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
Kamamji was serving a life sentence at the time of the escape for killing an 18-year-old Israeli in 2006, a murder he reportedly expressed pride in.
Nafayat has not been charged with a crime and was being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows it to imprison suspects without filing charges for security purposes.

For some Palestinians, the fugitives have been widely regarded as “heroes” who succeeded in freeing themselves from multiple life sentences.
Violent protests broke out at a number of locations in the West Bank after the announcement of the first arrests on Friday evening. The Hamas terror group said their detention would not “break their will.”
Shortly afterwards, a rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. There were no reports of injuries or damage. The Israel Defense Forces said it responded with airstrikes on a number of terror targets in the enclave.
Islamic Jihad also celebrated the escapees and warned Israel against any harm coming to them while in detention.
The six escaped from Gilboa Prison in the pre-dawn hours of Monday morning, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison.

Israeli forces have scrambled to find the inmates, all of them highly dangerous. In recent days, Israeli troops have arrested several of the fugitives’ family members, including five who were arrested in villages near the northern West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Friday morning, according to Palestinian media.
The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison and Barlev said Thursday that he had decided to form a government commission to probe the incident.
Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and a catalog of operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate. She imagined that Obamacare would cause health bureaucrats to ration out medical care, after first sitting in judgment of who was most deserving to receive it.This was awarded the “Lie of the Year” in 2009, as it was nowhere in any legislation. It was a right-wing fever dream.But now a version of it has come true — in Idaho. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the state has declared an emergency, called “crisis standards of care.” It means when you show up to the emergency room, you may get treated based preferentially on who is most likely to live.“If your mother has a heart attack, someone will have to assign her a point score designating how likely she is to survive,” the , describing the scheme last winter when it was first being contemplated. “If it isn’t high enough, she might not get an ICU bed, and a COVID patient will get it instead.“We will ask the nurses and doctors who’ve broken their backs trying to save us to make that Sophie’s choice over, and over, and over.”This past week the 200-bed hospital in Coeur d’Alene had 218 “med surge” patients — so many it was treating patients in hallways and running out of oxygen to help them breathe, .“What about the people who need emergency care but, because of the exploding COVID crisis here, can’t get it?” . “Do we just let them die?”The answer to that is: “Yes.” Letting them die is actually the plan. The GOP governor of Idaho said it was  But he made no moves to try anything else, such as requiring vaccinations for anyone (he earlier had  in the state). It’s a red state, and so for the most part they’re letting the virus rip and run.Remember years ago when a tea party debate audience cheered the idea of letting someone without insurance die? What’s happening in Idaho is even worse because it’s so preventable.Doctors in Idaho have said their COVID-19 patients are almost all unvaccinated. “We don’t have any vaccinated patients here,” an ICU doc in Boise told The Associated Press. “Misinformation is hurting people and killing people.”Idaho ranks last in the percentage of its population having at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, at only 45%. The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated. They’re raising the specter of rationing care there, too — something the chief medical officer said has never happened at the hospital.“I sure hope we don’t get there, but that’s where we’re heading,” he -Republic on Wednesday.When I wrote last week about a , asking whether society should care, I heard from a slew of readers furious because their own medical care is being delayed or cut off — a diffuse version of the triage going on in Idaho.“Am I angry? You bet I am,” wrote Mike Morrissey, of Snohomish, who says his cardiac surgery has been put off indefinitely due to a flood of COVID-19 patients. “My heart is failing without intervention. I can’t walk a block without stopping. But their choice [to not get vaccinated] just negated my urgent need.”Echoed a nurse at a regional hospital: “They’re dying of stupidity by choice, but at the same time taking up space in the hospital and displacing stroke, cancer and cardiac patients.”“Do I care what happens to those who won’t take a simple step to end this nightmare?” asked reader Jon Kraus, who said his brother-in-law had a surgery to fix a painful back condition put on hold due to COVID-19 levels. “I’m tired of catering to people who don’t care about anyone but themselves.”This is why Gov.

Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga???????? (@AviNoga3) September 11, 2021The trackers managed to follow the clues to Zubeidi and al-Arida, who were hiding in a parking lot used by truck drivers.
Al-Arida was found sleeping in a semi-trailer while Zubeidi was captured nearby as he wandered around exhausted.

A security official said Zubeidi briefly tried to escape during the arrest, but was quickly overpowered. Photos from the scene showed Zubeidi with what appeared to be a large bruise on his face, but it was not clear if this was sustained during the arrest.
A local resident later told reporters that the two appeared scared and hungry when they were caught.

Public Security Minister Omer Barlev vowed the remaining two fugitives would be caught and also thanked Arab Israelis “who assisted in the capture of the terrorists.”
“For four days the escapees wandered around believing they would find shelter and help among Arab Israelis, but they were mistaken,” Barlev tweeted. “Everywhere they turned, Arab citizens refused them and called police. Much respect to all the responsible citizens!”
Before the escape, Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was imprisoned while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

Mohammed al-Arida was arrested in 2002 on terror offenses and sentenced to life in prison while his brother Mahmoud al-Arida, considered a senior Islamic Jihad member, was jailed for life for terrorist activity, including attacks in which soldiers were killed.
Qadiri was also serving life terms for acts of terrorism including the murder of an Israeli in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud al-Arida were reportedly involved in a 2014 attempt to break out of Gilboa.
The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who like the other fugitives are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
Kamamji was serving a life sentence at the time of the escape for killing an 18-year-old Israeli in 2006, a murder he reportedly expressed pride in.
Nafayat has not been charged with a crime and was being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows it to imprison suspects without filing charges for security purposes.

For some Palestinians, the fugitives have been widely regarded as “heroes” who succeeded in freeing themselves from multiple life sentences.
Violent protests broke out at a number of locations in the West Bank after the announcement of the first arrests on Friday evening. The Hamas terror group said their detention would not “break their will.”
Shortly afterwards, a rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. There were no reports of injuries or damage. The Israel Defense Forces said it responded with airstrikes on a number of terror targets in the enclave.
Islamic Jihad also celebrated the escapees and warned Israel against any harm coming to them while in detention.
The six escaped from Gilboa Prison in the pre-dawn hours of Monday morning, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison.

Israeli forces have scrambled to find the inmates, all of them highly dangerous. In recent days, Israeli troops have arrested several of the fugitives’ family members, including five who were arrested in villages near the northern West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Friday morning, according to Palestinian media.
The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison and Barlev said Thursday that he had decided to form a government commission to probe the incident.
Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and a catalog of operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate. She imagined that Obamacare would cause health bureaucrats to ration out medical care, after first sitting in judgment of who was most deserving to receive it.This was awarded the “Lie of the Year” in 2009, as it was nowhere in any legislation. It was a right-wing fever dream.But now a version of it has come true — in Idaho. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the state has declared an emergency, called “crisis standards of care.” It means when you show up to the emergency room, you may get treated based preferentially on who is most likely to live.“If your mother has a heart attack, someone will have to assign her a point score designating how likely she is to survive,” the , describing the scheme last winter when it was first being contemplated. “If it isn’t high enough, she might not get an ICU bed, and a COVID patient will get it instead.“We will ask the nurses and doctors who’ve broken their backs trying to save us to make that Sophie’s choice over, and over, and over.”This past week the 200-bed hospital in Coeur d’Alene had 218 “med surge” patients — so many it was treating patients in hallways and running out of oxygen to help them breathe, .“What about the people who need emergency care but, because of the exploding COVID crisis here, can’t get it?” . “Do we just let them die?”The answer to that is: “Yes.” Letting them die is actually the plan. The GOP governor of Idaho said it was  But he made no moves to try anything else, such as requiring vaccinations for anyone (he earlier had  in the state). It’s a red state, and so for the most part they’re letting the virus rip and run.Remember years ago when a tea party debate audience cheered the idea of letting someone without insurance die? What’s happening in Idaho is even worse because it’s so preventable.Doctors in Idaho have said their COVID-19 patients are almost all unvaccinated. “We don’t have any vaccinated patients here,” an ICU doc in Boise told The Associated Press. “Misinformation is hurting people and killing people.”Idaho ranks last in the percentage of its population having at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, at only 45%. The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated. They’re raising the specter of rationing care there, too — something the chief medical officer said has never happened at the hospital.“I sure hope we don’t get there, but that’s where we’re heading,” he -Republic on Wednesday.When I wrote last week about a , asking whether society should care, I heard from a slew of readers furious because their own medical care is being delayed or cut off — a diffuse version of the triage going on in Idaho.“Am I angry? You bet I am,” wrote Mike Morrissey, of Snohomish, who says his cardiac surgery has been put off indefinitely due to a flood of COVID-19 patients. “My heart is failing without intervention. I can’t walk a block without stopping. But their choice [to not get vaccinated] just negated my urgent need.”Echoed a nurse at a regional hospital: “They’re dying of stupidity by choice, but at the same time taking up space in the hospital and displacing stroke, cancer and cardiac patients.”“Do I care what happens to those who won’t take a simple step to end this nightmare?” asked reader Jon Kraus, who said his brother-in-law had a surgery to fix a painful back condition put on hold due to COVID-19 levels. “I’m tired of catering to people who don’t care about anyone but themselves.”This is why Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden suddenly feel more comfortable . Yes, the right-wing flank of the GOP will sue, march around in tri-corner hats and scream at their local school boards. But people are done. The vaccinated — the majority in most states — have had enough.Now, as the workplace vax wars rev up, the best point to keep in mind is offered up by reader Michael Andreoni:“Who I DO feel sorry for are the medical personnel who have to deal with this mess,” he wrote.It’s the story of our time, how a pandemic that was visited upon us, through no fault of our own, ended up morphing into such a self-inflicted wound for America.It didn’t take a tyrant or a deep state or a committee of banal bureaucrats to bring death panels to life, as Sarah Palin imagined in her fever dream.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.

“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.What’s happeningOn Sept. 16, 2001, then-President George W. Bush responded to a reporter’s question about his administration’s response to the attacks on the World Trade Center, saying, “This is a new kind of — a new kind of evil. … This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.”That apparently unscripted statement, shortened by Bush to “war on terror” in a speech a few days later, would quickly be codified into a formal policy that has dramatically changed the United States’ role in the world over the past 20 years. The U.S. military’s counterterrorism mission began in Afghanistan with an invasion aimed at eliminating those behind the 9/11 attacks and the Taliban government that harbored them, but it quickly became motivation for a sprawling global campaign. Specious claims of a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida were part of the Bush administration’s rationale for the Iraq War. War powers granted to the executive branch by Congress shortly after Sept. 11 have also been used to carry out  in at least a dozen countries in the intervening years.The professed urgency of the threat of attacks was at the heart of some of the most controversial policies over the past two decades, including the use of torture, the extrajudicial detention of suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay, drone strikes and a major expansion of the government’s ability to conduct surveillance on Americans.Why there’s debateThe end of the war in Afghanistan and the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks have led to widespread reflection on the impact of U.S. counterterrorism operations on Americans and the world.In the eyes of many critics, the “war on terror” has been a failure. They argue that any honest assessment of a global terrorist threat shows that American intervention has not only failed to eliminate extremist groups, but has often created instability that has allowed them to flourish. Any victories, they add, must be weighed against the extraordinary costs linked to the U.S. counterterrorism campaign, which include an estimated 900,000 deaths, 38 million people displaced from their homes and a price tag of $8 trillion.Others argue that these critiques ignore the successes of the past two decades, chief among them the fact that there has not been another major terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11. They say that, while extremist groups still exist, the U.S. has become much more capable of defending itself and its allies thanks to the investments it has made over the past 20 years.Many cultural critics argue that “war on terror” infused a sense of fear and anger into American life that has fueled some of the most harmful trends of our era, including racism, polarization, extremism and the rollback of civil liberties.What’s nextThe phrase “war on terror” has been mostly abandoned by federal government officials since the Obama administration, but American counterterrorism efforts are ongoing. One of the key foreign policy questions facing the Biden administration is whether the U.S. can use diplomatic leverage and “over-the-horizon” strike capabilities to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for terrorist groups now that the war is over.The U.S. won the ‘war on terror’“​​To date, what George W. Bush called the global war on terror has succeeded remarkably, if provisionally, in its single most important goal from an American national security perspective: protecting the homeland, and Americans therein, from attack. This accomplishment has become internalized in our consciousness, almost mundane in our thoughts. But it is remarkable.” — Michael O’Hanlon and Lily Windholz, National InterestThe ‘war on terror’ was a victory for extremists“In orchestrating the attacks on September 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden had wanted to end the global reign of the decadent West, inflict a staggering blow to American democracy, and entangle every Muslim in the conflict. Bin Laden may be dead, but it is hard not to conclude that he got what he wanted.” — Omer Aziz, New YorkThe fight against terror is still worth waging“In Afghanistan and beyond, the war on terror is far from over. All nations who believe in freedom, safety and democracy will have to reengage. There can be no withdrawal from that.” — Editorial, Chicago TribuneThe ‘war on terror’ has done little to stop extremism from spreading“The main lesson from the Afghan experience is that the ‘war on terror’ does not work. Twenty years after the invasion, extremist Islamists are celebrating their victory. It is true, as Biden said, that the US conducts counter-terror operations in multiple places; the consequence has been the spread of extremist Islamism not just in Afghanistan and the Middle East but in large parts of Africa.” — Mary Kaldor, GuardianThe U.S. has become much more effective at stopping future attacks“We thus face more overseas peril than we have at any time in the last 20 years. But our counter-terrorism defenses, especially homeland security, are night-and-day better than they were on 9/11.” — Andrew C. McCarthy, National ReviewAnti-Muslim bigotry is the lasting legacy of the ‘war on terror’“Six wars, millions killed, trillions wasted, and a plague of suffering and trauma inflicted on the Muslim world, accelerating a tidal wave of refugees that has created panic in the European Union and resulted in a huge increase of votes for far-right parties—which in turn has pushed an already extreme political center further to the right. Islamophobia, promoted by politicians of every stripe in the West, is now embedded in Western culture.” — Tariq Ali, The NationThe U.S. squandered an opportunity to create a better world“What if instead of launching a War on Terror, the greatest strategic disaster in the United States’ modern history, U.S. leaders had used 9/11 as a catalyst to bring about a more tolerant, peaceful and prosperous world, the antithesis of al-Qaeda’s worldview? This was neither a far-fetched scenario nor it is wishful thinking.” — Fawaz A. Gerges, Washington PostThe Afghanistan and Iraq wars shouldn’t define the broader ‘war on terror’“Bush’s vision of democratization by force was at best highly ambitious, and in some ways fundamentally misguided. The War on Terror, however, is neither misguided, nor has it been unsuccessful.” — Nicholas Grossman, AtlanticThe focus on terrorism cost us the chance to address an truly existential threat“Plotting out the connections between this open-ended war and the climate crisis is a grim exercise, but an important one. It's critical to examine how the War on Terror not only took up all of the oxygen when we should have been engaged in all-out effort to curb emissions, but also made the climate crisis far worse, by foreclosing on other potential frameworks under which the United States could relate with the rest of the world.” — Sarah Lazare, Common DreamsThe ‘war on terror’ allowed far-right extremism to flourish at home.“In the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the rise of violent jihadism reshaped American politics in ways that created fertile ground for right-wing extremism. … But it wasn’t just the terrorists who gave right-wing extremists a boost: so, too, did the U.S.-led war on terrorism, which involved the near-complete pivoting of intelligence, security, and law enforcement attention to the Islamist threat, leaving far-right extremism to grow unfettered.” — Cynthia Miller-Idriss, Foreign AffairsThe defining element of the ‘war on terror’ is the abandonment of American values“The entire war on terror … ended up being a war on America’s values. CIA ‘black sites’ and ‘renditions’ of ‘enemy combatants’ skirted or violated international law. The use of waterboarding and other torture methods — under the euphemism ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’ — cost America the moral high ground.” — Editorial, Los Angeles TimesIs there a topic you’d like to see covered in “The 360”?

"Taliban firmly in charge as Afghans mark muted 9/11 - CNA
KABUL: Afghanistan marked the 20th anniversary of 9/11 in muted fashion Saturday (Sep 11) with the Taliban firmly in charge, two decades after being ousted for hosting the architects of the US attacks.The hardline militants retook power on Aug 15, after a lightning offensive that capitalised on the chaotic last weeks of the 20-year US-led occupation that followed the 2001 attacks.In a sign that things were returning to normal, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) said it would resume flights to Kabul from Monday, the first foreign commercial service since the Taliban seized power last month.And in a carefully orchestrated publicity stunt, hundreds of fully veiled women staged a rally at a Kabul university to profess support for the Taliban, just days after public protests against their rule were banned.Unconfirmed reports had circulated all week that the Taliban may use the Sep 11 anniversary to swear in their new government, but the day unfolded without formal recognition.""This is a day for America, not for Afghanistan,"" said Muhammad Alzoad, a bank clerk.""This was nothing to do with Afghanistan, but it made us suffer.""The attacks against the United States were planned by Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, who had taken refuge in Afghanistan after the Taliban took power in 1996.When the Taliban refused to hand him over, the US led a massive invasion and installed a new government that became utterly dependent on Western aid and support for survival.The Taliban have promised a milder form of rule this time, but have moved swiftly to crush dissent - firing in the air to disperse protests by women last week calling for the right to education and work.Taliban fighters have violently put down protests that broke out against their rule in Kabul and elsewhere in recent days, shooting two people dead.They also detained and brutally beat some journalists who covered the protests, before outlawing demonstrations unless permitted by the justice department.On Saturday, however, dozens of women dressed head-to-toe in black abayas and face-covering niqabs were allowed to rally in support of the Taliban.Around 300 similarly dressed women first met at a lecture hall of a Kabul university to hear speakers extol the virtues of Taliban policies.Women were largely excluded from public life - including work and education - under the Taliban's 1996-2001 regime.This time, the Taliban have said women will be allowed to attend university as long as classes are segregated by sex or at least divided by a curtain.""Those not wearing the hijab are harming all of us,"" said one female speaker Saturday, referring to the headscarves worn by many Muslim women.""We are supporting our government with all our strength,"" said another.After the speeches, the women held banners and walked in organised lines for a short distance on the street outside, flanked by Taliban soldiers carrying rifles and machine guns.Also on Saturday, PIA said it was resuming flights to and from Kabul, but added the schedule would depend on demand.""We have got all technical clearances for flight operations,"" PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan told AFP.""Our first commercial plane ... is scheduled to fly from Islamabad to Kabul on Sep 13. We will make the decision about the regular commercial operations in due course after assessing the situation.""Kabul airport was severely damaged during the evacuation of over 120,000 people, which ended with the withdrawal of US forces on August 30.The Taliban have been scrambling to get it operating again with Qatari technical assistance.In the last two days, Qatar Airways has operated two charter flights out of Kabul, carrying mostly foreigners and Afghans who missed being taken out during the evacuation.Two planes from the United Arab Emirates landed on Saturday carrying aid supplies including meat, powdered milk, cooking oil and other items - part of what an official described as a ""humanitarian airbridge"".An operations manager with the UAE-based GAAC - a company that has provided ground and security services for the airport since November 2020 - told AFP that efforts to make the facility fully functional were under way.""We have activated and resumed our operations,"" said Ibrahim Moarafi.We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

SINGAPORE - In the months following the 9/11 terror attacks and the discovery of regional terror network Jemaah Islamiah (JI) and its plots against multiple targets here, the greater danger to multiracial, multi-religious Singapore was not to physical safety, but to mutual trust and cohesion, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.In the face of extreme Islamist terrorism, and  non-Muslims could easily have become fearful and suspicious of their Muslim neighbours, colleagues and friends, he said.And Muslims in turn, feeling distrusted and threatened, could have closed in on themselves.""We would have been divided by race and religion. And if an attack had actually taken place here, our society could have been torn apart,"" he added in a commentary on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 published on Saturday (Sept 11).Singapore  and with the Government, overcoming sensitive issues together in an even-handed way for the collective good, he said.""In an existential crisis, Singaporeans instinctively pulled together, and responded strongly and cohesively to keep ourselves safe,"" added the Prime Minister.Exactly 20 years ago on Sept 11, 2001, militants from terror group Al-Qaeda hijacked commercial planes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000.PM Lee, who was then Acting Prime Minister in Mr Goh Chok Tong's absence, said that the dangers to Singapore had appeared far sooner and nearer than imagined, as the JI terror group, which had a common ideology and direct links with Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, was discovered by the authorities.On 9/11, JI members were already in advanced planning for simultaneous truck bomb attacks on multiple targets in Singapore, including the US Embassy and other Western interests. ""Fortunately, the Internal Security Department acted swiftly to disrupt the group, in time to prevent a disaster,"" PM Lee wrote.Singaporeans pulled together, with community and religious leaders standing in solidarity and coming out to condemn the attacks.""In particular, Muslim leaders were forthright in repudiating the terrorists, and they guided the community on the true teachings of Islam. Non-Muslim leaders too spoke up in support of religious tolerance and to express confidence in their fellow Singaporeans,"" he added.PM Lee cited efforts by the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles to build trust and the Religious Rehabilitation Group to counsel those led astray by violent extremist ideology. Several Muslim groups came together to help support the families affected, and in most cases, the efforts succeeded.""Because we did all this, our racial and religious harmony held, and indeed strengthened.""The fight against terrorism is far from over, he added. Extremist terrorism has metastasised and digital media amplified the poison.Al-Qaeda was succeeded by ISIS, which has lost physical territory but continues to operate, including online. Lone-wolf attackers have self-radicalised on the Internet.""And now that the US has left Afghanistan, we will have to watch closely how the situation there develops, whether groups based in Afghanistan will again threaten our security, and where else new fronts of terrorism may emerge,"" he said.Racial harmony in Singapore is still a work in progress, he added. ""9/11 showed how powerful are the forces that can pull us apart, and how careful we must be when making any changes to the formula that has delivered racial and religious harmony for Singapore.""PM Lee cautioned against the assumption that the tendency of people to identify with their own racial and religious groups has been overcome. ""We have to keep on bringing all the communities closer together, and from time to time adjust the delicate balance that the different communities have reached.""Describing Singaporeans' shared experience of 9/11 as a formative chapter in nation building, he said: ""Let us resolve to fortify ourselves so that should we ever face another such test one day, we will come through again, stronger, as one united people.""Help us make this ""Follow writer"" feature better.This questionnaire should take no more than a minute to complete.

hen Leylah Fernandez was 11 years old, she put in her latest slip to be excused from class to compete in yet another tennis tournament.The message from her teacher was blunt, that she should turn her back on a sport where she would never make it and instead focus on her studies.Wind the clock forward eight years and the Canadian – daughter of an Ecuadorian father and mother of Filipino descent – finds herself in the final of a Grand Slam.The words of discouragement from her form teacher, she said, had long acted as a motivating factor in setting up a meeting with Emma Raducanu tomorrow night – the first all-teen Grand Slam final since Serena Williams and Martina Hingis battled it out at the same event in New York in 1999.“A lot of people doubted me, my family and my dreams,” said Fernandez after beating No2 seed Aryna Sabalenka. “They kept saying no, that I’m not going to be a professional tennis player, that I should stop and just pursue going to school.“I remember one teacher, which was actually very funny – at the time it wasn’t but now I’m laughing. She told me to stop playing tennis, you will never make it, and just focus on school.“You know what, I’m just glad that she told me that because every day I have that phrase in my head saying that I’m going to keep going, I’m going to push through and I’m going to prove to her everything that I’ve dreamed of I’m going to achieve them.”To highlight quite how far the two finalists have come is to go back to their last meeting at junior Wimbledon in 2018.The Montreal-born Fernadez enjoyed a promising career as a junior and had climbed up the ranking to 73rd in the world prior to the US Open with a previous best Grand Slam appearance of the third round at the French Open.Coached by both her father and Romain Deridder in Florida, her run to the finals has only been marginally more surprising than that of Raducanu.And she is not the sole tennis prodigy in her family, 17-year-old sister Bianca Jolie already showing promise in the junior ranks.Asked for the secret to Canadian success in the men’s and women’s draw at Flushing Meadows in one preceding round, she told the crowd it was “maple syrup”. And like with Raducanu, the public in the Big Apple have been as in rapture to her play as those smiling post-match interviews.While Raducanu has had a penchant for post-match frozen yoghurt, Fernandez’s has been for cupcakes.Of her potential in tomorrow’s final and beyond, Fernandez said: “It has helped me open my eyes that I have no limit to my potential, that I can go three sets against these players and I can win against these players.”",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Taliban victory in Afghanistan may spur militants in S-E Asia - The Straits Times
Shortly after the Taliban captured Kabul, an offshoot of South-east Asia's most notorious terror network Jemaah Islamiah (JI) congratulated the Afghan group for its ""victory in freeing Afghan soil from the clutches of the American coloniser and puppet government"".The Aug 17 statement by Jamaah Ansharusy Syariah (JAS) was signed by the group's spokesman Abdul Rochim, who is the son of convicted radical cleric and JI's former spiritual leader Abu Bakar Bashir.""We urge Muslims from all over the world, especially Indonesian Muslims, to celebrate this victory for Islam,"" the statement said.JI, an affiliate of Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda, was behind some of the deadliest attacks in Indonesia, including the 2000 Christmas Eve bombings against churches and priests and  mostly Westerners.Sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2011 for funding a militant camp and freed in January, Bashir also founded other extremist groups in Indonesia such as Majelis Mujahidin Indonesia and JI's splinter cell, Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT).But JAT has split into JAS and Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) after Bashir pledged allegiance in 2014 to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the slain leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). said a top official.Whichever group or its affiliation, law enforcers will stay alert against potential threats, including a possible resurgence of attacks following the Taliban's success, said Brigadier-General Eddy Hartono, a spokesman for the National Counter Terrorism Agency.""We should be careful with the euphoria surrounding the Taliban's victory... The worry is it could inspire supporters in this region,"" he told The Straits Times.He noted that JAS, which has not committed any violence so far, has put out a statement in support of the Taliban, Al-Qaeda's long-time ally.""Terrorism is born out of intolerance, which is dangerous,"" said Brig-Gen Eddy, a sentiment widely shared by leaders and officials around South-east Asia.Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told the Philippine News Agency on Aug 27: ""Taliban or no Taliban, we have always considered local extremism as a big concern. Afghanistan is not the only country that could provide encouragement or inspiration to local terrorists.""He noted that the Philippines had agreements with Indonesia and Malaysia on protecting its southern borders and sharing information on the movement of terrorists.Security analysts have warned that events in Afghanistan could encourage militant Muslims elsewhere to take up arms to topple their own governments.""Some of them have expressed their desire to go to Afghanistan to learn military strategies from the Taliban. When they return to Indonesia, they want to use the military expertise they have acquired in Afghanistan to overthrow the legitimate Indonesian government,"" senior researcher Muh Taufiqurrohman from Jakarta-based think-tank, Centre for Radicalism and Deradicalisation Studies, told The Straits Times.Such statements cannot be taken lightly, he said.After all, militants from terror groups from around the region, including JI, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines, and Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia went to military camps in Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s.There, they trained with guerilla fighters known as the mujahideen, learnt bomb making and infantry tactics, and established international connections.Some of the militants mounted attacks when they returned home, and were a potent security threat to their governments and people.The deaths of key figures and arrests by anti-terror police have weakened JI, but the organisation continues to exist.

Last month, Indonesian police arrested 53 militants, mostly from JI, suspected of planning attacks on Independence Day on Aug 17. Weapons, ammunition and donation boxes used to raise funds were seized.In recent years, pro-ISIS groups have gained prominence and many, like JI, sent their members to train and fight overseas, namely in Syria and Iraq, particularly when ISIS held sway over large parts of Syria.ISIS lost the last vestige of territory in 2019, but there is little doubt the group remains active, clearly evident when it claimed responsibility for an Aug 30 rocket attack on the airport in Kabul.Analysts are convinced that, in the short term, pro-ISIS groups would likely pose the bigger threat.Mr Taufik Andrie, a terrorism expert from the Peace Inscription Foundation, said: ""In terms of small-scale attacks, ISIS will be more dominant than JI. The pro-ISIS groups like JAD may not be too structured, but they are more spontaneous and quick in building strength such as in logistics.""He added that these attacks, however, are more easily managed by well-trained anti-terror units.JI, for now, has not shown interest or has the capacity, including trained militants, to commit terror acts, said Mr Taufik.However he does not rule out physical attacks in the future, saying: ""JI is in a period of idad (preparations), and when it is ready, which we don't know when, it could create momentum to strike.""More ominous, though, is that JI appears to have shifted its focus from armed militancy to becoming a more open organisation involved in religious outreach and democratic activities, such as participating in elections and lobbying the government and Parliament.Dr Noor Huda Ismail, a visiting fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said JI has begun to exert its influence in ""subtle and incremental"" ways.""JI provides services that the government cannot provide yet. If school fees are expensive, they say, 'Why don't you come to my school?', or if you are a hopeless romantic, they may say, 'I can find a spouse for you'.""In politics, they could make a push for policies which support their ideology such as imposing syariah law.""Balinese Nyoman Gede Suma Artha is among those who hope the events in Afghanistan will not come to haunt them again. The 52-year-old social entrepreneur was only 50m away from where the blasts occurred in Bali in 2002.He said: ""I heard blasts which sounded like a gas container exploding. The situation was chaotic, dead bodies lying around, people were panicking and looking for their lost relatives. I hope terror attacks will never happen again.""The 9/11 attacks launched on the United States by Al-Qaeda terrorists were the deadliest in history.

Members of the New York Police and Fire Department hold a flag for the national anthem during the annual 9/11 Commemoration Ceremony in New York City. (Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images/AFP)NEW YORK: America marked the 20th anniversary of 9/11 on Saturday (Sep 11) with solemn ceremonies given added poignancy by the recent chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and return to power of the Taliban.At the 9/11 memorial in New York, relatives wiped away tears, their voices breaking as they read out the names of the almost 3,000 people killed in the Al-Qaeda attacks.""We love you and we miss you,"" many of them said as sombre violin music played at the official ceremony, attended by dignitaries including President Joe Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.At the Ground Zero site where 2,753 people died - some of whom jumped to their deaths from the collapsing towers - the service started shortly after 8.30am under tight security, with Lower Manhattan effectively locked down.The first of six moments of silence were marked at 8:46 am, with a bell ringing to symbolise the time the first hijacked plane crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.At 9.03am, attendees stood still again to mark the moment the South Tower was struck. At 9.37am, it was the Pentagon, where the hijacked airliner killed 184 people in the plane and on the ground.At 9.59am, the moment the South Tower fell. At 10.03am, they remembered the fourth plane to crash in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers fought the hijackers. At 10.28am, the North Tower falling.Mourners clutched photos of their loved ones, their pain still raw despite a whole generation having grown up since the morning of Sep 11.""As we carry these 20 years forward, I find continuing appreciation for all of those who rose to be more than ordinary people,"" said Mike Low, whose daughter was a flight attendant on the first plane.Bruce Springsteen sang his song ""I'll See You in My Dreams,"" and after nightfall twin light beams will be projected into the New York sky.Smaller ceremonies took place across the country, including outside fire stations throughout New York in remembrance of the 343 firefighters who lost their lives to save others, while a brief moment of contemplation took place in Times Square.Heart-wrenching commemorations also took place at the Pentagon and Shanksville.In the last 20 years, Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden has been hunted down and killed and towering new skyscraper has risen over Manhattan, replacing the Twin Towers, dubbed the ""Freedom Tower.""But 9/11 is never far away.In Guantanamo Bay, accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men continue to await trial, nine years after charges were filed.And even the full story of how the attack came to happen remains secret. Only last week did Biden order the release of classified documents from the FBI investigation over the next six months.The memorials come with US troops finally gone from Afghanistan, but national discord over the exit has overshadowed what was supposed to be a pivotal day in Biden's nearly eight-month-old presidency.Less than two weeks ago, the last US soldiers flew from Kabul airport, ending the so-called ""forever war.""But the Taliban who once sheltered Osama bin Laden are back ruling Afghanistan.
 In a video posted on the eve of the anniversary, Biden urged Americans to show unity, ""our greatest strength.""""To me, that's the central lesson of September 11th. It's that at our most vulnerable, in the push and pull of all that makes us human, in the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength,"" Biden said in a six-minute message from the White House.But former president Donald Trump shattered that unity, releasing a video message slamming the ""inept administration"" of Biden for its ""incompetence"" over the Afghan withdrawal.World leaders struck a more cordial tone, sending messages of solidarity to the United States, and saying that the attackers had failed to destroy Western values.We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

"Pandor explains why SA refused to temporarily receive Afghan refugees - Eyewitness News
JOHANNESBURG - International Relations Minister Naledi Pandor on Friday said the evacuation of US Army from Afghanistan as the Taliban took over was ""exceptionally badly handled"". Pandor said the management of the process was concerning, which placed the country's security at risk.""I believe that the process wasn't handled very well. I think there should have been a far smoother process of particularly the evacuation of persons as the United States had promised they would evacuate from that country. So I think the management was rather of concern.She found the collapse of the Afghanistan government very surprising. ""The army couldn't hold out, so security was not able to be provided for the people of Afghanistan, so the whole situation really can be described as exceptionally badly managed.""On Thursday, as the BRICS countries met, Pandor said countries agreed that they would only recognise the Taliban being in power if democracy was restored and human rights were in place.""We had a BRICS Summit yesterday in which our president spoke, and we've adopted a statement that is a BRICS statement, very clearly articulating the view that we want to see the restoration of democracy and enjoyment of fundamental human rights by the people of Afghanistan. Until we are assured that the government, once it's in place, intends to observe the prescripts of international law, we wouldn't proceed with any form of recognition.""South Africa was asked to temporarily receive Afghan refugees who fled the country before they reach their final destination in Pakistan. But Pandor said there were a number of concerns and SA refused. “We received a rather odd set of letters from South African based lawyers, asking that we receive two aeroplane loads of persons who had sought refuge in Pakistan, but would be transported to South Africa in order for United States authorities to vet them in South Africa, because some of them would be given the special immigration permit by the United States. Well firstly, we're not a vetting base, there is no international law requirement that they must proceed to a third country.”LISTEN: Minister Pandor on SA being on UK's red list and Afghan situationDownload the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.

Careful planning and engineering to drill 1.83m into the concrete-filled, iron and steel protected grave of the late Robert Mugabe is what it will take to fulfil a court ruling arrived at on Friday in the Chinhoyi magistrate's court in Zimbabwe.Regional magistrate Ruth Moyo threw out a court challenge by the late Mugabe’s children, Bona, Bellarmine and Tinotenda Mugabe. The trio argued that Chief Zvimba acted outside his jurisdiction when his traditional court presided over the burial issue of their father.The magistrate, in her judgment, said the children have no say in the matter because it directly involved their mother. But Grace Mugabe, the late statesman's wife, has been out of Zimbabwe for well over a year now. Family sources say she’s in Singapore, where she  sought medical treatment and never returned. Zvimba’s court in May this year ruled that Robert Mugabe’s remains must be exhumed and reburied at the National Heroes Acre because his widow, Grace, broke local customs by interring him at his rural home. The chief also fined Grace fined five cows and a goat in absentia.But the family rejected the ruling made by Zvimba, and approached the magistrate’s court.Mugabe died two years ago this month, aged 95. His burial came just over a month after his death,  after a protracted dispute between government and the Mugabe family, led by Grace, about where he should be buried.The government wanted Mugabe buried at the National Heroes Acre, where he began a culture of honouring heroes of the war to gain independence from Rhodesia. However, because of bad blood between him and the government of his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, which removed him from power with the help of the military, Mugabe’s dying wish was not to be buried by his “tormentors”.Because of Zvimba calling for the exhumation and reburial of Mugabe, the family is at loggerheads with all traditional leaders in Zvimba village.Speaking at the burial of Chief Beperere, a member of the Mugabe family, Dominic Matibiri, was quoted by Voice of America as saying that he wouldn't mourn the chief, who died of Covid-19 last week due to him “taking part in the exhumation calls”.“Chief Beperere was Mugabe's chief and should have presided over the matter, but decided to trick us by taking the matter to Chief Zvimba ... This is a great anomaly,” Matibiri was quoted as saying.Mugabe died an MDC Alliance supporter having publicly endorsed Nelson Chamisa and voted for him in the disputed July 2018 general elections.TimesLIVE",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg

Trump was not at the Ground Zero memorial this morning. He is expected to visit at some point today. During a Fox News interview Friday, Trump said that he would be going to Manhattan. Trump is from New York City. “I love great fighters and great fights. I look forward to seeing both this Saturday night and sharing my thoughts ringside. You won’t want to miss this special event,” the AP quoted Trump as saying. Kamala Harris has just spoken at the Shanksville memorial ceremony, where she emphatically called for the US to come together, as passengers and crew of Flight 93 did on 9/11 to fight the hijackers. Their act of heroism is believed to have thwarted an attack on the US Capitol. “We are gathered today on hallowed ground, at this place that has been sanctified by sacrifice, to honor the heroism that the 40 passengers and crew members showed in the face of grave terrorism,” Harris said. “On the days that followed September 11, 2001, we were all reminded that unity is possible in America. We were reminded, also, that unity is imperative in America. It is essential to our shared prosperity, to our national security, and to our standing in the world. And by unity, I don’t mean uniformity. We had differences of opinion in 2001, as we do in 2021, and I believe that in America, our diversity is our strength.”“That time reminded us [of] the significance and the strength of our unity as Americans, and that it is possible in America,” Harris said. “So moments from now, we will leave this hallowed place, still carrying with us the pain of this loss, this tremendous loss, and still the future will continue to unfold. We will face new challenges, challenges that we could not have seen 20 years ago, and we know that what lies ahead is not certain,” she said. “It is never certain. It has never been. But I know this: if we do the hard work of working together as Americans, if we remain united in purpose, we will be prepared for whatever comes next.”“The 40 passengers and crew members of Flight 93, as we all know, they didn’t know each other, most of them didn’t know each other, they were different people from different places, they were on that flight for different reasons,” Harris continued. “But they did not focus on what may separate us, no, they focused on what they all share ... the humanity that we all share.”“In a matter of minutes, in the most dire of circumstances, the 40 responded as one. They fought for their own lives, and to save the lives of countless others at our nation’s Capitol.”“After today, it is my hope and prayer that we continue to honor their courage, their conviction, with our own—that we honor their unity by strengthening our common bonds, by strengthening our global partnerships, and by always living out our highest ideals.” “This work will not be easy, it never has been, and it will take all of us, believing in who we are as a nation, and it will take all of us going forth to work together,” Harris said. During his address, Bush criticized the divisiveness that plagues the US, saying that it turns “every argument into a clash of cultures”.“So much of our politics has become a naked appeal to anger, fear,” he said. Bush said that the group of Americans on Flight 93, and the country’s response to 9/11, showed that this country can be unified. “I come without explanations or solutions. I can only tell you what I’ve seen. On America’s day of trial and grief, I saw millions of people instinctively grab for a neighbor’s hand and rally to the cause of one another. That is the America I know,” Bush said. “Twenty years ago, terrorists chose a random group of Americans, on a routine flight, to be collateral damage in a spectacular act of terror,” Bush also said. “The terrorists soon discovered that a random group of Americans is an exceptional group of people.” “These Americans were brave, strong, and united in ways that shocked the terrorists – but should not surprise any of us,” he said. “This is the nation we know.”George Bush, now speaking at the Shanksville memorial, said “there was horror at the scale of destruction” on 9/11. “There was shock at the audacity of the evil,” he remarked, “and gratitude at the heroism and decency that opposed it.” “The actions of an enemy revealed the spirit of the people, and we were proud of our wounded nation.”Bush praised the passengers and crew of Flight 93, saying “here, the intended targets became the instruments of rescue” and that many who are alive today owe their lives to them. Gordon Felt, president of the Families of Flight 93, has addressed the memorial ceremony in Shanksville. Felt’s brother, Edward, was on Flight 93. Passengers and crew on Flight 93 fought back against the hijackers, and it is believed their actions prevented the terrorists from crashing the plane into the US Capitol. “Having lost a brother on September 11, I too live with the grief that is deep, consuming, and always present. For those that lost loved ones in the terrorist attacks on our country 20 years ago today, you know that we can never move on — but that we must continue to move forward,” he said. Felt said: “There are still many questions to be answered about that day, facts to be declassified and released”, as well as justice to be done. He said that the victims, who were mostly strangers, “found the courage to band together at a moment’s notice” without regard to their political, religious, and cultural differences. Under these extreme conditions, they “were able to change the course of history” so that the final image of 9/11 would not be an attack on the Capitol, which would have been “The greatest symbol of our democracy in ruins.”Vice-President Kamala Harris is in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at the memorial ceremony remembering the victims of Flight 93. At 10.03am on September 11 2001, Flight 93 crashed into a field near this small town.The crew and passengers of this flight fought back against the hijackers. Their heroism is thought to have prevented the hijackers from crashing the plane into the US Capitol. George Bush, who was US president on 9/11, is also present in Shanksville. Harris is expected to be the keynote speaker. Bush is also expected to give remarks. The US Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, spoke at the Pentagon memorial ceremony, where he expressed his condolences and said that America must be “tireless” in protecting its values of liberties, rights, and the rule of law. “On behalf of the Department of Defense, let me renew our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of all those lost on 9/11, including the 184 souls taken from us in the attack on the Pentagon, in the building, and on Flight 77. We know that you carry pain every day. We know that you bear your losses—not just at times of ceremony, but also in ordinary moments of absence, in quiet minutes that can seem to stretch on for hours,” Austin said. “All of us are here because we remember, and I hope knowing that is at least some measure of comfort.” “We know that the memories can be hard to bear. We know the sorrow doesn’t end. But over the years, we hope, that the good memories come to us more often and more easily. And today, we remember not just who our fallen teammates were, we remember the mission that they shared, and we recall their common commitment to defend our republic and to squarely face new dangers,” Austin also said.Austin later remarked that “as years march on, we must ensure that all our fellow Americans know and understand what happened here on 9/11, and in Manhattan, and in Shanksville Pennsylvania. It is our responsibility to remember, and it is our duty to defend democracy.”“We cannot know what the next 20 years will bring. We cannot know what new dangers they will carry. We cannot foresee what Churchill called the ‘originality of malice,’ but we do know that America will always lead and we do know the only compass that can guide is through the storms ahead, it is our court values and the principles enshrined in our Constitution—liberty, rights, the rule of law, and the fierce commitment to a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.”“It is our job to defend the great experiment that is America, to protect this exceptional republic, body and soul, and to defend the American people in our democracy even when it’s hard, especially when it’s hard,” Austin also said. “Ladies and gentlemen, we must be tireless guardians of our ideals as well as our security because we cannot have one without the other.”Barbara Lee, who was working at the Pentagon on 9/11, was among those who attended a private memorial there. “I think it’s appropriate that we remember, we remember the people that we lost, we remember the families,” Lee told USA Today. “It’s just kind of sad day.”Richard Keller and his wife attended the Pentagon memorial ceremony to honor his son, Chandler Keller. The 29-year-old, who was on American Airlines Flight 77, which left Dulles airport for Los Angeles, was killed on this flight. “We lost him on that day, and we’ve been back almost every year to remember him,” Keller told USA Today. “We’ve had the blessing of a wonderful family and friends that have kept us whole throughout all this.”Keller also remarked: “We just can’t believe it’s been 20 years. “We’re tried hard to keep his memory alive.”Abdelalim Abdelbaky’s grandfather operated a food stand near Ground Zero. He was working on September 11 and witnessed the attacks. “My grandfather was here that day. He couldn’t believe what he saw. It affected everyone—Muslims, Christians, Jewish. Everybody cried that day,” Abdelbaky told The Guardian’s Edward Helmore. “He said to me he said his customers from the towers were good people. He couldn’t believe that they were lost,” he continued. “That’s why I love to keep my cart next to Ground Zero, in his name.” Thea Trinidad, whose father was killed during the 9/11 attacks, signed up to read the victims’ names during today’s ceremony. Trinidad was just 10-years-old.“It’s hard because you hoped that this would just be a different time and a different world. But sometimes history starts to repeat itself and not in the best of ways,” Trinidad told the Associated Press. She overheard her father, Michael, telling her mother goodbye over the phone, calling her from the World Trade Center. Trinidad told AP that while she recalls the pain, she also remembered how the city came together and New York “felt like it was family.”“Now, when I feel like the world is so divided, I just wish that we can go back to that,” Trinidad also commented. “I feel like it would have been such a different world if we had just been able to hang on to that feeling.”Bruce Springsteen has performed the song, “I’ll see you in my dreams” during the 9/11 memorial ceremony at Ground Zero. The names of victims are being read. Edward Helmore has spoken with Ken Corrigan, 54, a firefighter working at Ground Zero on 9/11. “Like every year, it’s hurtful. I lost friends in the fire department, in the police department, the guys who went over to Iraq and Afghanistan. When we left our firehouse in the Bronx to race down here, we were told a second aircraft had hit and all units were driving into a war,” Corrigan said. “A lot of my guys didn’t understand what that meant. They asked me what does that mean? They couldn’t fathom what we were going into. I said, somebody declared war on us,” Corrigan continued. “We were told that people were trapped in the towers. To this day, I look up for those towers. To see the way the sky is today, 20 years ago, same thing. It scares me. Scares the living daylights out of me.”“To not know if you were going to live or die when those towers came down is something that never leaves you. I’m a survivor of the World Trade Center—twice,” he recalled. “We were in subway station when they collapsed and we’re able to find our way out. Thank God, none of my guys died, but our rig got crushed.”Mike Low, whose daughter, Sara Low, was a flight attendant on American Airlines Flight 11, which struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 am on 9/11, addressed the mourners during the memorial ceremony.Low, who had only been a flight attendant for several years, boarded the California-destined flight at Boston’s Logan Airport early that morning. After the terrorists took control of the flight, authorities think that she gave her telephone calling card to another flight attendant, Madeline Amy Sweeney—who then used an on-plane phone to deliver key information to the ground, . While 9/11 “felt like an evil specter descended on our world,” Low said, it revealed the courage of many. The first of six moments of silence took place at 8:46 am. The ceremony began just after 8:40 a.m., with The US national anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner. The Guardian’s Edward Helmore is in Downtown Manhattan, where the memorial ceremony will soon begin at Ground Zero. Helmore reports: The streets of lower Manhattan were sealed off Saturday, the sky as clear as it had been on the day 20 years ago when the terrorist attacks took place.As firefighters and police, the families of those lost on 9/11, military who had served in the Afghan and Iraq wars, assembled near Ground Zero for the remembrance, there was a pervasive sense of sorrow and respect.“My feelings today are of sadness,” Sean O’Malley, heading to the memorial to play in the FDNY band. O’Malley, who was off-duty that day and called in to respond, was assembling a team of firefighters when the towers came down.“It just feels like yesterday. It really does. The loss doesn’t get less, and the pain is certainly still there. It doesn’t lessen with years, you just get to shoulder the burden a little easier. So many wives, lots of families and communities were impacted. So many people who didn’t get to see their children grow up, see them off to college.”Hello, Guardian readers.Today marks the 20th anniversary of 11 September 2001. On this somber day, America will grieve for victims of the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington DC that killed nearly 3,000 people, sparked long, bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and dramatically altered the course of the 21st century. Twenty years ago, al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes and steered two of them into the World Trade Center. Victims from across the world were killed in these first explosions. Some jumped to their deaths. Others were killed in the collapse, while millions watched the horrific events unfold on live television. Al-Qaida terrorists slammed another airplane into the Pentagon, which is the headquarters of the US armed forces near Washington, ripping a hole into the building’s side. The fourth airplane, which may have been destined for the US Capitol, plummeted into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, as passengers heroically fought back against the hijackers. In total, 2,977 died, with 2,753 victims at Ground Zero in Manhattan. The death toll exceeds fatalities on the “day of infamy” at Pearl Harbor in 1941.While Biden might have wanted the 20th anniversary of 11 September 2001 to provide even a brief sense of unity across the deeply divided US, sharp criticism over the recent US withdrawal from Afghanistan continues. Following the tumultuous departure of American forces from Kabul less than two weeks ago, which ended the US’s longest war, the Taliban have regained control of Afghanistan. This has stoked fears that Afghanistan – which was controlled by the Taliban on 9/11 – will once again turn into a safe harbor for terrorists.

"Exhausted, out of food: How 4 fugitives were caught, with help of Arab Israelis - The Times of Israel
Five days into a national manhunt for six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from a high-security jail in northern Israel, police captured two of the fugitives in Nazareth Friday night. Hours later, two others — including notorious terror commander Zakaria Zubeidi — were apprehended in the nearby town of Shibli–Umm al-Ghanam.In both cases, Arab Israelis who encountered the fugitives reported them to authorities, aiding in their capture. Police sources told Walla news that dozens of Arabs phoned in reports in recent days.The fugitives had managed to avoid capture since breaking out of Gilboa Prison early Monday.Two of their fellow escapees remained on the run.Police sources told the Ynet news site on Saturday that despite earlier assessments that the prisoners had had outside help and that a getaway vehicle had driven them away, authorities now believed they’d acted alone and ha traveled on foot the entire time.In Nazareth on Friday evening, police caught convicted Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists Yaquob Qadiri and Mahmoud al-Arida, the latter of whom was reported to have masterminded the jailbreak.Prior to their arrests, the two requested food from residents of Nazareth, but locals rejected their request and alerted police, according to Hebrew media.Some reports said residents noticed al-Arida and Qadiri digging through trash, apparently searching for food.Neither resisted arrest and video showed police putting the handcuffed detainees in patrol cars.The next two to be captured were Zubeidi and Mohammed al-Arida, the reported mastermind’s younger brother. The two were caught early Saturday morning.According to Haaretz, the two were earlier sighted out in the open by a dune buggy driver from a nearby village, and requested a ride. He refused and later reported them to the police. Military trackers then found their footprints in the dirt, as well as discarded cigarettes and a drink can.3 גששים במילואים שחזרו את נתיב הבריחה – והביאו לתפיסת זביידיאין על השיטות של פעם — ????????Avi Noga???????? (@AviNoga3) September 11, 2021The trackers managed to follow the clues to Zubeidi and al-Arida, who were hiding in a parking lot used by truck drivers.
Al-Arida was found sleeping in a semi-trailer while Zubeidi was captured nearby as he wandered around exhausted.

A security official said Zubeidi briefly tried to escape during the arrest, but was quickly overpowered. Photos from the scene showed Zubeidi with what appeared to be a large bruise on his face, but it was not clear if this was sustained during the arrest.
A local resident later told reporters that the two appeared scared and hungry when they were caught.

Public Security Minister Omer Barlev vowed the remaining two fugitives would be caught and also thanked Arab Israelis “who assisted in the capture of the terrorists.”
“For four days the escapees wandered around believing they would find shelter and help among Arab Israelis, but they were mistaken,” Barlev tweeted. “Everywhere they turned, Arab citizens refused them and called police. Much respect to all the responsible citizens!”
Before the escape, Zubeidi, a commander in Fatah’s Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, was imprisoned while on trial for two dozen crimes, including attempted murder.

Mohammed al-Arida was arrested in 2002 on terror offenses and sentenced to life in prison while his brother Mahmoud al-Arida, considered a senior Islamic Jihad member, was jailed for life for terrorist activity, including attacks in which soldiers were killed.
Qadiri was also serving life terms for acts of terrorism including the murder of an Israeli in 2004. Both he and Mahmoud al-Arida were reportedly involved in a 2014 attempt to break out of Gilboa.
The two prisoners still on the run are Iham Kamamji and Munadil Nafiyat, who like the other fugitives are from the area around the northern West Bank city of Jenin.
Kamamji was serving a life sentence at the time of the escape for killing an 18-year-old Israeli in 2006, a murder he reportedly expressed pride in.
Nafayat has not been charged with a crime and was being held under Israel’s practice of administrative detention, which allows it to imprison suspects without filing charges for security purposes.

For some Palestinians, the fugitives have been widely regarded as “heroes” who succeeded in freeing themselves from multiple life sentences.
Violent protests broke out at a number of locations in the West Bank after the announcement of the first arrests on Friday evening. The Hamas terror group said their detention would not “break their will.”
Shortly afterwards, a rocket was fired from Gaza toward Israel, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile defense system. There were no reports of injuries or damage. The Israel Defense Forces said it responded with airstrikes on a number of terror targets in the enclave.
Islamic Jihad also celebrated the escapees and warned Israel against any harm coming to them while in detention.
The six escaped from Gilboa Prison in the pre-dawn hours of Monday morning, making their way out through their cell’s drainage system and an empty space underneath the prison.

Israeli forces have scrambled to find the inmates, all of them highly dangerous. In recent days, Israeli troops have arrested several of the fugitives’ family members, including five who were arrested in villages near the northern West Bank city of Jenin in the predawn hours of Friday morning, according to Palestinian media.
The escape exposed a series of failures at the prison and Barlev said Thursday that he had decided to form a government commission to probe the incident.
Among the apparent lapses were failure to learn lessons from previous escape attempts and a catalog of operational blunders, including unmanned watchtowers and sleeping guards.

Remember “death panels”? Well, they’re back, and this time, they’re real.“Death panels” was a phrase coined by Sarah Palin, the folksy-talkin’ former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate. She imagined that Obamacare would cause health bureaucrats to ration out medical care, after first sitting in judgment of who was most deserving to receive it.This was awarded the “Lie of the Year” in 2009, as it was nowhere in any legislation. It was a right-wing fever dream.But now a version of it has come true — in Idaho. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the state has declared an emergency, called “crisis standards of care.” It means when you show up to the emergency room, you may get treated based preferentially on who is most likely to live.“If your mother has a heart attack, someone will have to assign her a point score designating how likely she is to survive,” the , describing the scheme last winter when it was first being contemplated. “If it isn’t high enough, she might not get an ICU bed, and a COVID patient will get it instead.“We will ask the nurses and doctors who’ve broken their backs trying to save us to make that Sophie’s choice over, and over, and over.”This past week the 200-bed hospital in Coeur d’Alene had 218 “med surge” patients — so many it was treating patients in hallways and running out of oxygen to help them breathe, .“What about the people who need emergency care but, because of the exploding COVID crisis here, can’t get it?” . “Do we just let them die?”The answer to that is: “Yes.” Letting them die is actually the plan. The GOP governor of Idaho said it was  But he made no moves to try anything else, such as requiring vaccinations for anyone (he earlier had  in the state). It’s a red state, and so for the most part they’re letting the virus rip and run.Remember years ago when a tea party debate audience cheered the idea of letting someone without insurance die? What’s happening in Idaho is even worse because it’s so preventable.Doctors in Idaho have said their COVID-19 patients are almost all unvaccinated. “We don’t have any vaccinated patients here,” an ICU doc in Boise told The Associated Press. “Misinformation is hurting people and killing people.”Idaho ranks last in the percentage of its population having at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, at only 45%. The U.S. is about 63%; Washington state 69%.But Idaho is not the only place where the “death panel” concept is creeping into the conversation. The main hospital in Yakima is seeing a record number of COVID-19 patients, almost all unvaccinated. They’re raising the specter of rationing care there, too — something the chief medical officer said has never happened at the hospital.“I sure hope we don’t get there, but that’s where we’re heading,” he -Republic on Wednesday.When I wrote last week about a , asking whether society should care, I heard from a slew of readers furious because their own medical care is being delayed or cut off — a diffuse version of the triage going on in Idaho.“Am I angry? You bet I am,” wrote Mike Morrissey, of Snohomish, who says his cardiac surgery has been put off indefinitely due to a flood of COVID-19 patients. “My heart is failing without intervention. I can’t walk a block without stopping. But their choice [to not get vaccinated] just negated my urgent need.”Echoed a nurse at a regional hospital: “They’re dying of stupidity by choice, but at the same time taking up space in the hospital and displacing stroke, cancer and cardiac patients.”“Do I care what happens to those who won’t take a simple step to end this nightmare?” asked reader Jon Kraus, who said his brother-in-law had a surgery to fix a painful back condition put on hold due to COVID-19 levels. “I’m tired of catering to people who don’t care about anyone but themselves.”This is why Gov. Jay Inslee and President Joe Biden suddenly feel more comfortable . Yes, the right-wing flank of the GOP will sue, march around in tri-corner hats and scream at their local school boards. But people are done. The vaccinated — the majority in most states — have had enough.Now, as the workplace vax wars rev up, the best point to keep in mind is offered up by reader Michael Andreoni:“Who I DO feel sorry for are the medical personnel who have to deal with this mess,” he wrote.It’s the story of our time, how a pandemic that was visited upon us, through no fault of our own, ended up morphing into such a self-inflicted wound for America.It didn’t take a tyrant or a deep state or a committee of banal bureaucrats to bring death panels to life, as Sarah Palin imagined in her fever dream.

    The United States has withdrawn some of its defense missiles from Saudi Arabia amid ongoing attacks levied against the country by Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthis, The Associated Press reported.The wire service analyzed satellite footage from Plant Labs Inc., which showed that the Prince Sultan Air Base previously had a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense unit and a missile defense system in addition to Patriot missile batteries. Several batteries were no longer at the air base, according to footage taken near the end of August and reviewed by the AP.The news outlet noted that the missile system and batteries appeared to be gone after analyzing photos taken on Friday.Following inquiries from the AP, Pentagon press secretary John KirbyJohn Kirby    conceded that “certain air defense assets” had been redeployed.“The Defense Department continues to maintain tens of thousands of forces and a robust force posture in the Middle East representing some of our most advanced air power and maritime capabilities, in support of U.S. national interests and our regional partnerships,” Kirby told the AP.The Hill has reached out to U.S. Central Command for comment.Earlier this year, the Pentagon said that “certain forces and capabilities” would be pulled out of the Middle East.“The secretary of Defense directed the commander of U.S. Central Command to remove from the region this summer certain forces and capabilities, primarily air defense assets,” Pentagon spokesperson Cmdr. Jessica McNulty said in a statement.McNulty explained that the move was made in “close coordination with host nations” and that it was ""about maintaining some of our high demand, low density assets so they are ready for future requirements in the event of a contingency.”The Saudi Arabia's defense ministry also conceded in a statement to the AP that defense missiles had been removed but maintained the move was done through a “common understanding and realignment of defense strategies.”“The redeployment of some defense capabilities of the friendly United States of America from the region is carried out through common understanding and realignment of defense strategies as an attribute of operational deployment and disposition,” the ministry said in their statement.The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2021  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.
