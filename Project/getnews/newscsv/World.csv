It’s a summit bringing together world leaders, scientists, activists and business leaders in an effort to curb global warming (and in the process, save the planet).COP stands for the ‘Conference of the Parties’ under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.The parties usually meet every year. This is the 26th time since the first COP meeting in 1995 in Berlin; the Glasgow summit was delayed by a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The 2015 Paris Agreement saw signatories commit to keeping global temperature increases to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels, preferably to 1.5C.To succeed in that challenge, countries agreed to set their own emissions reduction targets, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). You’ll hear NDCs mentioned a lot over the next couple of weeks.The problem is that the existing NDCs for most countries are nowhere near tough enough.The United Nations estimates that under the current pledges by Paris Agreement signatories, there will be a 16 per cent increase in emissions by 2030, compared with 2010 levels.Climate experts say the world should be aiming for at least a 45 per cent reduction in that period. So, COP26 is an opportunity for world leaders to submit updated targets that will help achieve the goals set out in Paris.  World leaders, environmental campaigners (probably Greta Thunberg), business leaders and thousands of diplomats and climate scientists. An estimated 25,000 people in total. But much of the focus in the lead up to COP26 has been on who is not attending.                                                   Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will not be there, nor will Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin insists the Russian president takes climate change seriously and he will participate virtually.Organisers are still waiting on a final decision from Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has not travelled abroad since the COVID-19 pandemic began.China is responsible for 27 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, meaning its participation is vital. But some China analysts believe Mr Xi's physical presence isn’t needed for progress to be made.“Xi Jinping didn’t travel for the two previous UN General Assemblies in which he made major announcements about China’s climate goals, so I don’t know that it means anything,” said Lauri Myllyvirta of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.“What really matters is whether China’s going to continue increasing its emissions until later this decade, as the current pledges allow, or whether we see some more commitments to curb emissions rise during this decade.”Last year, China committed to reaching net zero emissions by 2060, but new coal plants are still being built to meet its enormous energy needs.When Prince Charles was told Prime Minister Scott Morrison wasn’t sure he’d be able to make it to Glasgow, he was taken aback.“Is that what he says, does he? Mmm...” .Eventually, Mr Morrison confirmed he would attend, even if negotiations with his Nationals coalition partners over a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 were still underway.He’s likely to face pressure from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden to set a concrete emissions reduction target for 2030. “We have to reduce emissions very substantially this decade to have a chance of meeting the Paris climate goals,” said Professor Lesley Hughes of the Climate Council.“We're now a week from what is probably the most important climate meeting of our lifetime and Australia is still scrambling to come up with some sort of policy.”Mr Morrison is unlikely to agree to a formal increase of Australia’s 2030 target and will instead trumpet overachievement on the current goals. Many countries aren’t keen to do their assigned homework; that is, they don’t want to update their existing climate goals. Among those yet to update their emissions reduction targets are big polluters including China and India. “We need all of the countries to put their pledges on the table, to make sure we’re halving global emissions in the next eight years really, which is not long at all,” said Kate Blagojevic from Greenpeace UK.“On top of that, there should be detailed plans of action as to how every country’s going to actually meet their targets. If they contain huge loopholes that all countries and corporations to keep offsetting, then we will be incredibly worried the targets will not be met.”There will also be some arguments over climate financing.Twelve years ago, wealthy nations agreed to raise $100 billion a year to help developing nations curb emissions and deal with the effects of global warming.But that target has never been met and talks are needed to decide who’ll cover the shortfall. That depends on who you ask.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the summit host, says he wants to see progress on “coal, cars, cash and trees”. That’s eliminating coal power, encouraging the transition to electric vehicles, finally meeting the climate financing pledge and ending deforestation.But the most important outcome will be the climate targets set by individual countries; those NDCs.“Some success is built-in; there will be revised NDCs, so at the very minimum level there will be an improvement on the Paris climate deal,” said Professor Martin Siegert of London’s Grantham Institute. “But will it be sufficient to guarantee temperatures are held to below 2C and preferably 1.5C? Unless something remarkable happens, I’m not sure that’s possible.”",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"New Zealand reports second-highest daily COVID-19 cases in pandemic - ABC News

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, Singapore: Chinese authorities have placed a city of 4 million people under lockdown in an attempt to wipe out a coronavirus outbreak that has threatened the country’s COVID-zero strategy.Residents in Lanzhou, north-western China, were told not to leave home except in emergencies after six cases were recorded on Tuesday.In Beijing, authorities are scrambling to lockdown apartment blocks and towns as coronavirus cases pop up across the mainland.The sudden restrictions come 100 days out from the start of the Winter Olympics and two weeks before a key Chinese Communist Party meeting in Beijing.A worker stands at the entrance to Wuquan Mountain which is closed to prevent visitors gathering in Lanzhou city in Gasu province, north-west China, on Monday.Credit:Chinatopix/APLockdowns have been re-imposed for thousands of residents across 11 provinces after more than 120 cases were disclosed in the past week. The case numbers are a fraction of those recorded in Europe, the United States or Australia, but China’s zero-tolerance approach has forced a sharp response from authorities.Beijing residents have been told to avoid non-essential travel, access to tourist sites has been restricted and a marathon for 30,000 runners has been postponed. Apartment blocks where COVID clusters have sprung up have been put into strict lockdowns of up to 21 days. In one district a 20-year-old was arrested and put in detention for 10 days after he refused to scan a health code.Beijing resident Xu Dongjie said thousands of people in her community of Baigezhuang had been blocked from leaving home since October 22 and were in a 21-day lockdown.“Such strict control and prevention measures better fit in China than anywhere else,” Xu said. “Because population intensity in Chinese cities is so high, the consequences without timely and effective control and management are unimaginable.”Xu said her family would get all of their food delivered and her children would learn at home.“My children can’t go to school and because it happened all of a sudden, their teachers could not arrange online classes,” she said. “So now I act as the teacher of Chinese, math, physics, and English, although I’m not good at them.”Similar restrictions are now set to fall on pockets throughout the country as infections flare up from Inner Mongolia in the north to Hunan in the south.Medical workers in hazmat suits have also been seen outside Beijing’s Changping district where 23,000 people have been placed in lockdown, an unfamiliar sight in China since the early months of the pandemic.Masked residents line up to receive booster shots against COVID-19 at a vaccination site in Beijing on Monday.Credit:APThe government is expected to maintain its COVID-zero strategy in the mainland and Hong Kong despite its neighbours and all major economies moving to a “living with COVID” strategy.Authorities are also on alert for any disruption to the sixth plenum of the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee. The annual meeting starts on November 8 and will focus on the party’s role in the country’s history, according to Chinese State Media.Eliminating the coronavirus is expected to be a key achievement that President Xi Jinping takes to the National People’s Congress next October as he seeks a third term in power.Xi Jinping at the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing in June.Credit:APThe Winter Olympics in February will only allow domestic fans and all participants will be put into a “closed loop” bubble for the duration of the Games, with compulsory vaccines and daily testing, according to .The COVID-zero measures will also apply to the global financial hub of Hong Kong, frustrating companies that have called for relief from the 21-day quarantine period for business travellers.Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Tuesday she was not concerned and was “full of confidence about Hong Kong’s future”.“This is to give confidence to the central authorities that it is safe to open the border,” she said.The quarantine measures combined with high vaccination rates and sharp lockdowns have effectively neutralised the virus since mid-2020. Chinese medical authorities are now expanding the country’s vaccine rollout program after fully vaccinating more than 1 billion people.Children as young as three will start to receive the Sinovac and Sinopharm shots this week as older residents receive their booster shots to protect against the more infectious Delta variant.But another disease is also starting to raise concerns among medical experts. China reported 21 human infections with the H5N6 subtype of avian influenza this year to the World Health Organisation compared with only five in 2020. The number is lower than the previous strain H7N9 in 2017, but the infections are more serious and have caused at least six deaths.

"Facebook lines up $10 billion to build metaverse as next big computing platform - Moneycontrol
Facebook plans to spend at least $10 billion this year on Facebook Reality Labs as it looks to build the 'metaverse' - billed to be the next big computing platform.Facebook Reality Labs is responsible for the company's augmented and virtual reality-related hardware, software and content.""Metaverse is a major area of investment for us and an important part of our strategy going forward. Our goal is to help the metaverse reach a billion people and hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce this decade,"" Facebook cofounder Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's earnings conference call on Monday.""We are dedicating significant resources towards our augmented and virtual reality products and services, which are an important part of our work to develop the next generation of online social experiences,"" the social networking giant said in its earnings release. ""We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years.""Facebook's earnings comes amid one of the most difficult periods in the company's history as a trove of internal documents leaked by a Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen detail the social giant's various missteps and struggle in moderating content, especially in multilingual countries like India, its biggest market with over 340 million users.During the earnings conference call, Zuckerberg termed it as a ""coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company""He said when they make these decisions, they need to balance ""competing social equities"" like free expression with reducing harmful content, or enabling strong encrypted privacy with supporting law enforcement, or enabling research and interoperability with locking down data as much as possible.""It makes a good soundbite to say that we don't solve these impossible tradeoffs because we're just focused on making money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business, but about balancing different difficult social values"" Zuckerberg said.New Financial StructureIn an indication of how important the metaverse unit is becoming within Facebook, the firm is also recasting its financial reporting structure to break out Facebook Reality Labs as a separate reporting segment in its earnings reports from Q4 2021.""I recognise the magnitude of this bet on the future, and I am grateful for the support of our investors, the creative community, and the thousands of talented people working on this effort inside our company to bring this inspiring future to life,"" Zuckerberg said.He said that for the next few years, Facebook will focus on putting ""more of the foundational pieces into place"", an investment that is not going to be profitable for the company in the near future, but likely to mature over the next few years.""If we do a good job on this, and I would say later in this decade, is when we would, sort of, expect this to be more of a real business story,"" Zuckerberg said.He added that ""helping to shape the next platform"" would further reduce the company's dependence on delivering its services through its rivals. Apple is one such company which has had a significant impact on the company's advertising business in recent quarters through its new ad-tracking changes in the latest iOS update.Facebook also warned of significant uncertainty in Q4 due to ""continued headwinds from Apple's iOS 14 changes"".""We believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor of the mobile internet,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We think it's going to unlock a massively larger creative economy of both digital and physical goods than what exists today.""Zuckerberg is expected to share more details on the company's vision for the metaverse, apart from new at its annual Connect conference later this week. The company is also planning to rebrand itself that will focus on its work in building the metaverse, according to a The Verge report.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/userphoto/18451.jpg,"Explained: Climate targets set, missed - The Indian Express
The annual climate meetings have succeeded in galvanising the world into taking collective action against climate change, but they have not been able to prevent the crisis from worsening in the last two decades. The quantum of action that these series of meetings has enabled has always been well short of what, science says, is required to avoid the catastrophic impacts of climate change.Countries have missed their targets, reneged on promises made, and delayed their actions. The decision-making at these meetings has not always been guided purely by climate change considerations. Very often, economic and foreign policy imperatives have over-ridden environmental concerns.As a result, the world seems to have got locked in a perennial firefighting mode, struggling to cope with the ever-increasing frequency of extreme weather events, which are a direct consequence of global warming.Missed chancesFor most of the first two decades since climate change became a global issue — between 1990 and 2010 — very little action was taken to curb growing emissions. The first target, for the developed countries to return to their 1990 levels of emissions by 2000, was never taken seriously.An international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was finalised at just the third climate change conference, in Kyoto in 1997, but it couldn’t be operationalised until 2005 in the absence of the requisite number of ratifications. The United States, the world’s largest emitter at that time, did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol and was thus not bound by it.The Kyoto Protocol asked a group of 37 rich and industrialised countries to collectively achieve a modest 5 per cent reduction in their emissions from 1990 levels during the ‘first commitment period’ of 2008-2012. Except the European Union, and some of its individual member countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom (which was then in the EU), most of the countries did not achieve the target.Russia and the east European economies, however, saw a dramatic drop in their emissions after the collapse of the Soviet era. It helped a great deal in ensuring that the collective emissions of this group of countries fell by 22 per cent, well above the 5-per-cent target.Data from the World Resources Institute show that the emissions of the US in 2012 were marginally higher than they were in 1990, meaning there was no reduction. Australia’s emissions went up by about 15 per cent.Global emissions went up by 40 per cent between 1990 and 2012, thanks mainly to the rapid rise of China and India, which continues to this day. China overtook the United States as the world’s leading emitter around 2007. Its current emissions are more than 4 times the 1990 levels. India’s emissions have grown over 3.5 times from 1990.Newly growing economiesBut countries such as China, India and similar fast-growing economies such as Brazil, South Africa or Indonesia, were not mandated to cut down their emissions, because of well-justified reasons. Over 90 per cent of the accumulated greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the reason for global warming, had come from the rich and industrialised countries over the last 150 years. Countries such as India and China had begun to develop only in the 1980s and 1990s, and needed the space to grow their economies in order make the lives of their people better. This is what gave rise to the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC), the most endearing and empowering provision for the developing countries.But while they had little contribution in the “historical emissions”, industrial activity in China, India and other major developing countries was leading to their emissions growing at a very fast pace. That was a major grouse for the developed countries, which felt that a free pass to these countries was also handing them an unfair economic advantage at their cost.Thus began a systematic effort to erode the Kyoto Protocol and replace it with an architecture that put some constraints on the emissions of India and China as well. It was achieved with the finalisation of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and the formal demise of the Kyoto Protocol last year. In the process, the basic framework of the climate change architecture was severely diluted.Instead of science-based emission-reduction targets, that were binding in nature, countries were only asked to do what they thought they were best capable of. There is little incentive, and no obligation, for countries to put their best foot forward in a system like this.Lack of money, techMore than the lack of adequate action on emission reductions, the developed countries have been found wanting in their commitment to help and support developing countries, especially the least developed ones, in dealing with the impacts of climate change. This included providing money and technology to facilitate adaptation to the changing environment, something that the developed countries are mandated to do, not just under the Kyoto Protocol but also in the successor Paris Agreement regime.But hardly any meaningful amount of money, or transfer of technology, took place under the Kyoto Protocol. In 2009, at the Copenhagen conference, the then US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the developed countries would ‘mobilise’ $100 billion in “new and additional” climate finance for developing countries every year from 2020. This promise got written in the Paris Agreement as well.While the developed countries claim that this sum has already started flowing, developing countries say there is very little money on offer, and that a lot of what is being dressed as climate finance is actually pre-existing aid or money flowing for other purposes. Besides, $100 billion now seems like a paltry amount when estimates suggest that trillions of dollars are required in climate finance every year.Newsletter |

About 22.8 million people in Afghanistan, or half the country’s population will face acute food insecurity from November. This is what the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has warned about, referring to the findings from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report, which is issued by the Food Security and Agriculture Cluster of Afghanistan.The warning call came just months after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in August when US troops withdrew after being stationed there for over two decades.Recently, the Global World Hunger (GHI) index was also released, which ranked Afghanistan at 103, just two positions after India, which was ranked 101. Overall, 116 countries were considered for the index for the year 2021. The GHI index classified Afghanistan’s level of hunger as “serious”.There are various reasons because of which the WFP has sounded an alarm. These factors include the COVID-19 pandemic, drought and conflict, which have severely affected people’s ability to access food in the country. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) notes that hunger in Afghanistan has increased substantially since 2014 due to major droughts, floods and economic and security challenges.In October, Nikkei Asia reported that food prices are spiraling in Afghanistan as the local currency’s value is falling and imports from Pakistan–from which Afghanistan imports the highest share of food products–have fallen. Other countries from which Pakistan imports food products are India, South Korea, UAE, Turkey and Iran.Food insecurity in Afghanistan is not a recent reality, the country has been food insecure for a few years now.A 2007 USAID report on the food security situation in Afghanistan referred to a 2005 National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (NRVA) which summarised the food situation in the country as follows, “At the household level, food insecurity in Afghanistan is largely caused by inadequate access to food resulting from low household incomes.In fact, a 2010 UN report said that “Poverty actually kills more Afghans than those who die as a direct result of the armed conflict either accidental, nor inevitable; it is both a cause and a consequence of a massive human rights deficit.According to  published by the World Bank and the Afghanistan Government, as of 2018, agriculture has traditionally dominated Afghanistan’s economy and contributed towards a large share of its growth. Further, about 70 percent of Afghans live and work in rural areas, mostly on farms and about 61 percent of all households derive their income from agriculture.One of the key findings of the report was that the crop agriculture sub sector was not diversified enough and was overly concentrated on wheat. Further, while agriculture represented a high share of workers, their share of income was low because of limited market participation and a high number of unpaid family workers.According to anecdotal prices collected by the staff of the organisation called Save the Children, as of August 2021, in Kabul, the price of flour (50 kg) has increased by nearly 6 per cent, the price of oil (5 litres) by about 5.8 percent and of gas by 18.1 percent. In other areas such as Kunduz, the price of flour (50 kg) has increased by 40.6 per cent, of oil (5 litres) by 20 per cent, of beans by 30 percent and of gas by 63.4 percent. The comparison was made with what the prices were in July.In May, the World Bank noted that the pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity across vulnerable communities in Afghanistan. This is mainly because preventive measures such as lockdowns have caused border closures and disrupted productive activities and driven consumption down. “This is in addition to the widespread seasonal hunger due to conflicts, slow growth, drought, and high unemployment that has disproportionately impacted low-income urban and rural families,” it said.Around this time, the Afghan time rolled out the Dastarkhwan-e Meli to address hunger and growing unemployment in the vulnerable communities. By May, 750,000 Afghan households had received relief packages.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/10/2021-10-24T070504Z_891325717_RC27GQ9PMSCB_RTRMADP_3_AFGHANISTAN-CONFLICT-1.jpg

Share this article:“PEOPLE  in Africa are getting a raw version of Facebook which is more dangerous,” Frances Haugen said in her address to UK Members of Parliament. The Facebook whistle-blower has been giving evidence to UK MPs and peers scrutinising the online safety bill, amid calls for a toughening up of the landmark legislation.Haugen has triggered a deep crisis at Mark Zuckerberg’s social media empire after she released tens of thousands of internal documents detailing the company’s failure to keep its users safe from harmful content.The committee was set up to scrutinise the draft version of the bill before MPs start voting on the actual legislation as it starts its passage through parliament. This is a process sometimes used with bills to ensure potential problems are addressed before the voting starts. It is a mechanism that tends to be deployed when the issues are particularly complex, and the government is anxious to obtain cross-party support.Haugen left Facebook earlier this year, but took thousands of documents when she did so, providing them to the Wall Street Journal.That newspaper ran a series of articles which Facebook considered to be negative – and, it contends, mischaracterised the source material.But the allegations – that Facebook knew that Instagram was damaging to teenagers' mental health, for example – led to her being invited to testify to politicians and regulators around the world.Her appearance in London comes at a crucial time in the debate about tech regulation, as the Online Safety Committee considers additions and tweaks to the proposed new rules.Proposed additions include whether online abuse of women and girls should become a legal offence.Watch as Frances Haugen UK Members of Parliament:Share this article:",https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/320/?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/566aa526-e744-5cb8-88a8-68d727fe5f5f,"Dirco condemns detaining of Sudan PM, govt officials amid a 'coup' - Eyewitness News

"Japan’s Princess marries ‘commoner’ lover, stripped of royal status - The Independent
Japanese Princess Mako formalised her marriage with college lover and commoner boyfriend Kei Komuro on Tuesday and forfeited her royal status as dictated by Japanese law.Bringing their long-term relationship to fruition, the couple registered their marriage by signing paperwork at a local office in Tokyo’s Akasaka estate in the morning, according to the Imperial Household Agency.Ms Mako and her husband’s union, heavily criticised on the domestic front, was not a lavish, royal affair and did not have any elaborate rituals such as a grand reception by the Imperial family of Japan.She also rejected a monetary payment of 150 million yen (around £985,000) handed out to the female members of royal families who marry commoners and leave their family after marriage. She is the first woman from the royal family to deny both — rituals and the monetary gift.Ms Mako, dressed in a pale blue dress and holding a bouquet of flowers, left her home around 10am on Tuesday after bowing to her parents Crown Prince Fumihito and Crown Princess Kiko and hugging her younger sister Princess Kako. She waved to her parents before her car left the royal family’s residence.Princess Mako, right, hugs her sister Princess Kako, as their parents Crown Prince Akishino and Crown Princess Kiko watch, before leaving her home in Akasaka Estate in TokyoHer partner Mr Komuro bowed to cameras gathered outside his house as he left in a crisp dark suit and tie.The two have decided to forgo a formal meet with Mako’s uncle and aunt, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako before leaving Tokyo.The newlyweds are expected to address the media in a news conference later in the day and make a brief statement. Ms Mako and her husband will also hand out written answers to five preselected questions.“Some of the questions took mistaken information as fact and upset the princess,” an official from the Imperial Household Agency, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK.However, the written answers will be handed out because Ms Mako “feels a strong sense of anxiety” about answering questions verbally, the official added.Princess Mako and her college sweetheart Kei Komuro were engaged in 2017 The couple, who met in 2012 at the Tokyo’s International Christian University, will soon move to the US, where Mr Komuro studied and practises law. Ms Mako will also start her commoner employee life in New York at a Manhattan law firm.Years-long efforts to bring their relationship to fruition has been marred by controversy and strong disapproval from the general public, the press and political conservatives.The struggle of marrying a commoner and excessive sensationalist media coverage has left Ms Mako with post traumatic stress disorder, palace doctors have said.In line with criticism commoners receive after being wedded in the royal family’s fold, Mr Komuro has been under intense scrutiny, especially from Japan’s media. In the most recent display, Mr Komuro was heavily criticised for sporting a ponytail when he returned to Japan from the US last month, as media reports frowned upon the “unbecoming” hairstyle of someone marrying the princess.The radical shift in national mood for the wedding came as a surprise for many, as the couple were perceived to be an ideal one after they had announced their engagement in May 2017. Public perception had then seemed to be in the favour of the happy couple. One of the main hurdles that  stemmed from a financial dispute involving Mr Komuro’s mother over the spending of $36,000 (£25,832).

"US condemns Sudan military coup, pauses $700M in aid - Fox News
 The State Department said it was ""immediately pausing"" the emergency funds, which would have supported Sudan’s transition to a democratic government. Spokesman Ned Price said further assistance could also be at risk if military leaders did not reverse course and restore the civilian government.

      ""We firmly reject the dissolution of the civilian-led transitional government and its associated institutions and call for their immediate restoration. The arrest of Prime Minister Hamdok and other civilian leaders is unacceptable,"" Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said in a statement. ""The military forces must ensure their safety and release them immediately. These actions have the potential to derail the country’s transition to democracy and are a betrayal of Sudan’s peaceful revolution.""The military coup drew widespread condemnations from the international community, including the United Nations and the European Union. The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Tuesday afternoon.

      Blinken added the Biden administration was ""gravely concerned"" by reports of violence against protestors.""We are gravely concerned by reports that Sudanese security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters,"" he said. ""Security officials should immediately cease the use of violence against peaceful protesters. We also urge the restoration of Internet services.""The takeover occurred just weeks before the military was slated to transfer control of Sudan’s Sovereign Council to the civilian leaders. Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, Sudan’s top military official, announced he was dissolving the council due to political infighting.

      The coup occurred roughly two years after civilian demonstrations forced the ouster of Sudan’s longtime dictator, Omar al-Bashir.""The detention of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and several cabinet ministers, declaration of a state of emergency, shutting down of Internet and telecommunications services, and military takeover of state-run media are an affront to the democratic aspirations of the people of Sudan and undermine Sudan’s transition toward civilian-led democratic governance after 30 years of kleptocracy and violent dictatorship under Omar al-Bashir,"" United States Agency for International Development administration Samantha Power said in a statement.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/a44273f9-2dd0-4549-bff3-bd6c2fc4b7ef/85113dcc-8276-4d66-88c8-2abf69fdf7ad/1280x720/match/931/524/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1
