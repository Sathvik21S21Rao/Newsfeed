None of those patients are in ICU.Resilience NSW Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has been grilled over the allocation of money from the disaster fund established after the Black Summer bushfires.""People in northern New South Wales … are displaced, they are distressed, they have been overwhelmed as indeed the state has been overwhelmed by an unprecedented disaster,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said.Nine's Chris O'Keefe asked the commissioner if he was happy with his work and if he felt responsibility for the people of northern NSW.""With respect, this is not about me, it is about the many thousands of people who have been displaced and damaged emotionally and physically by flood events across northern New South Wales as was well documented, the flood heights were never expected to get anywhere near what was ultimately demonstrated.""Mr Fitzsimmons was then asked if he shared the Premier's view ""that this emergency response has fallen well short of expectations"".""I think this response effort has absolutely been overwhelmed by the unprecedented conditions that have been well documented and talked about from the beginning,"" he said.""I think there is a lot of people that have been disappointed and upset as a result of where they found themselves during these very, very difficult and indeed deadly times.""NSW SES Commissioner Carlene York is reminding people to ask for help if they need it and follow evacuation orders.Many communities cut off by floodwaters have been leading their own rescues and recoveries and have said they feel forgotten by the government.""We've partnered with Service NSW to open up a new phone line to assist those that need resupply, 13 77 88.

We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.New York: Mastercard and Visa are suspending their operations in Russia, the companies said, in the latest blow to the country’s financial system after its invasion of Ukraine.Under pressure over its dealings with Russia, Europe’s largest oil company, Royal Dutch Shell, said it will put profits from any Russian oil it purchases into a fund that will go towards humanitarian aid to Ukraine.A sign advertises payment services by Visa and Mastercard in the window of the Army of Russia store in Moscow. Both payment services said they would halt operations in Russia.Credit:BloombergMastercard said cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by its network and any Mastercard issued outside the country will not work at Russian stores or ATMs.“We don’t take this decision lightly,” Mastercard said in a statement, adding that it made the move after discussions with customers, partners and governments.Visa said it’s working with clients and partners in Russia to cease all Visa transactions over the coming days.“We are compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” Visa Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Al Kelly said in a statement.The twin suspensions were announced within 16 minutes of each other, and followed a private video call between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and US members of Congress in which he reportedly asked them “to turn off MasterCard and Visa for Russia”.Shell had on Friday bought a cargo of Russian crude oil at a record low discount, the first such trade since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.The deal, which did not violate Western sanctions on Moscow, was criticised by Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.“I am told Shell discreetly bought some Russian oil yesterday. One question to @Shell: doesn’t Russian oil smell [of] Ukrainian blood for you?,” Kuleba wrote in a tweet.In a statement published shortly afterwards, Shell defended the purchase and said it would choose alternatives to Russian oil wherever possible, but this could not happen overnight because of how significant Russia is to global supply.It added: “We didn’t take this decision lightly and we understand the strength of feeling around it.”Shell said it would give any profits from the limited amount of Russian oil it has to purchase to a dedicated fund, and together with aid agencies would determine where those funds would best be used to help alleviate hardship suffered by the people of Ukraine.Russian people have already been hit hard by heavy sanctions and financial penalties imposed by the US government and others.Since the invasion of Ukraine, the value of the Russian currency, the ruble, has plunged by more than a third to a record low. That’s pushing up inflation for Russian households, and all the fear has helped cause long lines at ATMs.Many other companies around the world have also made moves to increase the financial pressure on Russia and its people because of its attack on Ukraine. Some are selling their stakes in Russian companies, such as energy giant BP, while others like Harley-Davidson halted product shipments to the country.Many other companies, such as Volkswagen and Ikea, have suspended business there and pressure has grown on other brands to do the same. New York’s pension fund chief Thomas DiNapoli has in recent days written letters to several companies, including McDonald’s, PepsiCo and Estee Lauder, asking them to consider pausing their operations in Russia.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday compared the West’s sanctions on Russia to “declaring war”.“This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values,” Visa’s Kelly said.The moves by Mastercard and Visa could make real differences to their bottom lines. Russia accounted for 4 per cent of all of Visa’s net revenue in its last fiscal year, including money made from domestic and cross-border activities. Ukraine accounted for about 1 per cent, Visa said in a filing with US securities regulators this week.Mastercard said in its own filing that about 4 per cent of its net revenues during 2021 came from business conducted within, into and out of Russia. Another roughly 2 per cent was related to Ukraine.AP, Reuters",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.189%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_7/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/1f7440852d6567a46558a6c5c250fc072cfe6a9c,"How Shane Warne monetised his brilliant career - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.Shane Warne’s prodigious talent on the field and larger-than-life character off it made him one of cricket’s first stars to turn his extraordinary career into a financial gold mine.The exact extent of Warne’s wealth is difficult to quantify but a lavish lifestyle and string of high-end properties in Melbourne’s bayside suburbs hint at his success in parlaying sporting fame into lucrative sponsorship deals and a media career that lasted until his unexpected death on Friday.Shane Warne made around $1.5 million a year from media appearances. Credit:GettyWarne started his long-running relationship with Nine Network as a commentator in 1994, just two years into his international career, and by 2004 his appearances were earning him $300,000 a year.As his profile ballooned, sponsors followed. By 1999 he had minted a five-year deal with Nike worth $1 million, along with a $200,000 deal with Nicorette to quit smoking and endorsements for everything from Oakley sunglasses ($200,000 a year) to Just Jeans ($80,000) and tinned food maker SPC Ardmona.Like his playing career, though, controversy affected Warne’s business dealings.Media baron Kerry Packer personally called Warne to cancel his Nine contract in 2005 amid a string of high-profile sex scandals, while sponsors became harder to find after his one-year suspension in 2003 for taking a banned diuretic.But by the time he hung up the baggy green for good in 2007, he was back making $1.5 million a year in sponsorship deals, which included the hair-loss treatment service Advanced Hair.“When you throw a big number out there, you’re not really expecting to get it.”All was forgiven at Nine, too (Nine Entertainment Co is the owner of this masthead). The television network welcomed him back in 2008 and even gave him a short-lived talk show, Warnie. His first interview subject was Kerry Packer’s son James. Ratings were poor, however, and it wrapped up early.He remained part of Nine’s key on-air cricket talent until 2018 when he jumped to Fox Sports (his manager said he “would be the highest-paid” commentator there) after the pay TV network and Seven won the cricket broadcast rights. Along with appearances on UK broadcaster Sky, one industry source estimated Warne was netting about $1.5 million a year from commentary and TV appearances.Australia’s enduring fascination with Warne translated into a $2 million fee to appear in the 2016 season of Ten’s reality TV show I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here, which equalled the entire cast budget for the previous season.According to his 2018 autobiography, he told Ten he wanted “two million bucks or nothing”.“When you throw a big number out there, you’re not really expecting to get it”, he wrote. But he did get it, along with an agreement he could still smoke while filming in the South African bush and that his sponsors at Advanced Hair could fly out every three weeks to continue his treatment. While piddling compared with some international sports stars, his playing contracts were handsome, too. In 2003, the Australian Cricket Board reportedly paid him around $400,000 as a retainer plus $11,000 per Test match.On top of a $657,000 salary, he left after four seasons with a 3 per cent stake in the team. As of July 2021, the franchise was worth $340 million, valuing Warne’s stake at $10 million.Credit:APIn December 2019, the spinner said he hoped in a few years for the team to be worth $400 million. “Three per cent of $400 million is all right,” he told a podcast at the time.And with riches came the lifestyle. He paid $5.4 million for a five-bedroom home in Brighton in early 2018, installing a nightclub basement with a wet bar, mirrored ceiling and a noise-activated mirror ball. It boasted a 500-bottle wine cellar complete with tasting room, and a gold-class home theatre.He sold it in December 2020 for an unknown sum (the listing was for $6.8 million to $7.4 million), while paying $4 million for a 3000-square-metre property in Portsea’s Campbell Road and also planning to move into the luxury Saint Moritz development in St Kilda, where penthouses are priced from $9 million to $19 million.A keen poker player, he was a regular at tournaments around the world with $151,000 in live tournament winnings, according to World Poker Tour.There were business ventures, too. He launched a line of underwear – Spinners – in 2010 but the company managing the brand went bankrupt a year later. His mid-strength gin SevenZeroEight (a nod to his Test bowling record) launched two years ago and has fared better, with the Western Australian distillery pivoting to hand sanitiser during the pandemic. A treasure trove of the all-time great’s sporting memorabilia will also be worth a considerable sum, should anyone chose to sell it. Warne auctioned off his baggy green cap for $1 million to raise funds for victims of the 2020 bushfires.In 2004, he founded the Shane Warne Foundation, which was established to help ill and underprivileged children and teenagers. But it shut down in 2017, following revelations it was running at a  cents of every dollar raised to beneficiaries since 2011.The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.29%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_225/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/43c04503356468759abb1c43b8a99f81728b8269

"Ukrainian forces shoot down Russian aircraft on outskirts of Chernihiv | VIDEO - India Today
The Ministry of Defence of Ukraine has posted a tweet claiming air defence specialists have shot down a Russian attack aircraft. The incident took place on the outskirts of Chernihiv, a city in the northern part of Ukraine, on Saturday, March 5.The Ukrainian Air Force said that five Russian aircraft and 4 helicopters were downed on Saturday, March 5. Ukraine claims a total of 44 Russian planes and helicopters have been brought down.On Saturday, three Russian helicopters were shot down by Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv region in the southern part of the country.Meanwhile, on Sunday, Mastercard and Visa issued a statement saying they were suspending operations in Russia.Mastercard said that cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by its network and any card issued outside the country will not work at Russian stores or ATMs.“We don't take this decision lightly,” Mastercard said in a statement, adding that it made the move after discussions with customers, partners and governments.Also Read: ",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"German Ambassador to India: ‘Putin has made us open our eyes, that to keep peace, there might be a price’ - The Indian Express
Walter J Lindner talks about the Russian aggression on Ukraine, Germany’s lessons from history, putting pressure on Putin and the role of civil society. He was in conversation with Shubhajit Roy, Deputy Chief of National Bureau, The Indian Express.Shubhajit Roy: Did the Russian aggression against Ukraine come as a surprise to Germany?It came as a surprise to many of us. Nobody would have thought that President Vladimir Putin would brutally attack his neighbours. Let’s call a spade a spade, he lied to everyone. First they said, “We will build up troops of 50,000 (soldiers) around Ukraine. Don’t worry, nobody wants to invade, this is just for manoeuvre reasons.” Then he said, our troops are there as peacekeepers. A peacekeeper doesn’t bring bombs and doesn’t shell civilian houses. They bring, not water and not food, but death and destruction. The latest lies are about blaming the victims, that they are the ones who have taken hostages. Anyone can see that there is Russian aggression on a neighbour, which has a democratically elected government and parliament, is a member of the United Nations, and is not a small country; it has 40-plus million people. We are still in shock. Who would have expected this from a leader of a global power?🗞️  🗞️Shubhajit Roy: What is Germany’s assessment of why Putin is doing this?Germany and Russia have a very strong relationship. Without Mikhail Gorbachev there wouldn’t be a
reunited Germany. And what’s happening with Putin now, the war of Putin, I have no idea.Shubhajit Roy: Do you think Germany is so overly dependent on Russia for its energy needs that it had tied Germany’s hands in the past.It is true that we import a lot of our energy from the Russians. But I don’t think this has had too much influence on our political decisions. Since the Crimean occupation (in 2014), we have reduced our imports from Russia. We will be reducing it more. We also have to reduce the influx from Russia. Being the economic powerhouse in Europe, the sanctions from the German side are very drastic. We have put a freeze on the pipeline — Nord Stream. We have decided to increase our military budget and export weapons. We have never exported weapons into zones of tension. We have said this in the United Nations and in the German parliament. Democracy has its price and we are willing to pay it. Which means that inflation might go up, prices might go up. You can’t get freedom and democracy for nothing. We have lived in a peaceful time for 70 years. Two to three generations have taken things for granted and Putin has made us open our eyes, and to keep that peace, there might be a price.Shubhajit Roy: There’s also India’s dependence on Russia for its defence needs. Could India have done something different?I’m a German ambassador here so I’m not the one who gives unwanted advice. Every country has a different history and different dependencies on neighbours. India has brilliant diplomacy, excellent diplomats. I was in New York for three years and some of the best and skillful diplomats were Indians. They know what to do and how to judge this. But I’m sure everyone in the world agrees that we cannot have the law of the jungle prevailing.Anyone can see that there is Russian aggression on a neighbour, which is a democratically elected government, is a member of the United Nations, and is not a small country. We are still in shockKrishn Kaushik: Do you think Russia’s concerns of the eastward expansion of NATO is legitimate?I don’t want to go into a historic evaluation of who said what after the reunification of Germany. The fact is that NATO is a defence alliance. It’s not threatening anyone. And what happened after the (Berlin) Wall came down is that those countries who became independent, and were previously with the Soviet, had their own choices to see to which alliances they belong to. These countries opted for being members of the NATO and European Union; with Georgia and Ukraine, it was a bit different, because they were still having border disputes. So, it was never on the actual agenda to make them members of NATO. The discussion was not even on the table. To justify this kind of breach of international order, you need a fake narrative. So, they’re kind of bending history. And in this fast-living world, all these fake narratives have the tendency to prevail and influence people. If we let this happen, we all suffer.Krishn Kaushik: Are we moving towards a more militarised world?I grew up in a left-wing environment. We were protesting against the Vietnam War — make love, not war. Weapons are not a good thing. The world has to be a better place and fewer arms would be better than more arms because there are so many challenges. You have climate change, overpopulation, poverty reduction, there are so many things to do. We need money for this. So, what do we do? We have to spend more money for the military which instead should be spent for poverty reduction or on infrastructure. But Putin forces things on us. And that’s another thing which I don’t accept because he changed the world.Shubhajit Roy: Moscow’s policies are very clear, where it allows it to use nukes to end conflict. Where do you think this is going?So far, there was a kind of a taboo to threaten countries which are not in possession of nuclear weapons with nuclear weapons. We know what the repercussions of world wars have been. A third world war will be the end of us all. It’s irresponsible behaviour to threaten a nuclear world war which will end the planet. Who is he to do this?Shubhajit Roy: As a diplomat, what do you think it will take for a ceasefire to come in place?This is a lesson which we have learned in Germany, living on the edge of the Cold War with the Berlin Wall. In Berlin, where I live, there are still reminders of the Berlin Wall as a remembrance for our future generation. We have to always keep channels of communication open. We have called it the Ostpolitik, which led to the disappearance of the Wall. Negotiated ceasefire would be the just thing to do, of course. But let’s not comment from the outside. The Ukrainians are under threat of death and life and have to do this negotiation.Liz Mathew: Do you think other countries should also change the contours and terms of diplomatic relations with countries in the new world order?Shall we already call this a new world order? Shall we give Putin the right to define a new world order? Will a new world order be defined just by Putin and no one else? I think it’s important that the whole world says ‘no’ to Putin, with one voice. I think that’s a common understanding which we want to achieve in the world. I’ve talked to people who were in the UN meetings. Except a few of the diehards, like North Korea or Syria or Belarus, nobody is defending this. Sanctions are working already. Let’s hope that this contributes to changing Putin’s mind.Shahid Judge: Is this going to test the heft the West has in international politics and economy.I wouldn’t say this is a test for the West; it’s a test for the world. I don’t want to see it as a confrontation between East, West, North, South. No, it’s not. It’s between Putin and most of the rest of the world, except those five countries, maybe. If you see the situation in the voting patterns in the Security Council, the Russians were the only ones with a veto against their own condemnation. And they had the presidency of the Security Council. By the way, it shows how outdated the Security Council is, it doesn’t reflect the realities of today. So that’s why they had to move this from the Security Council to the General Assembly. If you see, there were 141 (countries condemning Russia). That is big in historical terms.Sourav Roy Barman: What explains the difference in reaction of European nations to refugees from Ukraine, who are being welcomed, and those in 2015 from Syria and Afghanistan?I wouldn’t share the view that this is a similar situation like 2015. What we have now is the aggression of one country towards another country, which is a democratically elected country. The United Nations Refugee Coordinator is expecting millions of people to flee from Ukraine. So that would be a massive movement. That’s why the European countries are saying, okay, you can come from Ukraine and even choose where you want to go in Europe, there will be no visa issue. It’s our answer to this brutal violation of norms. Our answer is: We are human, we take them in and we support them. Look at the support activities everywhere in Europe. Civilian groups, civil society, are collecting stuff, so are students in universities, wherever you go, football clubs, similar. They’re all supporting the freedom and independence of Ukraine. Maybe that’s why it’s not really comparable to what happened with the refugees who were running away from Iraq or Syria.Harikishan Sharma: Like Putin, there are strong leaders in other parts of the world. Do you think that they can also commit such mistakes?Putin here is acting as an authoritarian, autocratic person. So, you’re right, this might be a stimulus for others. That’s the additional danger, that this will set a precedent and then we will have the law of the jungle in international relations and nobody will win from that.Anil Sasi: How much of a surprise was the Sunday (February 27) Reichstag session? Was it expected that the action would be as severe (against Russia) on weaponisation, the energy aspect and the sanctions?Honest answer, I didn’t expect it and many didn’t expect it, because it’s a watershed. For Germany, it was maybe the biggest leap, because it is the European powerhouse and the financial and economic sanctions we are talking about would, of course, only make sense if Germany goes along. I think it was the call of the hour of our historic responsibility to make this leap. And we did in the face of the threat, which came there, and it shows the seriousness of this threat. And when he (Chancellor Olaf Scholz) presented this package of our reaction, there was a standing ovation afterwards, from left to right.Raj Kamal Jha: Why is Putin using the term ‘de-Nazification’?He draws on anything. What better use of the word ‘denazification’ because then everyone remembers World War II. He said denazification and demilitarisation. There are no NATO troops, there are just Ukrainian people there. You can see they’re going there with self-made Molotov cocktails and with lots of kitchen material on the streets. Where is the denazification? This is a part of the narrative he does and you see how often he has to repeat it. There are a lot of people in Russia, a vast majority, who are not feeling well with this, they might be ashamed of the President. People are going on the street in Petersburg, in other places. If you go out there, the next thing that happens is that you go to jail. Still, they go out, and still there are journalists who write about it. There is a brave civil society still out there.Shubhajit Roy: With Russian dependence on China for its economy, do you think there is a great amount of leverage that China has?Every country must see what kind of means they have to change Putin’s course. Every country has different kinds of history, relations, and dependencies with Russia. Every country should use its influence. Your Prime Minister has already talked to Putin several times.But you asked the question whether Putin first consulted China or not. I don’t know. You have to ask him. What let him do that and who said to him, “yes, we agree” or not, I don’t know. This is a speculation. It’s Putin’s war so he’s responsible for it.Krishn Kaushik: What are the red lines for NATO?An attack on NATO territory is a redline, it’s in the NATO Treaty. And Ukraine is not a NATO territory.Divya A: Will the relation between the people of Ukraine and Russia change with this situation?If you know the history of Russia, there is Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. So, they’re brothers. I’m sure that’s what you see sometimes on the streets. There is no problem between the people. But it will of course, change their attitude towards Putin and his regime.Shubhajit Roy: When chancellor Angela Merkel was around for more than 16 years, there was a great deal of stability. Now, we have the new Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Does the country feel the absence of Merkel?Merkel left huge shoes to fill. But it would be unfair to expect from a new chancellor to have 16 years of experience. But he has been mayor in Hamburg and vice-chancellor and is an old hand. The way they are dealing with this crisis and how they reshaped German foreign politics, I think, has been pretty good.Newsletter | Raj Kamal Jha: You talked about the history between Germany and Russia. Chancellor Merkel had strong ties…Can there be a back-channel…you make it seem Moscow revolves around one man.As we see the reactions of the nomenklatura in the Kremlin, they’re very focused on one person, it is pretty clear who calls the shots. The matter of the game is how do we make Putin stop. Through these diplomatic channels? If possible, yes. Whoever has an influence should do it. Or through social media, or through contradicting their false narratives, or through civil societies and sanctions. Whatever it takes, it’s necessary right now.By the way, you didn’t bring up the question of any kind of mistreatment of refugees, who have a different skin colour? I say that for the reason that it could be fake news, it could be a kind of a narrative. But there could also be cases like these. Our foreign minister said in the General Assembly, “If there are cases like these, we take them very seriously.” And we take them up with Ukrainians and the Ukranians have also said if there are such cases, we are taking them up. This is the difference between a democracy and an authoritarian regime like Russia. We are not putting this under the carpet. All the information we get, we take them seriously, and we try to find out what’s behind it.Shubhajit Roy: Germany has had relatively stable periods under long chancellor-ships. How do you see the trajectory of German politics ahead?There was always a kind of a lower-intensity crisis like the Brexit, refugee crisis, and the economic breakdown, the bubble which burst, and then, you had Afghanistan. These days, I think being in politics means crisis management, wherever you are. I think that the result of our elections last year also reflects the situation in the world, which at that time, without Putin, was more focused on climate change. That’s why the Green Party did very well. And that’s why we have this kind of rainbow coalition, which means in the future not only in Germany, but in many European countries, climate will be a very important topic.Shubhajit Roy: The India-German relationship in the last three years, you’ve seen it grow. What are the challenges that you faced in this relationship?I think the challenges are to know how to get crises like Ukraine and such things out of the way because we have to focus on the real things which matter — cooperation between the two countries, economic growth, getting jobs, working on renewable energies and technic transfer and getting the students to Europe. There are so many positive things which we have to focus on, you should not focus on the war. We have 2,000 companies here, we have six Goethe institutes, the highest number of Indian students in Europe are in Germany, they’re not in the UK. France has 8,000 and the UK has 25,000. Germany has 30,000 students. We could do more.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/03/IDEA-Walter-J-Lindner-LEAD-6col.jpg,"Ukrainian airport destroyed in Russian strike: Zelenskyy - Deccan Herald

"Bankers are abandoning Hong Kong as Beijing and COVID-19 remake the city - CNA
File photo of Hong Kong cityscape. (Photo: AFP/Philippe Lopez)In Hong Kong’s affluent mid-levels, in the subtropical foothills of Victoria Peak, the talk today among well-heeled expatriates inevitably turns to one subject: Who will be the next to leave.Down the mile-long escalator, in the skyscrapered central business district, the quiet exodus is gaining momentum. A few bankers at Citigroup. A few more at JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings.The numbers are small, but they’re adding up. A net 71,000 people from all walks of life left Hong Kong in February – a portent, many here worry, of worse to come.The hard truth about Hong Kong’s future is this: Lives and liberties are being altered forever by Beijing’s ever-tightening control. The city’s flailing response to the coronavirus - overwhelmed hospitals, bleak quarantine camps and now compulsory testing for all 7.4 million residents - has stirred anger and fear.More and more of the white-collar professionals who help shape Hong Kong’s identity and make this a place where business thrives are concluding the best days are over. New York, London, Singapore, Dubai – all now beckon instead.The death knell for Hong Kong has been sounded many times since Britain returned this city to China in 1997. But executives say this time it’s different, and more ominous. A quarter century of Beijing rule – a period punctuated by mass protests, the erosion of civil liberties, crackdowns on press freedom and more - has taken a toll on the city’s collective psyche. Two crushing years of the pandemic, with no immediate relief in sight, have left Hong Kong a city of perpetual crisis.The change is palpable. The AsiaWorld-Expo, a vast exhibition centre where Guns N’ Roses and Katy Perry have played, has been turned into a bed-filled quarantine facility. Restaurants are closing by the thousands and Lan Kwai Fong, the popular expat haunt for drinking and dining, resembles a ghost town.Schools are letting out months early so they can be used as venues for testing, isolation and vaccinations. The city is building tens of thousands of isolation units, suggesting zero-COVID is here to stay for the long haul. For the many that can’t pack up and go, the situation is dire as the omicron variant surges. The rocketing infections are hitting the poorer segments of the city hard - with people having to languish on gurneys in the cold and rain outside of overfilled hospitals or crammed in with sick relatives in Hong Kong’s famously small apartments. Expat professionals from Europe, the US and elsewhere only account for a tiny fraction of Hong Kong’s population. Their numbers and influence were declining even before the 1997 handover, as Hong Kong’s new business aristocracy – the mainland Chinese – have steadily risen to prominence.Official figures bear this out: New visas for foreign financial-service workers fell 49 per cent to 2,569 between 2018 and 2021, according to government data. Such visas issued to mainland Chinese rose eight per cent over the period, reaching 2,314 last year.   But even now, expats exert an outsize influence over the city’s cultural and economic life.Those working in finance help cement Hong Kong’s position as one of the world’s top five largest financial centres and a vibrant crossroads of East and West. So do teachers, artists, restaurateurs, academics and all the others who are now reconsidering their futures here too.Richard Heyes is among the doubters. A British national, Heyes has lived here for a decade, staying on even after he retired in 2020 from Citigroup, where he ran the Asia-Pacific equities business. But given all the uncertainties, he says he might stay in Europe for a prolonged time after traveling back to London to see his children.  “I can only see the opportunities diminishing for the expat community,’’ Heyes, 58, said.  Suzi Duncan has made her decision: Go. A British national who works at a major law firm, she recently left for Dubai after three years here. The final straw: Her fear that authorities would  if she were to test positive for COVID-19. “I was terrified,” Duncan, 34, said. Her blunt characterisation of the current state of affairs: “No light at the end of the tunnel.”  John Wood has quit Hong Kong too. A private-equity investor and self-described “road warrior,” he returned to the US in January after seven years in Hong Kong. He and his family ended up in government-mandated quarantine for 21 days after they returned from a vacation last year. That was enough.“I told myself, it’s the first time - and the last time,” Wood, 57, said.On Hollywood Road, home to trendy bars, art galleries and antique shops, Herve Pennequin, once named the world’s third best sommelier, is contemplating his future too. Pennequin thought he got a good deal on rent when he opened Bacchus Wine & Restaurant in February 2021. Business is now 50 per cent below his projections. Worse, he’s been separated from his 18-month-old son and family who live in the Philippines.   The 55-year-old, wearing a light-green Brooks Brothers jacket, a Hugo Boss polo shirt, Burberry glasses and a Rolex Daytona, said the city now lives under the “fear” officials have imposed.“If China keeps on pressuring Hong Kong to match what China has been doing, it’s difficult for the city to remain vibrant,” he said, whistling to suggest game over. “In the past six months, we’re dragged into it.”About 5,000 restaurants, or almost one third of Hong Kong’s eateries, are considering shutting down for months in order to cut costs, according to the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants and Related Trades. More than 1,200 restaurants have already suspended business and 300 have permanently closed.The government has proposed a relief package, but that is viewed as too little and too late. International financiers are reluctant to talk openly about their plans. Most are wary of angering the Beijing government, which holds the keys to lucrative business in the US$54 trillion mainland market.Privately, however, many say their frustrations are growing. Rising numbers of employees are asking to be relocated. Bosses say they’re trying to review the requests on a case-by-case basis to avoid drawing attention. Senior moves are particularly sensitive.No one wants to be perceived as turning their backs on China, which has demanded that Hong Kong hew to the mainland’s commands to stamp out the outbreak at any cost. At a recent town-hall for Asian employees, Societe Generale SA chief executive officer Frederic Oudea hinted at the difficult landscape banks have to navigate.Signalling a shift out of Hong Kong could be seen as an “aggressive step towards China,” which “may not help us to develop in the long run as we want in China,” he told staff in a wide ranging discussion in comments obtained by Bloomberg News. The French bank declined to comment further. Surveys by local business groups point to the road ahead. A poll last year by the Asia Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association found that almost half of all major international banks and asset management firms here were considering moving at least some employees or job functions out of Hong Kong.The European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong similarly warned that the city could face a major exodus. Many working in finance are waiting for annual bonuses to be paid or, for those with children, for school to let out before leaving, but with schools now letting out early the exodus is gathering pace.  At some banks, change is afoot. Citigroup is quietly moving a half a dozen equities bankers to Singapore and other markets.A similar number of managing directors at JPMorgan Chase has left over the past six months, some moving back to Europe for bigger jobs. At HSBC, James Grafton, co-head of Asia equity execution, moved to London recently to take on a global role. His spot in Hong Kong was filled by Oliver Kadhim, who relocated from London.A big shift is underway at Wells Fargo, which has reduced its workforce in Hong Kong to less than 500 from almost 800 in 2019, while building up in Singapore, Hong Kong’s regional rival, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the sensitive nature of the matter.Wells Fargo said it remains committed to Hong Kong.“Hong Kong continues to be an important market and location to us,” the bank said in a statement. “Suggestions we are moving our focus away from Hong Kong do not accurately reflect our commitment to this market.”Citigroup, too, said Hong Kong remains a vital outpost. Overall, the bank has added more than 300 people in Hong Kong over the past 12 months, a third of whom were recruited or transferred from overseas, Citigroup spokesman James Griffiths said.“The bank was being as flexible as possible to support staff who wanted to relocate due to family reasons or for client coverage,” Griffiths said last month. He declined to comment on specific personnel moves.London-based HSBC, whose history is deeply entwined with colonial Hong Kong but today is looking to mainland China for growth, has been eager to demonstrate its commitment.Last year it announced the relocation of one of its global co-heads of investment bank, as well as its heads of commercial banking and wealth, from London.Spokespeople for Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, HSBC and JPMorgan all declined to comment for this story.But as Hong Kong marks a quarter century under Chinese sovereignty – the halfway point in China’s halting promises to maintain the semi-autonomous city’s way of life for 50 years – the landscape keeps shifting. The rise of mainland Chinese financiers, as well as the relentless pull of Shanghai and Beijing, are challenging Hong Kong’s image as the ultimate crossroads of East and West. As its expats depart, Hong Kong begins to resemble what some always feared it might one day become: Another city in China.Allan Zeman, who owns large parts of Hong Kong’s fabled Lan Kwai Fong nightlife district, is deeply worried about the city he has called home since the 1970s. ""The international reputation of HK is now very damaged, and I worry that ‘One Country Two Systems’ as we know it will disappear,’’ he wrote in a letter to Chief Executive Carrie Lam, referring to the framework set up when the city was handed back to China in 1997. ""A lot of talent has already left. I don’t think this is what President Xi wants as China needs an international HK and not just another city of 7M people.""We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

"Russia announces ceasefire to allow Mariupol residents to evacuate - EWN
KYIV - The Ukrainian port city of Mariupol was to evacuate residents Saturday after invading Russian forces declared a temporary ceasefire to open a corridor for civilians to flee one of the war's fiercest battles.      Russia had blockaded the strategic city, which proudly resisted a siege by Moscow-backed rebels during a 2014 conflict only to find itself again a target, and cut off electricity, food, water and heating in the dead of winter.The evacuation will be seen as a prelude to a final assault by Russian forces that, if successful, would see their invading army pushing north from occupied Crimea link up with their force from the east and win control of Ukraine's coast on the Sea of Azov.After the Russian defence ministry declared a ceasefire to allow ""humanitarian corridors"" out of Mariupol and neighbouring Volnovakha, Mariupol officials announced on social media that the city's 450,000-strong population could begin to leave by private transport from 9am GMT.The siege of Mariupol came as more Russian forces inched closer to the capital Kyiv, encountering stiff resistance and shelling civilian areas in the western suburbs and the northern town of Chernihiv, where there have been heavy civilian casualties in recent days.A group AFP of reporters who visited the town on Saturday saw scenes of devastation, despite Moscow's insistence that it is not targeting civilian areas, and fears are rising in Kyiv that the capital will suffer the same fate once Russian missile artillery is deployed within range.Ukraine's defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov alleged that Russia had changed its tactics after encountering tough Ukrainian resistance that had defeated its apparent plan to quickly storm major cities and overthrow President Volodymyr Zelensky's government.""Yes, the enemy has advanced in some directions, but it controls only a small area. Our defenders are repelling and ousting the occupiers,"" he said, in a Facebook post.""The aggressor comprehensively and actively uses its air and missile potential. Aviation of all kinds bombards cities, towns and civilian infrastructure,"" he said, dubbing the Russian army ""cowardly"" and only able to attack ""children, women, unarmed civilians."" Since President Vladimir Putin's army invaded on 24 February, Russia has pummelled Ukrainian cities, killed hundreds of civilians and even assaulted Europe's largest atomic power plant, sparking fears of a catastrophic nuclear accident.Moscow has seized two key cities in its 10-day-long invasion, Berdiansk and Kherson on Ukraine's southern Black Sea coast.But capturing Mariupol would represent a bigger prize for Russian forces as it would deal a severe blow to Ukraine's maritime access and connect troops coming from annexed Crimea and the Donbas.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said late Friday that Moscow was waiting for a third round of talks with Ukraine in Belarus, and one of Kyiv's negotiators said it hoped to hold them this weekend.""The third leg could take place tomorrow or the day after, we are in constant contact,"" Ukrainian presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said Friday.In a hospital in the Ukrainian capital, wounded soldiers told AFP of their grim battle against the Russian advance and vowed to return to the frontline.""We were on reconnaissance and came across an enemy column that had made a breakthrough,"" said Motyka, 29, who was hit by shrapnel on his right side.""We fought them and killed their soldiers on foot, but they showered us with mortar fire.""Zelensky was to appeal to Washington for more assistance Saturday. He will address the US Senate as some lawmakers urged President Joe Biden to take tougher measures, including banning Russia's oil imports.NO NO-FLY ZONEZelensky had earlier criticised NATO for ruling out imposing a no-fly zone, saying the Western military alliance had essentially given ""the green light for further bombing of Ukrainian cities and villages"".With fears growing of direct conflict between Western forces and Russia, both nuclear armed, the US and Moscow have set up a new direct phone line to reduce the risks of ""miscalculation,"" the Pentagon said Friday.Russian forces attacked and seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant on Friday, pushing Kyiv to accuse Moscow of ""nuclear terror"".Ukrainian monitors say there has been no spike in radiation after a fire in a training facility. Moscow denied it had shelled the plant. MEDIA EXODUSIn an apparent response to the unrest, Russian authorities have imposed a news blackout and several media outlets have halted operations.Multiple media websites, including the BBC, were partially inaccessible in Russia. Twitter was restricted and Facebook blocked.The BBC and Bloomberg said they were suspending work in Russia after lawmakers in Moscow approved legislation to impose fines and jail terms of up to 15 years for anyone publishing ""fake news"" about the army.""This legislation appears to criminalise the process of independent journalism,"" BBC Director-General Tim Davie said in a statement.CNN said it would halt broadcasting in Russia, while independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said it would remove Ukraine content in the wake of the new law.'WHOLE WORLD AGAINST YOU'Putin has been unmoved as Russia has become isolated in the economic, sporting and cultural fields.But UN prosecutors at The Hague are investigating a possible war crime in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where authorities say residential areas were indiscriminately shelled.In Geneva, the UN Human Rights Council voted to create a top-level investigation into violations committed in the invasion.The UN says more than 1.2 million refugees have flooded into neighbouring countries.The global body's food agency has warned the conflict will create a food crisis in Ukraine and worsen global food insecurity, with Moscow and Kyiv providing around 29% of the global wheat trade.""The bullets and bombs in Ukraine could take the global hunger crisis to levels beyond anything we've seen before,"" said agency director David Beasley.

A South African TV news producer and her four crew have been evacuated from Ukraine after two of them were shot by a suspected Russian “death squad”.Dominique van Heerden, who works for Sky News, was in a car with her colleagues — including chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay — when they came under fire after unsuccessfully trying to visit the town of Bucha near Kyiv.Dramatic footage from Sky shows the attack. And posting on Instagram after returning to London, Van Heerden said: ""Not sure how we survived this - but we somehow did, and everyone is OK. We are home now but our minds are on Ukraine, everyone there, and those who have died."" The Guardian reported that Ramsay was shot in the lower back and camera operator Richie Mockler took two rounds in his body armour.Van Heerden's LinkedIn profile says she was born and raised in SA, and studied at Unisa, before moving to London in 2003.“Have covered breaking news and feature stories across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. Now a senior foreign producer at Sky News working with chief correspondent Stuart Ramsay.”Sky broadcast footage showing Van Heerden's crew approaching a junction when the car starts to be shot at.A woman's voice — thought to be Van Heerden's — can be heard shouting at the gunmen that the car contains “British journalists ... journalista”. A man's voice says: “Is everyone OK ... you OK Dom?” and she replies “Yeah, I'm OK.” Then the gunfire starts again, and Ramsay's voice-over says: “I'm hit but escape the car, and with producer Dominique van Heerden we make our way down the embankment.”Van Heerden, wearing a helmet and bulletproof vest, can then be seen with other crew members making their way to cover in a warehouse. “We can't believe we're alive,” says Ramsay.Initially, Ramsay said, they thought that it was a Ukrainian army checkpoint firing at them — and they can be heard shouting that they are journalists and asking for their attackers to stop.“I do recall wondering if my death was going to be painful,” Ramsay said, recounting the moments before he was shot. “But what amazed me was that [being shot] didn’t hurt that bad. It was more like being punched, really.”Eventually the group, also including producers Martin Vowles and Andrii Lytvynenko, were rescued by Ukrainian police three hours later. They were later told the gunmen were a saboteur Russian reconnaissance squad.“It was professional, the rounds kept smashing into the car — they didn’t miss,” Ramsay said.He added: “We were very lucky.

"Pope Francis: Ukraine humanitarian crisis 'growing dramatically' amid 'river of blood and tears' - Fox News
Fox News' Alex Hogan speaks to refugees on Polish border.""The need for humanitarian assistance in that troubled country is growing dramatically by the hour,"" Francis continued.  ""War is madness! Stop, please! Look at this cruelty!""Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities last month, Pope Francis made the extraordinary papal gesture of going to the Russian embassy in Rome to express his concern about the war.The pope's homily on Sunday continued his habit of refraining from publicly calling out Russia, presumably for fear of antagonizing the Russian Orthodox Church, with which he is trying to build stronger ties.
      Pope Francis holds his homily during a Mass on the Solemnity of the Epiphany at St. Peter's Basilica on Jan. 6, 2022, in Vatican City.
      The pope's exhortation echoed that of more than 280 Russian Orthodox clergy, who signed an open letter urging for an end to the ""fratricidal war"" in Ukraine, as of Sunday.""We mourn the ordeal to which our brothers and sisters in Ukraine were undeservedly subjected,"" the letter read, according to a translation in The Christian Post.
      Morning fog surrounds the thousand-year-old Monastery of the Caves, also known as Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, one of the holiest sites of Eastern Orthodox Christians, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.
      The clergy also lamented the divisions the ongoing conflict has torn open, writing, ""It saddens us to think of the gulf that our children and grandchildren in Russia and Ukraine will have to bridge in order to begin to be friends again, to respect and love each other.""""Stop the war,"" they urged.A 2018 survey found that about 67.3% of Ukraine's population identifies as some type of Orthodox Christianity, with 28.7% part of the Kyiv-based Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), 23.4% simply ""Orthodox,"" and 12.8% UOC-MP.The Associated Press and Fox News Digital's Tyler O'Neil contributed to this report.",https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/33429842-ba12-4c73-9afa-578ff999f689/6910daf6-940d-4d7c-8f0f-d25d20ab3391/1280x720/match/931/524/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,"Russia is recruiting Syrians to fight in Ukraine: report - Business Insider

    House Speaker Nancy PelosiNancy Pelosi    (D-Calif.) said in a letter Sunday that the House is exploring legislative options to isolate Russia, including a ban on Russian oil and energy. ""Our bill would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States, repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and take the first step to deny Russia access to the World Trade Organization,"" Pelosi said in a letter to colleagues. ""We would also empower the Executive branch to raise tariffs on Russian imports.""The House speaker noted that the Biden administration had requested $10 billion for ""humanitarian, military and economic support for Ukraine,"" and said ""Congress intends to enact this emergency funding this week as part of our omnibus government funding legislation.""Pelosi's letter comes after a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate earlier in the week to ban Russian oil imports. That measure was led by Sen.  (D-W.Va.), who chairs of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Sen.  (R-Alaska), a senior member of the committee. “The United States cannot continue to purchase millions of barrels of oil while Putin wages an unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine,” said Senate Majority Whip  (D-Ill.), who said on Saturday that he would support the bill.The billions in new funding for Ukraine would be part of omnibus spending plan. The Ukraine push adds even more pressure on Congress to wrap up work on government funding legislation in time for a March 11 deadline, after the cutoff date was previously pushed back several times to buy negotiators more time for spending talks.Though the Biden administration has been hesitant to target Russia's energy resources in its crippling sanctions on the country, the White House signaled on Friday that the president was considering steps to reduce U.S. imports of Russian oil.  Secretary of State  said earlier on Sunday that the U.S. was engaging in an “active discussion” about the possibility of banning Russian oil imports.“When it comes to oil, Russian oil, I was on the phone yesterday with president and other members of the Cabinet on exactly the subject. And we are now talking to our European partners and allies to look in a coordinated way at the prospect of banning the import of Russian oil while making sure that there is still an appropriate supply of oil on world markets,” Blinken said on CNN.On Thursday, White House press secretary Jen PsakiJen Psaki    told reporters that the U.S. does not “have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy and that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people around the world.”However, Pelosi voiced support of the move on Thursday when asked about a potential ban. “Ban the oil coming from Russia,"" she said. “I'm all for that — ban it.""The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2022  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.
