 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a 'Level One' Covid-19 notice for Americans travelling to India, saying the risk of contracting the infection and developing severe symptoms may be lower if one is fully vaccinated.The travel health notice has also been issued for Pakistan.However, the US State Department issued level two and three travel advisories for India and Pakistan, saying while citizens are urged to reconsider travel to Pakistan due to terrorism and sectarian violence, those going to India must exercise increased caution due to crime and terrorism.The CDC in its health travel notice 'Level One' said, ""Your risk of contracting Covid-19 and developing severe symptoms may be lower if you are fully vaccinated with an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) authorised vaccine.""In its advisory for India, the State Department urged US citizens not to travel to Jammu and Kashmir due to terrorism and civil unrest, and also within 10 kilometres of the India-Pakistan border due to the potential for armed conflict.ALSO READ: ""Indian authorities report rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. Violent crimes, such as sexual assault, has occurred at tourist sites and in other locations,"" it said.The department in its advisory for Pakistan urged US citizens not to travel to Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism and kidnapping, and also in the immediate vicinity of the Line of Control due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.""Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Pakistan. A local history of terrorism and ongoing ideological aspirations of violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as local military and police targets,"" it said.""Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship, and government facilities,"" it said.CommentsTerrorists have targeted US diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past, the advisory on Pakistan said.ALSO READ:Click here for IndiaToday.in’s ",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/../sites/all/themes/itg/images/itg_image88x50.jpg,"Russian anti-satellite missile test endangers space station crew, says NASA - The Indian Express
A missile Russia fired into one of its own satellites in a weapons test on Monday generated an orbital debris field that  and will pose an ongoing hazard to space activities “for years to come,” US officials said.The seven-member space station crew — four US astronauts, a German astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts — were directed to take shelter in their docked spaceship capsules for two hours after the test as a precaution to allow for a quick getaway had it been necessary, NASA said.The research lab, orbiting about 402 km above Earth, continued to pass through or near the debris cluster every 90 minutes, but NASA specialists determined it was safe for the crew to return to the station’s interior after the third pass, the agency said. The crew was also ordered to seal off hatches to several modules of the space station for the time being, according to NASA.“NASA will continue monitoring the debris in the coming days and beyond to ensure the safety of our crew in orbit,” NASA chief Bill Nelson said in the statement.Experts say the testing of weapons that shatter satellites in orbit pose a space hazard by creating clouds of fragments that can collide with other objects, setting off a chain reaction of projectiles through Earth orbit.Thousands of fragmentsThe Russian military and ministry of defense were not immediately available for comment. The direct-ascent anti-satellite missile fired by Russia generated more than 1,500 pieces of “trackable orbital debris” and would likely spawn hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments, the US Space Command said in a statement.“Russia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations,” space command chief US Army General James Dickinson said.The debris from the missile test “will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance maneuvers,” he said.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned the missile test as “reckless and irresponsible.”At the Pentagon, spokesman John Kirby said the test showed the need to firmly establish norms of behavior in space. “It is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts,” Nelson said. He said the cloud of debris also posed a threat to a separate Chinese space station under construction and the three-member crew of “taikonauts” aboard that outpost.The incident came just four days after the latest group of four space station astronauts — Americans Raja Chair, Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron of NASA and European Space Agency crewmate Matthias Maurer of Germany — arrived at the orbiting platform to begin a six-month science mission. They were welcomed by three space station crew members already on board — Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov and US astronaut Mark Vande Hei.The space station, spanning the size of an American football field end to end, has been continuously occupied since November 2000, operated by an international partnership of five space agencies from 15 countries, including Russia’s Roscosmos.Russia is not the first country to conduct anti-satellite tests in space. The United States performed the first in 1959, when satellites were rare and new. In April, Russia carried out another test of an anti-satellite missile as officials have said that space will increasingly become an important domain for warfare.In 2019, India shot down one of its own satellites in low-Earth orbit with a ground-to-space missile.The US military is increasingly dependent on satellites to determine what it does on the ground, guiding munitions with space-based lasers and satellites, as well as using such assets to monitor missile launches and track its forces. These tests have raised questions about the long-term sustainability of space operations essential to a huge range of commercial activities, including banking and GPS services.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/11/nasa_iss.jpg,"Singapore welcomes vaccinated travelers from India - Moneycontrol
Singapore is set to scrap quarantine requirements for fully-vaccinated Indians from November 29 under the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL). Singapore will begin accepting Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) applications from Indian travellers from November 22.Following discussions between PMs @NarendraModi and @LeeHsienLoong, will be launching a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) for fully-vac travellers frm w valid entry approvals - starting 29 Nov - pending resumption of commercial passenger. More on VTL @ https://t.co/ssCP8A7Gos https://t.co/om3Oe9egqLAccording to Singapore's travel guidelines, passengers from India can skip quarantine provided they submit proof of vaccination via an app like CoWin.Instead, they will be required to produce a negative pre-departure test taken within two days prior to departure and undergo an on-arrival PCR test, it said.Since November 12, India has started recognising vaccination certificates issued by Singapore.The Singapore health ministry has also updated its public health assessment and will upgrade India to Category 2 from November 19.COVID-19 VaccineA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.The Category 2 classification means that a country either has similar or lower COVID-19 incidence rates than Singapore and other VTL countries.Besides, travellers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will be able to enter Singapore from December 6, in a further expansion of the VTL scheme.Applications for short-term visitors and long-term pass holders will start on November 22 for travellers from India and Indonesia, while travellers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE will be able to apply from November 29.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"COP26 ends: Key takeaways from the biggest global climate summit so far - Moneycontrol.com
The COP26 Summit in Glasgow, as the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties held in the United Kingdom is known, has ended after two weeks. In what was one of the most followed yet contentious such meets till now, the Glasgow summit had sought stricter commitments from nations to check climate change, building on their pledges in Paris six years ago.The final outcome, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, reaffirms the devastating impact of an increase of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius in the global temperature on humanity and the planet. But the participants stumbled on the measures needed to reach the goal of containing the rise in temperature.Instead, the pact calls on 197 countries to report their progress towards more climate targets next year, at COP27, set to take place in the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. As a result, experts say that despite high ambitions, the text of the final agreement has barely managed to hold on to previous commitments. Senior United Nations officials have said this constitutes “the least worst outcome” as no country has left the summit fuming, nor happy.One of the iconic images of the summit was COP26 president and British cabinet minister Alok Sharma struggling to hold back tears following the adoption of the final agreement, which has been widely reported as a compromise deal. The Indian-origin minister had repeatedly warned that despite agreeing on the target, countries were struggling to reach them.Moneycontrol takes a look at the steps taken to move forward and hurdles that couldn't be scaled:Cutting carbon emissionsWhile in principle almost all countries have committed to reduce emissions, they could not agree on the key contributors towards emissions, oil and gas, and coal.While this was the first time the need to reduce the use of fossil fuels was explicitly mentioned in COP texts, both the developed world and least developed countries have been disappointed with the final agreement.The summit also managed to agree on other significant contentious issues on its agenda, including how countries report their emissions and rules for global carbon markets.Climate financeEven before delegates reached Glasgow, climate experts had stressed that the question of who will provide the promised $100 billion in annual climate finance and how would be the biggest issue at the summit. The Glasgow meet began with the stated intention by all parties to find out how much money should be committed.All nations now agree that upwards of $1 trillion—not the $100 billion estimated in 2008—would be required annually to help poorer nations mitigate and adapt to climate change-led extreme weather events.But as the richest economies could not come to an agreement of who will foot the bill and even when the assistance will begin flowing, the topic of climate finance has remained inconclusive. The deal, however, asks rich countries to “at least double” by 2025 the sums they give to developing counties to help them adapt to climate change from 2019 levels.This was pointed to by India and China during their opposition to the COP plan to phase out coal power. Sources say that both nations, backed by other developing countries like South Africa and Indonesia, had argued that they can't promise to phase out coal power in the absence of the promised finance required to invest in renewable energy.Much of the developing world remains nominally poor, under-industrialised and with a young population. Unlike their richer counterparts with older populations such as Japan, the UK and US, countries across Africa and Asia have said they need to be provided with financial assistance from those who have till now pumped in carbon into the atmosphere.National commitmentsThe Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) are non-binding national plans highlighting climate actions, including climate-related targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions, policies and measures to achieve the global targets set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Accord.The COP26 deal has promised to update the timeframe for revised targets for countries to the end of next year—much earlier than the requirement of every five years, as laid out in the Paris accord. Back then, India had pledged to improve the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, increase the share of non-fossil fuel-based electricity to 40 percent by 2030, and enhance its forest cover to absorb 2.5-3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2030.This has been updated at the Glasgow summit with India promising to increase installed renewable capacity to 500 GW, meet 50 percent of its energy requirements from non-fossil fuel sources, and bring down the carbon emissions intensity of the economy by 45 per cent from 2005 levels.Multinational effortsWidely considered to be the highlight in progress of this COP, major multilateral initiatives by large economic powers such as the UK, the European Union, China and the US have taken centre stage.Till now, there have been four major commitments. These include a global clean-coal initiative by 40 countries and scores of major businesses to end all investments in new coal power generation domestically and internationally, and a pledge by more than 100 countries to cut methane emissions by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/userphoto/14791.jpg,"UK raises terror threat level following taxi explosion - The Indian Express
The UK government on Monday increased the terror level to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. The decision followed a taxi explosion outside a hospital in England that killed a man.Russ Jackson, the head of Counterterrorism Policing in northwest England, said Sunday’s explosion at Liverpool Women’s Hospital was caused by “the ignition of an explosive device” that was brought into the vehicle by a passenger. The male passenger died in the explosion and fire that followed, and the taxi driver was injured.Police were investigating the motivation of the incident and if anyone else was involved.Home Secretary Priti Patel told reporters that the threat level increase came in the context of being the second terrorist incident in the space of a month. She did not elaborate.“Our security and intelligence services prevent all sorts of acts, day in, day out,” Patel said. “And of course, they understand the landscape, they see context, they see all sorts of things that keep our country safe and secure every single day and that work will continue.”Three men in their 20s were arrested elsewhere in the city under the Terrorism Act on Sunday, and a fourth was detained on Monday. All are believed to be “associates” of the dead passenger, police said.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was due to chair a meeting of the government’s COBRA crisis committee on Monday in response to the blast.Suspicions about a motive for the explosion have been aroused by the timing — just before 11 a.m. on Remembrance Sunday, the moment people across Britain hold services in memory of those killed in wars.Jackson said investigators had not found a link to remembrance events, “but it is a line of inquiry we are pursuing.”“Although the motivation for this incident is yet to be understood, given all the circumstances, it has been declared a terrorist incident,” he said at a press briefing.He said the passenger had been picked up by the cab a 10-minute drive away and asked to be taken to the hospital, where the explosion occurred. The driver, named locally as David Perry, managed to escape from the car. He was treated in hospital and released.Police said officers had searched two addresses in the city linked to the passenger, and found “significant items” at one of them,
Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson said the taxi driver locked the doors of his cab so the passenger couldn’t leave. Police did not confirm that account.“The taxi driver, in his heroic efforts, has managed to divert what could have been an absolutely awful disaster at the hospital,” Anderson told the BBC.The prime minister also said the driver appeared to have behaved “with incredible presence of mind and bravery.”Nick Aldworth, a former senior terrorism investigator in Britain, said the taxi appeared to have sustained “a lot of fire damage with very little blast damage.”He said that “whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn’t work properly, or possibly an incendiary. So I think it’s very much open to debate at the moment about what has happened.”",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/11/Liverpool-blast.jpg

"Police name dead suspect in Liverpool blast as UK raises terror threat level - Eyewitness News
LIVERPOOL - Britain raised its terrorism threat level Monday, hours after an improvised explosion outside a hospital in Liverpool, as police named the suspect believed to have made the homemade device before dying in the blast.Interior minister Priti Patel said intelligence officials had increased the threat assessment to ""severe"" - the second-highest level, meaning an attack is highly likely - following the second terror incident in a month. Last month, veteran British MP David Amess was stabbed to death as he met constituents in southeast England, in an attack that prosecutors have said had a ""terrorist connection"".The blast outside the Liverpool Women's Hospital shortly before 1100 GMT on Remembrance Sunday destroyed a taxi and killed the passenger suspected of making the crude device, but only injured the driver. Police in northwest England said within hours that the blast was being treated as a ""terrorist incident"" and on Monday evening named the deceased suspect. ""Our enquiries are very much ongoing but at this stage we strongly believe that the deceased is 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen,"" senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Meeks said in a statement.He gave few other details, but noted Al Swealmeen was connected to two addresses police raided following the incident, living at one while recently renting another where officers have recovered ""significant items"".""We continue to appeal for any information about this incident and, now that we have released his name, any information that the public may have about Al Swealmeen, no matter how small, may be of great assistance to us,"" Meeks said. CONTROLLED EXPLOSIONPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the latest attack was a ""stark reminder of the need for us all to remain utterly vigilant"".""But what yesterday showed us all is that the British people will never be cowed by terrorism. We will never give in to those who seek to divide us with senseless acts,"" Johnson said.Earlier Monday, Russ Jackson, in charge of counter-terrorism policing in northwest England, said the motive for the attack was unclear. He confirmed the device which ignited and turned the taxi into a fireball was built by Al Swealmeen after he was picked up in the Kensington neighbourhood of the city.The explosion came just minutes before the Remembrance Sunday service at nearby Liverpool Cathedral, prompting speculation the event was the intended target.""We cannot at this time draw any connection with this, but it is a line of inquiry which we are pursuing,"" said Jackson.Three men aged 21, 26 and 29 were arrested under anti-terrorism laws in the nearby Kensington area soon after the explosion and remain in custody for questioning.A fourth man, aged 20, was detained earlier Monday, Jackson said, adding that ""significant items"" had been found at a second address in Sefton Park, near Kensington.On Monday afternoon, investigating officers carried out a controlled explosion ""as a precaution"" in Sefton Park.REMARKABLE ESCAPEThe blast and fireball sent thick smoke into the air as Britain was about to fall silent in tribute to its war dead and military veterans.There was prompt praise for the taxi driver, named locally as David Perry, following reports he locked the male passenger inside the cab after growing suspicious about his intentions.He was treated in hospital but released Monday, according to his wife, who posted on Facebook that it was ""an utter miracle"" he survived.""There are a lot of rumours flying round about him being a hero and locking the passenger inside the car... but the truth of the matter is, he is without a doubt lucky to be alive,"" she wrote.Johnson, who convened a government emergencies and contingencies meeting in response, said it appeared the driver ""did behave with incredible presence of mind and bravery"".'SUBSTANTIAL' THREATSome 2,000 people attended the religious service of remembrance, one of the biggest outside London, and a military parade, according to the Liverpool Echo newspaper.The scene at the hospital remained cordoned off on Monday, as did the streets around the two properties under investigation, where forensics officers in white suits were seen.Britain had downgraded its terrorism threat level from ""severe"" to ""substantial"" in February. It had been raised last November after a deadly shooting rampage in Vienna and several attacks in France. All were blamed on Islamist extremists.Meanwhile, Ali Harbi Ali, the 25-year-old accused of murdering David Amess last month as he met constituents in Leigh-on-Sea, east of the capital, will go on trial next year.Prosecutors have said the murder ""has a terrorist connection"" with ""religious and ideological motivations"".

VIENNA - Austria on Monday became the first country in the European Union to impose a lockdown on the unvaccinated and start inoculating children as young as five after coronavirus cases surged across the continent.Infection rates have surged, placing Western Europe once again at the heart of the global epidemic and governments are being forced to take action, with the Netherlands already announcing the region's first partial lockdown of the winter.Austria has inoculated about 65% of its nine million people, below the EU average of 67%.Latvia, which is also lagging behind on vaccination, similarly brought in tougher curbs for people who are not inoculated on Monday which will mean companies can dismiss employees who refuse the vaccine.Meanwhile, France has re-introduced mandatory mask-wearing and toughened entry requirements from a raft of countries, while a draft German law seen by AFP would re-introduce widespread home working.Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told AFP in a telephone interview that the ""threat scenario"" created by the controversial lockdown was already ""having an effect"", as more people come forward to get vaccinated.Over the past seven days, 128,813 people have received their first dose, up by more than 50,000 from the previous week.Daily new infection rates in Austria have been hovering at around 12,000 in recent weeks, up from roughly 2,000 a day in September.But the restrictions on the unvaccinated have fuelled accusations that Austria is cementing a ""two-class system,"" said Nikolaus Unterguggenberger, a 57-year-old teacher from Carinthia province, whose family is not vaccinated.""Our freedoms are being taken away from us,"" he told AFP, adding that the measure was illegal and that he would continue to go out and meet friends.Hundreds also gathered in Vienna on Sunday to protest.""It's time that more people spoke up,"" Sabine, a 49-year-old energy consultant, told AFP at the rally, calling the move ""discrimination"".Schallenberg rejected such criticism, insisting the government had ""not taken this step lightly"".""When one part of the population is taking the necessary steps to protect itself and others, and another part of the population isn't... taking measures to separate those two parts and reduce contacts is not discrimination,"" Schallenberg said.'THEY WILL BE PROTECTED'As part of efforts to increase vaccination coverage, Vienna city authorities have also become the first in the EU to start inoculating children between the ages of five and 11.Cartoons of ninja turtles and tigers adorned coronavirus vaccination booths on Monday to welcome children at a convention complex serving as a vaccine centre.One of the first to step in was eight-year-old Pia Schwarzl.Her father, 41-year-old Gerald Schwarzl, told AFP he had decided to have Pia and her five-year-old brother Theo vaccinated so that they ""don't get seriously sick"".""We believe they will be protected just like they are with other vaccinations,"" he said.The city authorities said some 10,000 appointments had been made for children over the weekend.They have decided to act even though the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved any of the coronavirus vaccines for the five-to-11 age bracket.'WANT EVERYONE TO FEEL SAFE'Austria hopes these measures can stem the virus and take the pressure off struggling intensive care units.The interior ministry has promised extra patrols to implement the lockdown, widely criticised as unenforceable and unlikely on its own to reduce contacts.At one of Vienna's famous Christmas markets, stallholders were hoping the new measures would prevent a repeat of last year when the markets were closed to combat the second wave.Daniel Stocker, the manager of the market in front of the capital's City Hall, said people were ""willingly"" complying with the requirement to have either been vaccinated or recovered from the virus.""We want everyone to feel safe,"" he says.

NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW ITBritain has accused Belarus’s authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko of an ‘abhorrent’ attempt to engineer a migrant crisis in an effort to undermine European unity.Boris Johnson criticised the ‘contrived crisis’ and insisted the UK stands ‘shoulder-to-shoulder’ with its European allies as EU foreign ministers considered fresh sanctions against the regime in Minsk.Thousands of migrants, mainly from the Middle East, are trapped on the Belarus border with Poland, where the authorities are refusing to allow them to enter the EU.Brussels has accused Mr Lukashenko – a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin – of deliberately encouraging the migrants to breach its borders in retaliation for sanctions the EU has imposed in response to his repressive rule.The Ministry of Defence announced on Friday that it was sending a small contingent of UK armed forces personnel to Poland to provide engineering support at the border.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘With reference to Poland, what we are seeing are the latest in a series of abhorrent attempts by the Lukashenko regime to engineer a migrant crisis to undermine Poland and others in the region.‘We stand in solidarity with our European partners and our commitment is to ensuring the Lukashenko regime is held accountable for its actions.’EU foreign ministers are now expected to expand sanctions against Belarus to include airlines, travel agents and individuals alleged to be helping to entice migrants to Europe in what is being described as a ‘hybrid attack’ on the bloc.It follows a call by Foreign Secretary Liz Truss to Mr Putin to intervene to halt what she called the ‘shameful manufactured migrant crisis’ unfolding in the region.The Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Carter, expressed concern that the situation could quickly escalate into something more serious.He told the BBC: ‘I think this is a classic case of the sort of hybrid playbook where you link disinformation to destabilisation and the idea of pushing migrants on to the European Union’s borders is a classic example of that sort of thing.’Meanwhile, Downing Street has also voiced concern about the build-up of Russian forces on Russia’s border with Ukraine.The Kremlin has dismissed claims that it is preparing to invade, after the Ukrainian defence ministry reported that around 90,000 Russian troops were massing in the area.However, Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: ‘We are seeing a concerning situation at the border. We remain in unwavering support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and will continue to support them in face of Russian hostility.’Later, the Prime Minister urged allies to ‘work ever more closely with those who do share our values and instincts’, as he issued a warning over European reliance on Russian gas through the Nord Stream 2 supply line.He was expected to tell business leaders, diplomats and dignitaries at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London: ‘So when we say that we support the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine, that is not because we want to be adversarial to Russia, or that we want in some way strategically to encircle or undermine that great country.‘And when our Polish friends asked for our help to deal with a contrived crisis on their border with Belarus, we were quick to respond.‘And we hope that our friends may recognise that a choice is shortly coming between mainlining ever more Russian hydrocarbons in giant new pipelines and sticking up for Ukraine and championing the cause of peace and stability, let me put it that way.’Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ‘The debris resulting from this test will remain in orbit, putting satellites and human spaceflight at risk for years to come.’Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.For more stories like this, check our news page.Not convinced?

Austria entered a lockdown for people not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus on Monday, with reinforced police checks to ensure compliance as the country struggles with a surge of Covid-19 cases.The government said that around two million people in the nation of roughly nine million are now only allowed to leave home for a limited number of reasons such as travelling to work or shopping for essentials.The aim is to counter a surge in infections to record levels fuelled by a full vaccination rate of only around 65% of the population, one of the lowest in western Europe.Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg announced the move at a news conference on Sunday as the country faces growing strain on its intensive care units. “We are not taking this step lightly but it is necessary,” Mr Schallenberg said of the new restrictions.“In reality we have told one third of the population: you will not leave your apartment anymore apart from for certain reasons. That is a massive reduction in contacts between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated,” Mr Schallenberg said.Many Austrians are sceptical about vaccines, a view encouraged by the far-right Freedom Party, the third biggest in parliament.The leader of opposition party, Herbert Kickl, vowed to combat the new restrictions by all available parliamentary and legal means. He said in a statement that “2 million people are being practically imprisoned without having done anything wrong.”Hours later, Mr Kickl announced on Facebook that he had tested positive for Covid-19 and must self-isolate for 14 days, meaning he will not be able to attend a protest in Vienna planned for Saturday.Austria has one of the highest coronavirus infection rates in Europe with 815 per 100,000 people infected. Germany is also discussing tightening restrictions and has already classified Austria as a high risk area meaning people arriving from there will have to go into quarantine - a blow to Austria’s winter tourism industry which is recovering from the pandemic still. Elsewhere in Europe, the number of Covid-19 patients in Dutch hospitals increased to around 2,000 on Monday, including almost 400 in intensive care, reaching the highest level since May.The new Austrian measures will last for 10 days and will not apply to children under 12-years-old or people who have recently recovered from coronavirus, health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said. Those under the measures will be banned from hotels, restaurants, theatres and ski lifts in the new restrictions which will be some of the strictest in Europe.Many officials, including in Mr Schallenberg’s conservative party and the police, have expressed doubts this lockdown can be properly enforced as it applies to only part of the population. Interior minister Karl Nehammer said there will be thorough police checks. Yet there are widespread doubts, including among Schallenberg’s conservatives and the police, about whether this lockdown can be properly enforced.It can be hard to verify, for example, whether an unvaccinated person is on their way to work, which is allowed, or going to shop for non-essential items, which is not.Targeted measures have recently been introduced in Australia, where 83 per cent of people aged 16-year-old and above have been fully inoculated. Some states have mandated vaccinations for some occupations and barred the unvaccinated from activities such as dining out, leading to demonstrations.Singapore, where 85 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated, has said those who remained unvaccinated by choice would have to foot their medical bills from next month.Austrian police officer checks cars during first day of lockdown for the unvaccinatedWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
