"2022 NFL Scouting Combine Day 4 takeaways: Lewis Cine makes claim to be first-round pick, cornerbacks cruise - CBS Sports
The 2022 NFL Scouting Combine came to an end Sunday with the defensive backs and special teams on the field. Attention turns to NFL visits and pro days as the 2022 NFL Draft quickly approaches.Here are some of our takeaways from Sunday's action:Baylor's Kalon Barnes (4.23 seconds) and Texas-San Antonio's Tariq Woolen (4.26 seconds) ran the two fastest times ever by a defensive back at the combine. Barnes' time was the second fastest of any position behind John Ross' 4.21 seconds 40-yard dash. Woolen also had a 42 inch vertical jump, which led all defensive backs.¬†For a closer look at Barnes' day as well as the fastest 40 time at every combine, ..@BUFootball CB Kalon Barnes was just .01 shy of John Ross' Combine record of 4.22. ü§Ø @KaayBarnes_ üì∫: #NFLCombine on @nflnetwork With LSU's Derek Stingley Jr. opting not to perform, it offered an opportunity for others to assert their claim as the top cornerback eligible for the 2022 NFL Draft. Washington's Trent McDuffie looked fluid during on-field drills. Cincinnati's Ahmad Gardner had his 40-yard dash time adjusted to 4.41 seconds officially, which is fantastic for a prospect who measured in at 6-foot-3.¬†Gardner and McDuffie are often the two prospects mentioned as being in the same stratosphere as Stingley. Stingley's absence may have opened the door for some change in the pecking order.¬†Notre Dame's Kyle Hamilton has been regarded as the top safety in the class, but there were concerns about the talent that would be available at that position beyond him. A few prospects responded to that criticism in a big way. Georgia safety Lewis Cine tested off the charts with a 4.38 seconds 40-yard dash, 36.5 inch vertical jump and 11-foot-1-inch broad jump. Michigan's Daxton Hill ran a 4.43 seconds 40-yard dash as well. A former 5-star recruit, Hill adds depth to the top end of this safety class.¬†Penn State's Jaquan Brisker performed admirably as well. Odds are good that one of those three players will be the second safety off the board.¬†San Diego State punter/kicker Matt Araiza is regarded as a versatile and dynamic prospect. He certainly showed how strong his leg is at the combine.¬†.@AztecFB punter @matt_araiza is booming nearly 80 yard punts out here.Look where the ball stops. üëÄüì∫: #NFLCombine continues at 2pm ET on @nflnetwork Three players -- Georgia punter Jake Camarda, Penn State punter Jordan Stout and Araiza -- ran under a 4.70 seconds 40-yard dash. Camarda led the pack at 4.56 seconds.Tom Izzo üêê Thank you for watching our coverage of the 2022 NFL combine! We will have more analysis coming from the last 4 days in Indianapolis.¬†Heard from multiple teams that Georgia‚Äôs Lewis Cine blew them away in interviews. Is he first safety off the board now after running 4.37 and jumping 11-1? There were some teams that had first round grades on him before doing all that.Cine also looking silky smooth through the drills.We have probably a half an hour or less in this year's NFL Combine.In addition to a 4.26 second 40-yard dash, UTSA cornerback Tariq Woolen also had a 42 inch vertical jump.Georgia's Lewis Cine with a 4.38u seconds 40-yard dash, 36.5 inch vertical jump and 11-foot-1-inch broad jump.¬† Stock UP.Daxton Hill with a 4.43u is very impressive.Toledo's Tycen Anderson is a lengthy safety that could be an option looking for a Kyle Hamilton-type player on Day 3. Florida A&M DB Markquese Bell's 4.45 speed shows up on tape. He plays a lot in the box.We are waiting for the safeties to get rolling here.Washington's Trent McDuffie is someone that has looked really smooth through drills today. He is often talked about as that third cornerback behind Ahmad Gardner and Derek Stingley Jr. but zone-heavy teams are going to be drawn to him.¬†Derion Kendrick, a Clemson transfer that played against the Tigers in the first game of the season. He ends up winning¬†a national championship with the Bulldogs.It's been awesome getting DeAngelo Hall's take on these drills. He's done a great job articulating what he is looking for in this drill.Official 40-yard dash times:Kalon Barnes (Baylor): 4.23 secondsTariq Woolen (UTSA): 4.26 secondsThose are the fastest times ever by a defensive back but falls short of John Ross' all-time combine record of 4.21.Some official 40-yard dash updates for cornerbacks:- Kalon Barnes 4.23- Tariq Woolen 4.26- Decobie Durant 4.38- Jalyn Armour-Davis 4.39- Kaiir Elam 4.39- Ahmad Gardner 4.41Notre Dame's Kyle Hamilton broad jumped 10-feet-11-inches, which is nuts. Tied for 30th all-time among safeties.Daniel Jeremiah making a great point that Roger McCreary plays at his top speed. It is great running the 40-yard dash fast but if that does not translate to the field, then who cares? McCreary is not a burner but he plays like it.¬†Really nice rep from Washington's Kyler Gordon. He kept his hips low, opened those hips easily but tight, found the football in the air and completed the play.Kentucky safety Yusuf Corker led all defensive backs with 23 reps on the bench press. Penn State safety Jaquan Brisker and Oklahoma State safety Kolby Harvell-Peel were the only others to top 20.Ahmad Gardner is regarded as a possible top 10 pick but it was actually his teammate, Coby Bryant, that won college football's Thorpe Award given to the best defensive back.Tariq Woolen is the only guy that I thought would challenge Kalon Barnes' time today. His second unofficial attempt was 4.304.55 from Auburn's Roger McCreary. He is not a burner and no one expected him to be. Where he falls short in speed, he makes up for in confidence, competitive toughness, versatility and resilience. He may not be an All-Pro type guy but McCreary is someone that you can draft and feel confident in what you get for a decade.¬†Ahmad Gardner improves his time with a 4.47u. It's not a WOW time that is going to force people to go back and re-evaluate his position amongst the top cornerbacks.Baylor's Kalon Barnes re-takes the crown as fastest of the day with a 4.29.4.31 for Tariq Woolen. He was moving.¬†4.41 would be a fantastic time for Alontae Taylor.4.57 for Kyler Gordon is disappointing if it holds. I expected him to be in the 4.3s, if not higher.Strange run from Ahmad Gardner. 4.52 is a solid time but it really looked like he was grinding. Never looked comfortable.The CBSSports DB rankings:LSU cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. (2)Notre Dame safety Kyle Hamilton (3)Cincinnati cornerback Ahmad Gardner (12)Clemson cornerback Andrew Booth Jr. (14)Auburn cornerback Roger McCreary (16)Michigan safety Daxton Hill (24)Florida cornerback Kaiir Elam (26)Washington cornerback Trent McDuffie (32)https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/prospect-rankings/Kaiir Elam is considered a bigger corner so 4.47u is a good time for him.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"As NFL scouting combine winds down, all eyes are on Aaron Rodgers and an important deadline - Yahoo Sports
INDIANAPOLIS ‚Äî When it comes to , the last day at the NFL scouting combine was illuminating on two points.First, it appears only Rodgers knows what he‚Äôs doing.Second, Tuesday‚Äôs franchise tag deadline at 4 p.m. ET for wideout Davante Adams is going to be a significant moment, tipping precisely how committed the Green Bay Packers are in laying a foundation for Rodgers‚Äô return. Most especially if Rodgers hasn‚Äôt informed the team of his decision by the tagging deadline, arguably showcasing to the quarterback that Green Bay is willing to make a major hope-based decision to keep him before he has made his commitment.Regardless of how that unfolds, what became clear over the past week is that nobody has a firm grasp on what Rodgers has been planning. That includes franchises interested in pursuing him if he seeks a trade, executives tasked with constructing trade offers and contract extensions, players impacted by Rodgers‚Äô decision, and even some associates who have previously been in the quarterback‚Äôs circle. The assessment from that wide array of parties is that through Sunday, Rodgers hadn‚Äôt showcased a lean to anyone. Whether he‚Äôs preparing for a departure from Green Bay, a trade elsewhere or a retirement that nobody seems to expect, the  has kept his process remarkably under wraps. So much so that one source deeply invested in the outcome of the decision described his approach heading into next week as ‚Äújust let it happen.‚ÄùThat source isn‚Äôt alone, either. Indeed, if there was a bottom line for all the franchises speculated to be involved, the simplest way to describe it is this: Neither the Packers nor Denver Broncos have any clue what Rodgers is going to do, and the Tennessee Titans and Pittsburgh Steelers are privately saying they do not have trade packages or contract extensions cooked up for a pursuit of Rodgers.Even as opaque as the situation is, there is a shared belief between all four of those teams that Rodgers‚Äô decision is going to come down to Green Bay and Denver, and that when it‚Äôs all over, he‚Äôs likely to sign a two-year contract extension making him the highest-paid player in the NFL.Now everyone is waiting for Tuesday‚Äôs franchise tag ‚Äútell‚Äù to materialize with the Packers and Adams, which will showcase Green Bay‚Äôs intent to keep Rodgers‚Äô top target in the fold for 2022. And while some in the media have suggested it could be a tag-and-trade move allowing the Packers to deal both Rodgers and Adams together, one executive not in play for either player was incredulous about that scenario.‚ÄúSending players and [draft] picks ‚Äî whoever is getting [Rodgers and Adams] together would have to be sending both players and picks ‚Äî that would be one of the biggest trades in NFL history or close to it,‚Äù the executive said. ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs the [contract] extensions, which Rodgers is probably the highest-paid player in the NFL next [season] and Davante Adams is going to be the richest total wide receiver deal ever done. Trading and paying the back-to-back MVP is hard enough and [media] are throwing in probably the best or second-best receiver in like it‚Äôs fantasy football.‚ÄùThat doesn‚Äôt mean such a move is impossible, of course. Every trade or asset burn is unprecedented until someone engineers it (see the Los Angeles Rams), but the reality is the path to keeping Rodgers and Adams together continues to make the most sense for Green Bay. If that doesn‚Äôt come together, the first step would be a decision from Rodgers, who could be traded and work out a new deal with a team after the new league year begins at 4 p.m. ET on March 16. If Rodgers requests a trade, the Packers would still have options with Adams, including a contract extension, trading him alone to another team, the aforementioned mega trade, letting him play out a tagged season, or rescinding the tag altogether and letting him depart in free agency.However it breaks down, this week represents the traction moment for everyone involved. Packers free agents are set to make decisions, Adams' future will have some clarity, and any teams interested in trading for Rodgers will be willing to back-burner their secondary options at quarterback for only so long. One way or another, this is going to come to a head. Rodgers also makes his weekly guest appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Tuesday, which suddenly seems like the perfect opportunity for everything to be revealed at once.That means Rodgers will own the news cycle for at least the next few days. Whether that stretches on for weeks or even the rest of the offseason has everything to do with his decision. If he stays, the band gets back together as much as the Packers can make that happen. If he leaves, it will have an NFL domino effect that we‚Äôll be talking about all the way into training camps in July.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png
"U.S. oil prices soar Sunday, briefly punching above $130 as talk of Russia oil embargo heats up - MarketWatch
Values for U.S. oil soared Sunday evening, driving prices above $125 a barrel in electronic trade as discussions about a ban on Russian oil heated up. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the U.S. was considering an embargo of Russian oil imports ‚Äúin coordination‚Äù with European and NATO allies in response to Moscow‚Äôs unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúState of the Union,‚Äù Blinken said the White House is reviewing the prospect of banning Russian oil imports, in coordination with European allies, while attempting to mitigate the impact of any such ban on global supplies, which could drive already-lofty prices further higher. Also read: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen the ruble in free fall. We see the economy heading into a deep recession. We‚Äôve already had a major impact, but we are looking, again, as we speak, in coordination with allies and partners at this prospect of banning oil imports,‚Äù he told NBC News. Russia is one of the biggest producers of crude oil, and sanctions its oil are viewed as holding the possibility of rippling through markets. That said, there has already been an implicit ban of Russian crude, with prospective buyers shunning crude out of Russia. Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a Thursday report, noted that Russian oil is facing an de facto embargo as the U.S. and its allies have imposed tough sanctions on major Russian banks, blocking them from the crucial SWIFT interbank messaging service for Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The sanctions avoided crude sanctions amid rising inflation being faced by the U.S. and much of the world but momentum around enacting an energy ban is building, as Western nations aim to curb the Kremlin‚Äôs military campaign in Ukraine and cripple it financially. Croft said that Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúalready staggering‚Äù export losses could hit 3 million to 4 million barrels a day if Western powers follow through and impose the sort of energy-focused ‚Äúsecondary sanctions‚Äù that were aimed at Iran.Read more: Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported on Sunday that ¬†for all regions, hiking its Arab Light crude for next month‚Äôs shipments to Asia to $4.95 a barrel above the benchmark it uses.Doubts about achieving a nuclear disarmament agreement between Iran and world powers also was helping to push prices of crude higher, Reuters reported, with doubts mounting that such a deal, which could see Tehran pour fresh supply onto the market, could be reached soon.

"Covid-positive deer may be harboring the virus and infecting humans, study says - Salon
Aside from saving human lives in the immediate moment, the other fundamental reason that public health officials were pushing mass vaccination to slow the spread of COVID-19 is because the more hosts in which a virus resides, the more likely the virus is to eventually mutate into something more virulent. Obviously, that has happened at least twice so far with SARS-CoV-2: first with the ultra-contagious delta variant, and then later with the .¬†Currently, the number of human hosts in the U.S. is waning as the . If we are lucky, that may imply that this wave of infections is over, and while the coronavirus will continue to circulate (and mutate) as it becomes endemic, it would have fewer hosts in which to do so.¬†Or, at least¬†human¬†hosts. As we know, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have circulated in bats and pangolins before crossing over to humans. We also know that the virus spread back into animals, presumably through humans: dogs,¬†cats, a zoo lion, and appear to have been infected by humans.Ominously, the infection trend may now be going the other way.¬†A¬†recent Canadian study¬†raises the possibility that deer ‚Äî one of the most ubiquitous large mammals in North America ‚Äî may have infected humans with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. That would imply the virus circulated for a while in deer, reproducing and occasionally mutating on its way, before jumping back into people.RELATED:¬†The new study provides evidence that deer may have infected humans, although it is not definitively proven. Conducted by more than two dozen scientists across Ontario and posted on the database bioRxiv (it has not yet been peer reviewed), the study included 300 samples from white-tailed deer in Canada during the final months of 2021. Seventeen of those deer tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all of them from southwestern Ontario. The scientists discovered that this same strain of SARS-CoV-2, which is highly divergent from other known strains, was also highly similar to a SARS-CoV-2 virus that had infected a human. (It was also closely related to a strain found among humans in Michigan in late 2020.) While the scientists cannot confirm that the virus had been transmitted to the human by a deer, they know that the human lived in the same geographic area as deer and had been in close contact with deer during the same time when the infected samples were collected.That said, the sample size is very small and no one has definitively proved that the deer gave the virus to the human. There is also no evidence that the person with the mutant SARS-CoV-2 virus passed it on to anyone else, and initial experiments suggests the new virus would not be able to evade antibodies. In other words, if it did spread among people, individuals who are vaccinated would likely be safe.Finally, because the deer-based SARS-CoV-2 virus is such an unknown, there is no reason to believe yet that it presents any kind of increased risk to humans. The bigger concern is that, because viruses can evolve in animals, there is the possibility that it could turn into something more dangerous.""The virus is evolving in deer and diverging in deer away from what we are clearly seeing evolving in humans,"" Samira Mubareka, a virologist at Sunnybrook Research Institute and the University of Toronto and an author of the new paper, told The New York Times. After fully sequencing the genomes from five of the infected deer, the scientists discovered many mutations that had not been previously documented. They also found 76 mutations that set the new version of SARS-CoV-2 from the original version of the virus. Some of those mutations had been previously discovered in other infected animals like mink.Shortly before this study was published, a separate group of scientists announced that Pennsylvania deer may have continued to be infected with the Alpha variant even after it disappeared in humans ‚Äî and that it evolved within them as they continued to spread it. This further reinforces the concern about deer incubating SARS-CoV-2 viruses.The SARS-CoV-2 virus is believed to have originated in in a horseshoe bat. At some point, the virus is thought to have been transmitted to another animal through one or many ""spillover events,"" and then eventually found its way to a human host. Bats are notorious for serving as hosts to dangerous coronaviruses because their immune systems are unusually aggressive. This means that viruses which live in bats need to evolve and replicate more quickly in order to survive.""The bottom line is that bats are potentially special when it comes to hosting viruses,"" Mike Boots, a disease ecologist and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology, told Science Daily in 2020. ""It is not random that a lot of these viruses are coming from bats. Bats are not even that closely related to us, so we would not expect them to host many human viruses. But this work demonstrates how bat immune systems could drive the virulence that overcomes this.""For more on animals and COVID-19, please read:Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer for Salon.

Look at the dates: 1890-1918; 1878-1918; 1896-1918; 1917-1918 ... Every person buried on this snowy slope in Barre, Vt, died within days, weeks of each other. ""It's pretty humbling,"" said Brian Zecchinelli.Nearly 200 died that Fall during that other pandemic, the 1918 so-called Spanish Flu. Zecchinelli and his wife, Karen, own the nearby Wayside Restaurant now. It's become a Vermont institution. ""Effie Ballou opened the Wayside in July of 1918, and two months later the pandemic hits Barre,"" he said. Zecchinelli has never stopped thinking about how little he knew about the 1918 flu ‚Äì and the fact that the grandfather he never met was one of its victims. He died at 35, on October 10 of that terrible year. Germinio Zecchinelli, like so many other Italian stone cutters, had moved to Barre to quarry granite, to carve the nation's gravestones (and often each others', as it turned out).""The Spanish Flu is often referred to as the 'forgotten flu,'"" Zecchinelli told correspondent Martha Teichner. ""And if we had anything to do with it, it wasn't gonna be forgotten, Germinio and all the others. We wanted to do something to memorialize him and the 50 million others worldwide that died.""Because, to his astonishment, there was no substantial monument ‚Äì anywhere ‚Äì in spite of the staggering number of dead. The forgotten pandemic, indeed. So, in 2018, a century after the fact, Zecchinelli commissioned this one. ""It is unbelievable that nothing else had been done,"" he said.""Six-hundred-seventy-five thousand Americans died in that pandemic. We're at nearly a million and counting dead from COVID.¬† Has history taught us anything?Tulane University scholar John Barry, who wrote the definitive history of the 1918 flu, ""The Great Influenza,"" said, ""This time around it confirmed the lesson from 1918: you tell the truth.""You heard things like - this is all about the 1918 virus - 'This is ordinary influenza by another name,' which of course, it wasn't. It's crystal clear that Trump himself knowingly said things that weren't true"" (such as : ""It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear"").And what did confusion over the constantly-evolving science do to trust and compliance? (Dr. Anthony Fauci's March 8, 2020 statement, ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" vs. Fauci's Oct. 29, 2020 support for community COVID protocols, ""the flagship of which is wearing a mask."")""You know, trust, truth, they're all interconnected,"" Barry said. Teichner asked, ""Was the result the same then and now?""""Well, clearly people who might otherwise have been alive, died in 1918,"" he replied. ""And clearly this time around, people didn't believe the truth when they were told the truth. The misinformation, the active attacks on vaccines, there's no question it's killed people.""Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University, sees 1918 amnesia happening again. ""We're already forgetting, even before the pandemic is over. We're already forgetting the pandemic. I foresee, at best, a long struggle about whether we will remember, really, at all, and if we remember, what that memory will be.""For example, our entertainment, Lincoln said, is like some parallel universe where COVID is invisible, or long gone. Not everyone is choosing to forget. In Barre, Vt, the self-proclaimed granite center of the world, the monument business is booming. ""We're up 25-30% depending on product lines; I think all domestic manufacturers are up,"" said Rob Boulanger, who manages the huge Rock of Ages plant. ""People are pre-buying, so people are looking at their mortality, right? And wanting to take care of those final arrangements before something happens.""Teichner asked, ""Has COVID influenced that?""""Oh, absolutely.""The longing to remember ‚Äì and be remembered ‚Äì a catalyst. ""I think that if we don't manage to properly memorialize those that have been lost in this pandemic, it says that people like my dad, his life, didn't matter,"" said Kristin Urquiza. She never got to say goodbye to her father, Mark Urquiza, who died on June 30, 2020, isolated, on a ventilator, in an Arizona hospital. It was pre-vaccine. Cases were rising, but Arizona had opened back up.""Sure, maybe he should have said no to coming together with his friends to celebrate the 'end' of the pandemic,"" Urquiza said. ""He was given false information upon which he made choices, and that cost him his life.""Urquiza founded a non-profit, Marked by COVID, advocating for permanent memorials and a CVOD Memorial Day. In Congress there's been limited support. She said, ""Our elected officials would much rather move on, and I'm here to say we're not going to let you.""Barry said, ""I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't really many memorials.""""But a million dead? Are they invisible?"" Teichner asked. ""Well, which party is gonna take credit for that, you know?"" he laughed. ""There's been an effort to create a COVID commission, like the 9/11 commission, which, unfortunately, nobody seems eager to accept.""For Barry, the 1918 flu should be justification enough ‚Äì proof of the cost in human lives of forgetting.

"Are there any moons that are made of gas? - Livescience.com
The planets in our solar system come in two forms: Some are rocky, and some are gaseous. But all of the moons in our solar system are rocky, even the ones that orbit gas giants. So why aren't some moons in the solar system made of gas? And are there gaseous moons anywhere in the universe?There are some very good reasons why no nearby moons are gaseous. And while we haven't found a gaseous moon beyond our solar system, it could be possible under the right conditions, said Jonathan Lunine, chair of the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University.Specifically, it would depend on the moon's mass, its surrounding temperature and the influence of tidal forces ‚Äî that is, the gravitational pull of a nearby body, like its host planet.¬†Related: To illustrate how these conditions might affect a gaseous moon, imagine that our own moon's rocky composition were replaced with pure hydrogen. Hydrogen gas is much less dense than rock, so right away, the moon would grow to about the size of Earth, Lunine said.In fact, the enormous size of gas giants like Jupiter is one reason they can exist. If they were too small, the force of gravity wouldn't be powerful enough to hold those light elements together.¬†But size isn't the only factor at play; there's also temperature.¬†""Let's take the moon as it is ‚Äî as a rock,"" Lunine told Live Science. ""And then let's put a hydrogen atmosphere around it. We know that hydrogen atmosphere is going to escape very quickly just due to thermal effects."" In other words, the warmth of the sun would cause the hydrogen to evaporate away.""And so what that would tell me is, an entirely hydrogen-composed Earth's moon at the distance of the Earth from the sun is not going to be stable,"" Lunine said. That's true even as far out as Pluto's orbit, he added.But even if our imaginary gas moon were the size of Earth and the surrounding temperature were very cold, its host planet would still probably rip it apart.¬†""Remember that the Earth's moon is subject to tidal forces from the Earth,"" Lunine said. ""So it's actually not a sphere. It's pulled out a bit, but it doesn't get torn apart because it has some material strength associated with it.""‚Äî‚ÄîDoes the moon rotate?‚ÄîThat's not the case with the hypothetical gaseous moon. ""Because it's a gas and not a solid ‚Äî even if it's very cold ‚Äî if it's orbiting around something else, it's going to get tidally stripped and torn apart by tides,"" Lunine said.So how could a gaseous moon ever be possible? The moon-planet system would have to be either very distant and cold, or very big.¬†""If it's the size of our moon, anywhere in our solar system, it's not going to work right. Way out in the depths of interstellar space? There, it's a question mark,"" Lunine said. ""If you want to make something super big, like a Neptune around a Jupiter, then sure, you can do it.‚ÄùIn that case, the gravitational forces holding these huge bodies together would likely keep tidal forces from destroying the Neptune-size moon.¬†""That could be perfectly stable,"" Lunine said.Originally published on Live Science.Ashley Hamer is a contributing writer for Live Science who has written about everything from space and quantum physics to health and psychology.

A natural impact on the moon created this crater in 2013. It's about to get another.¬†The impact took place on the far side of the moon out of view of any telescopes or spacecraft, but NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will be in a position to start taking photos of the impact site in mid-March.¬†  Modeling software company AGI developed this animation of how the crash may have appeared from a point above the moon.¬†Bill Gray, an amateur astronomer and software developer in Maine, first noticed the terminal trajectory. His software picked up the impact in an orbital model and Gray worked with observatories around the world to gather additional data and increase his confidence in the prediction.¬†Gray believes he misidentified the booster as a Falcon 9 years ago. He and other researchers since confirmed it to be the Chinese rocket part instead.¬†""I am astounded that we can tell the difference between the two rocket body options -- SpaceX versus Chinese -- and confirm which one will impact the moon with the data we have,""  in a statement in February. ""The differences we see are primarily due to type of paint used by SpaceX and the Chinese.""So the rocket about to hit the Moon, it turns out, is not the one we thought it was. This (an honest mistake) just emphasizes the problem with lack of proper  tracking of these deep space objects. https://t.co/JXKpUmEC2XThe rocket crashed into the lunar surface in a crater named Hertzsprung that's a little larger than the state of Iowa. The location is remote enough that the impact doesn't pose any threat to the Apollo mission or other space program landing sites. ""(The) rocket impact will provide a fortuitous experiment that could reveal a lot about how natural collisions pummel and scour planetary surfaces,"" University of Colorado Boulder planetary scientist Paul Hayne wrote¬†for The Conversation. ""A deeper understanding of impact physics will go a long way in helping researchers interpret the barren landscape of the Moon and also the effects impacts have on Earth and other planets.""Hayne expects the impact obliterated the rocket instantly, creating a white flash that could be visible if any spacecraft were in place with a vantage point.¬†""It will be the moon's newest archaeological site,""¬†. ""We'll learn something about the geology of the location from the color differences and distribution of the ejected material. It's an opportunity to learn more about the moon's mysterious far side.""Besides adding a new feature to the dark side of the moon, there's some concern it could also introduce tiny hitchhikers to our natural satellite.¬†""So I'm not bothered by one more crater being made on the moon,""¬† in The Conversation. ""It already has something like half a billion craters that are 10 meters or more in diameter. What we should worry about is contaminating the moon with living microbes, or molecules that could in the future be mistaken as evidence of former life on the moon.""The  last month raising its concern that not enough is being done to track space junk, as NASA and others hope to establish a permanent presence on the moon.""The upcoming lunar impact illustrates well the need for a comprehensive regulatory regime in space, not only for the economically crucial orbits around Earth but also applying to the moon,"" said Holger Krag, head of ESA's space safety program.This isn't the first time a spacecraft has slammed into the moon, although Gray thinks it might be the first time it's happening unintentionally. As recently as 2009,  in a search for water (it found some).¬†""In essence,"" Gray says, ""this is a 'free' Lcross."" ¬†",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/PbpCmgvOHgQuj-qmRDx7SdRHtus=/84x84/2011/10/17/73f135f8-8d74-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/headshots_Erick_Mack_140x100.jpg,"Russia has lost its power over NASA and in the space business: experts - New York Post
Russia continues to degrade its role in the space industry, alienating itself from international customers it has long supplied space resources to because President Vladimir Putin refused to back down from the attack on Ukraine.Since Russia began its invasion last week, the head of Russia‚Äôs space agency Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin refused to launch a UK-satellite company‚Äôs payloads and stopped supplying Russian-built rocket engines to US customers and threatened to cut ties with its International Space Station partners, including NASA.The most delicate ongoing space policy issue is the For over 20 years, NASA and Russia worked together to build and maintain the orbiting laboratory 200 miles above Earth. The first modules were American and Russian. The first two astronauts to enter the space station when the lights were turned on were an American and Russian cosmonaut together, an intentional choice by STS-88 mission Commander Robert Cabana.When the space shuttle program ended, the US lost its ride to space for American astronauts. It began purchasing seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft for more than $80 million for nine years until SpaceX began launching astronauts under NASA‚Äôs Commercial Crew Program.Since Elon Musk‚Äôs company began launching Americans from Florida in May 2020, NASA had purchased fewer seats from Russia and was negotiating for a cosmonaut to launch on SpaceX‚Äôs Crew Dragon when the Ukraine invasion began.Rogozin has threatened to pull out of the ISS altogether and ended on-orbit science activities between cosmonauts and their international astronaut counterparts.University of Central Florida space policy expert Roger Handberg said Russia has lost its upper hand.‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not getting money because a good part of their space program had been selling seats on Soyuz missions to the United States,‚Äù Handberg said. ‚ÄúThe Russians have lost their leverage, as you say, over the United States because they provided the access. Now we have independent access.‚ÄùIn April, NASA Astronauts Mark Vande Hei is set to undock from the space station with two cosmonauts and return to Earth on a Russian spacecraft landing in Kazakhstan. He may be the last American to fly on a Russian vehicle if the relationship deteriorates.Secondly, the US, Europe and Japan are working to extend the life of the ISS until 2030, but Russia has only committed to 2024, and those negotiations were also underway.If Russia drops out by 2030, that‚Äôs where things get complicated.‚ÄúDoes that mean we have to disassemble and take their modules off? That‚Äôs the kind of complicated question. We‚Äôre not there yet,‚Äù Handberg said.Since the end of the shuttle program, the ISS has depended on Russian spacecraft to lift the space station and move it in debris avoidance maneuvers.¬†However, the Northrop Grumman cargo spaceship Cygnus might be capable of taking on that job. A recently docked Cygnus at the ISS will conduct the first US reboost test while in orbit, potentially providing an alternative option.If Russia chooses to take immediate action and sever ties with its International Space Station partners, it‚Äôs unclear how that would work. The ISS was not designed to be divided.‚ÄúMany things are intertwined. So are we no longer allowed to use the Russian modules on this space station? Or vice versa, we don‚Äôt allow them to use our modules,‚Äù Handberg said.¬†‚ÄúIn the confined circumstances they‚Äôre in, that gets pretty bizarre.‚ÄùHandberg believes Russia is locked into the ISS until 2024, but there is always uncertainty with Putin.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/fox-news-logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=144&h=96&crop=1,"T. Rex might actually be three separate species, study claims - New York Post
The iconic¬†Tyrannosaurus rex, or ‚ÄúT. Rex,‚Äù might need to be re-categorized into three distinct species, according to researchers.¬†The Tyrannosaurus rex is the only recognized species of the group of dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus to date ‚Äì though previous research has reportedly acknowledged variation across Tyrannosaurs skeletal remains.¬†In a controversial new¬†study¬†published Tuesday in the¬†peer-reviewed journal Evolutionary Biology, South Carolina and Maryland¬†paleontologists¬†conducted an analysis of skeletal remains they said reveal physical differences in the femur and other bones and dental structures.Based on a dataset of 37 specimens, the group looked at the robustness in the femur of 24 specimens and measured the diameter of the base of teeth or space in the gums to assess if specimens had one or two slender teeth resembling incisors.¬†According to an accompanying¬†release, the scientists observed that the femur varied across specimens, with two times more robust femurs than svelte ones across specimens. Robust femurs were also found in some juvenile specimens and ‚Äúgracile‚Äù femurs were found in some that were full adult size, suggesting that variation is not related to growth.¬†Dental structure also varied and those with one incisorform tooth were correlated with often having higher femur gracility.They explained the Tyrannosaurus specimens ‚Äúexhibit such a remarkable degree of proportional variations, distributed at different stratigraphic levels, that the pattern favors multiple species at least partly separated by time; ontogenetic and sexual causes being less consistent with the data.‚Äù‚ÄúVariation in dentary incisiform counts correlate with skeletal robusticity and also appear to change over time,‚Äù the authors noted.¬†28 specimens could be identified in distinct layers of sediment at the Lancian upper Maastrichtian formations in North America ‚Äì which was estimated to be from between 67.5 to 66 million years ago ‚Äì and the¬†paleontologists¬†compared Tyrannosaurus¬†specimens with other theropod species found in lower layers of sediment.Only robust Tyrannosaurus femurs were found in the lower layer of sediment ‚Äì and variation was not different to that of other theropod species ‚Äì which the release said indicates that just one species of Tyrannosaurus likely existed at this point.¬†However, the variation in Tyrannosaurus femur robustness in the top layer of the sediments was higher, suggesting the specimens had physically developed into more distinct forms and other dinosaur species.¬†‚ÄúWe found that the changes in¬†Tyrannosaurus¬†femurs are likely not related to the sex or age of the specimen,‚Äù lead author Gregory Paul said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe propose that the changes in the femur may have evolved over time from a common ancestor who displayed more robust femurs to become more gracile in later species. The differences in femur robustness across layers of sediment may be considered distinct enough that the specimens could potentially be considered separate species.‚ÄùBased on that evidence, the researchers said three¬†morphotypes¬†‚Äì what Science Direct defines as any of a group of different types of individuals of the same species in a population ‚Äì and two additional species of Tyrannosaurus were ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù and named.¬†‚ÄúOne robust species with two small incisors in each dentary appears to have been present initially, followed by two contemporaneous species (one robust and another gracile) both of which had one small incisor in each dentary, suggesting both anagenesis and cladogenesis occurred,‚Äù they continued.¬†Evolution¬†can take place by¬†anagenesis, in which changes occur within a lineage. Whereas, in cladogenesis, a lineage splits into two or more separate lines.The authors nominated two potential species: ‚ÄúTyrannosaurus imperator‚Äù and ‚ÄúTyrannosaurus regina.‚ÄùTyrannosaurus imperator relates to specimens found at the lower and middle layers of sediment, with more robust femurs and usually two incisor teeth.Tyrannosaurus regina is linked to specimens from the upper and possibly middle layers of sediment, with slenderer femurs and one incisor tooth.¬†The Tyrannosaurus rex was identified in the upper and possibly middle layer of sediment, with more robust femurs and only one incisor tooth.¬†The authors acknowledged that they cannot rule out that variation is due to extreme individual differences, or atypical sexual dimorphism, rather than separate groups. They also cautioned that the location within sediment layers is not known for some specimens.¬†Reaction to the study from scientists has been largely skeptical, with some claiming the paper does not have enough evidence to reach its conclusions ‚Äì and raising¬†concerns¬†over some of the specimens included in the study to National Geographic.Paul¬†told¬†The New York Times on Feb. 28 that he knows his proposal is provocative.¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware that there could be a lot of people who aren‚Äôt going to be happy about this,‚Äù he told the publication. ‚ÄúAnd, my response to them is: Publish a refutation.‚Äù",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/fox-news-logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=144&h=96&crop=1,"NASA is offering people the chance to fly their name around the moon on its upcoming Artemis 1 mission - Yahoo News

"Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúPeek Performance‚Äù March event: What to expect - The Verge
Apple is poised for its first livestream event of 2022 on Tuesday, March 8th at 1PM ET. The company sent out press invitation emails for the event titled ‚ÄúPeek Performance,‚Äù with  Apple will announce a new third-generation iPhone SE with 5G.The iPad Air might also get a new spec bump update at the event, with upgrades to both 5G and an A15 Bionic processor, similar to last year‚Äôs iPad Mini. Another rumor suggests an  alongside a redesigned MacBook Air might be coming. New Macs, including a Mac Mini with an M1 Pro / M1 Max processor update, could also get a showing, and new iMac and Mac Pro hardware are said to be in the works ‚Äî but those will likely show up later in the year. Whatever the case might be, we might see at least one of these new Macs on March 8th.That‚Äôs not all Apple might announce on Tuesday, so prime your expectations for the Apple event by reading about all the rumors and details below.The upcoming third-generation iPhone SE is expected to succeed the 2020 model as the new budget-friendly iPhone option. The first iPhone SE came out in 2016 and remained available for four years, which means the SE line is set for a quicker change of pace.According to reliable analyst and leaker Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone SE 3 will probably include the latest A15 Bionic chip, 5G with millimeter wave, 64GB base storage with 128GB / 256GB options, and retain the design and colors of the current model. Kuo  on a verified account that has remained quiet until now.Some predictions for the coming new iPhone SE:1. Mass production in Mar'22.2. Estimated shipments of 25-30 mn units in 2022.3. Storage: 64/128/256GB.4. A15 & 5G support (mmW & Sub-6 GHz).5. Casing: white, black, and red.6. Similar form factor design to current SE.The 2020 iPhone SE offered shockingly good value with the then-latest chipset, but its battery life was never the star of the show. Now that US carriers only want phones with 5G on their shelves, the battery life in a new iPhone SE would be a bigger concern ‚Äî especially if the form factor remains the same. The current iPhone SE body models the iPhone 8, but its aging design language dates all the way back to 2014 with the iPhone 6.It‚Äôs also possible that the iPhone SE could borrow the form factor of the iPhone 13 Mini. Due to reports of less than expected sales of the iPhone 12 Mini, it‚Äôs rumored that the iPhone 13 Mini might be Apple‚Äôs last compact mainline phone. But just as the iPhone SE from 2016 carried on the compact design of the iPhone 5s, and the 2020 iPhone SE copied the smaller iPhone 8 design, the iPhone SE might become the new home for the Mini.There‚Äôs no word on price yet, but don‚Äôt expect to see a reduction to the starting $399 price. 5G modems are still expensive, so a starting storage option of 64GB makes sense if the price is to remain intact. Touch ID would also keep costs down if the design remains.The iPad Air received an iPad Pro-style redesign in 2020: it got flat edges, thin bezels, Apple Pencil 2 support, USB-C, and a new Touch ID sleep / wake button. But the still fresh design is already lagging behind: the iPad Mini from last year followed the design of the iPad Air but one-upped it with with the latest A15 Bionic processor and 5G data options (though just sub-6GHz and no millimeter wave support).So it makes sense for Apple to roll out an updated iPad Air with the latest A15 Bionic processor and with a 5G option ‚Äî and perhaps center stage as well. And although FaceID would welcome, don‚Äôt expect any other changes.It‚Äôs possible that Apple announces a new MacBook Air with a new M2 chip at this event. The current design of the MacBook Air dates back to 2018 and was a testbed for the Apple M1 chip debut in 2020.We reviewed the current MacBook Air with M1 as one of the best laptops you could buy in 2020, with a score that was cut short of perfect only because of the less-than-stellar webcam.But it‚Äôs 2022 now, and we have freshly updated MacBook Pro designs with better screens and a better camera that you can expect the MacBook Air will soon follow. It might even come with a notch.A new Mac Mini was , but it never showed up. Right now, the only way to harness the power of the latest M1 Pro and M1 Max chips is in the latest MacBook Pro models. A new Mac Mini with the latest processor options would change that.The current Mac Mini design dates back to 2010, which was made to be just large enough to fit an optical drive. So it‚Äôs about time we get a new Mac Mini chassis, but if we don‚Äôt, then hopefully, we will at least get a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù looking space gray finish again. We could even see Mac Mini split up into a pro option and a standard option that comes with a new M2 processor.Right now, there‚Äôs only one iMac option with M1 processors, but it only has a 24-inch screen option. If we don‚Äôt see new larger iMacs on Tuesday, we might see it later in the year. The iMac Pro was also discontinued a year ago, so that would make for an interesting surprise, though there haven‚Äôt been any supply chain leaks that would indicate a new version is imminent. There‚Äôs also the Mac Pro that has no M1 option yet ‚Äî and while it‚Äôs rumored to be in the works, don‚Äôt hold your breath for that one on Tuesday.The last time Apple held an event in March was in 2019, a live presentation that showcased new premium Apple services like Apple TV Plus. Three years later, it‚Äôs very possible Apple could showcase new TV shows or movies like it did last September.Some speculation of the meaning of Apple‚Äôs event invite title ‚ÄúPeek Performance‚Äù points to the word ‚ÄúPeek‚Äù as the name of a VR / AR product. While Apple‚Äôs long-rumored headset product is , perhaps there‚Äôs a chance Apple can surprise and delight ‚Äî just don‚Äôt expect to see an Apple Car anytime soon.Apple is also expected to release some software updates: iOS 15.4 that can let your Face ID-enabled iPhone  and also a macOS Monterey plus iPad OS 15.4 update that will finally enable the iPad to Mac traversing Universal Control feature.Check out all the latest Apple news as it breaks here on The Verge.Please confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hdOrD2V50xZHae3K5CDsbVG2uY=/0x0:1198x728/1200x800/filters:focal(504x269:694x459)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70585589/Screen_Shot_2022_03_02_at_12.03.10_PM.0.jpg,"Halo Infinite‚Äôs campaign co-op won‚Äôt arrive with season two in May - The Verge

If you‚Äôre not excited about Apple‚Äôs upcoming Peek Performance keynote, you‚Äôre not the only one. According to most reports, the company will announce new iPhone SE and iPad Air models at the event. It‚Äôs not the most exciting stuff. But according to Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman, Apple could have a surprise up its sleeve that would make Tuesday considerably more interesting. In his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman writes he ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt rule out‚Äù Apple previewing a next-generation display at the event.Predictions for Apple's new desktop products:1. 2022: More powerful Mac mini and more affordable external display (27-inch without mini-LED).2. 2023: Mac Pro and iMac Pro.He reports the company completed development on a new monitor ‚Äúmonths ago,‚Äù and had originally planned to release it ‚Äúsoon after‚Äù the launch of last year‚Äôs MacBook Pro. Given there have been reports suggesting Apple will announce a new high-end Mac mini at the event, a matching display doesn‚Äôt sound out of the realm of possibility. To that point, Apple has reportedly been working on two new monitors for the past few years. A report from 9to5Mac published earlier in the week shed light on a possible 7K successor to the Pro Display XDR that will feature an A13 processor to offload some processing tasks. The monitor Gurman references would appear to be a more affordable model that would succeed the company‚Äôs long discontinued Thunderbolt Display.",https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ouKkXPzWkbSjR1J5UN6Smg--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQ1NDt3PTY3NTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc271e90-350a-11ec-ab7c-6d5adf8edae1.cf.jpg,"How to avoid or remove the red square health debuff in 'Elden Ring' - NME

"Conservative think tank's exclusive gathering will include Biden official ‚Äî but not Trump - CBS News
A private, off-the-record gathering of conservative leaders and wealthy donors will convene this week in Sea Island, Georgia, with appearances by a Biden White House official and several critics of former President Donald Trump.Trump was not invited to the exclusive event, which will be attended by some of the Republican Party's biggest donors, according to two people familiar with the event who were not authorized to discuss it.The conservative American Enterprise Institute's annual World Forum this year will be held at The Cloister, a high-end hotel complex in Sea Island, and feature invite-only discussions, meals and access to miles of private beach. The schedule for this year's forum was obtained by CBS News.The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit watchdog that focuses on corruption and abuses of power, has described the gathering as a ""secretive"" event ""where industry titans and GOP megadonors [mingle] with mostly Republican power players at an exclusive, 'off-the-record' retreat."" Past attendees have included billionaire executives from global manufacturing, energy, and financial companies.The makeup of this year's conference reflects AEI's drift in recent years. While the nonpartisan ‚Äî but historically conservative ‚Äî group has previously supported aspects of Trump's agenda, many of its scholars have become critics of the former president, particularly after he refused to concede defeat in the 2020 presidential election.¬†This year's guest list also underscores how some leaders inside the establishment wing of the Republican Party and their allies on the right are increasingly eager to move on from Trump and loosen his grip on the conservative movement.One of the key speakers at this week's gathering will be Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been working behind the scenes to recruit candidates who come from a more traditional Republican mold, in terms of both policy positions and rhetoric, as he works to reclaim the Senate majority later this year in the midterm elections.Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, who Trump has harshly criticized for refusing to endorse his efforts to decertify President Joe Biden's 2020 win in the state, will also speak at the forum, according to the schedule. McConnell repeatedly attempted to recruit Ducey to jump into Arizona's Senate race, but the governor declined to do so.And instead of celebrating Trump, like the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando last month, this year's AEI World Forum will feature Democrats alongside congressional Republican officials and possible contenders for the party's 2024 presidential nomination.One of those Democrats is Brian Deese, Mr. Biden's top economic adviser. Deese is slated to appear in front of the World Forum audience on Friday, March 11, giving the White House a rare private platform in front of influential GOP donors and business leaders. Deese will be in conversation with AEI's James Pethokoukis for a breakfast discussion, ""An Interview with the Director of the National Economic Council.""¬†The two people familiar with the event noted that AEI has previously hosted Democrats at the World Forum, including economic officials from the Obama White House.¬†Jesse Lee, a senior communications adviser to the National Economic Council, said Sunday in a statement, ""The Biden White House has successfully found common ground on things like the bipartisan infrastructure law and competitiveness legislation by reaching out to stakeholders across the spectrum. We will continue to talk to anybody who has an interest in collaborating toward our goal of building long term growth that benefits all Americans.""A spokesman for AEI declined to comment. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment.AEI is currently led by Robert Doar, a mild-mannered Republican policy expert on poverty who has worked for Republicans as well as for Michael Bloomberg, who is currently a Democrat but has in the past been a registered Republican and independent. Doar worked in the Bloomberg administration when Bloomberg was an independent and the mayor of New York.¬†In 2019, the AEI World Forum drew attention when it was reported that then-Vice President Mike Pence was sharply questioned by former Vice President Dick Cheney about the Trump administration's foreign policy, highlighting how various players in AEI's orbit have long been uncomfortable with elements of Trump's populist and nationalist policies.¬†It is unclear whether Pence was invited to the 2022 event.Conservative Trump critics will also be featured during various Sea Island sessions this week. AEI fellow and veteran columnist Jonah Goldberg, who recently departed Fox News, is listed several times on the schedule. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a vocal critic of Trump who has warned fellow Republicans against ""whitewashing"" last year's attack on the Capitol, will speak on Thursday. Hogan has expressed interest in running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.¬†But Trump allies will be present as well. Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, who has been outspoken about her support for the former president, and Senator Rick Scott of Florida, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee and has  to Trump, will both appear.¬†Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, another potential 2024 presidential candidate, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, and retiring Senator Rob Portman of Ohio will also appear.The people familiar with the event cautioned that some scheduled speakers may drop out in the coming days due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, an ally of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is scheduled to attend and speak, according to the schedule. But it is uncertain if she will end up making the event.Trump, meanwhile, is scheduled to hold a rally in Florence, South Carolina, about 250 miles to the north of Sea Island, on March 12.",https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/03/07/ad8a34b4-15e8-4329-8e6d-33e14ebba652/thumbnail/620x413/2d0e39eb4256d9ad8e87bae226945799/gettyimages-1358120025.jpg#,"Thousands evacuated in Florida amid massive wildfires | TheHill - The Hill
