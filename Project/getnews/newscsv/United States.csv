"Timely 3-pointers in 4th quarter by Phoenix Suns' Devin Booker 'melted' Milwaukee Bucks in Game 2 win - ESPN
PHOENIX -- With the Milwaukee Bucks breathing down the Phoenix Suns' necks on Thursday, threatening to erase a once 15-point lead and head back home with a series split, the Suns relied on the guy who ticks off Chris Paul when he doesn't do precisely what he did in the fourth quarter of Game 2 of the NBA Finals.Shoot. And shoot some more.Devin Booker scored nine of his team-high 31 points in the final frame, hitting a trio of timely triples to stave off the Bucks' comeback attempt. The Suns had a historic night as a team from beyond the arc in the 118-108 win.""Those are the moments that he lives for,"" Phoenix coach Monty Williams said of Booker. ""Doesn't run from it. ... He just steps up and makes big plays.""The Bucks started the fourth quarter on a 6-2 spurt to cut the Suns' lead to six when Booker, with the 7-foot Brook Lopez flailing a hand in his face, sunk a sidestep 3 to push the lead back to nine with 9:41 remaining.A couple minutes later, after Milwaukee had pulled within seven, he hit back-to-back 3s in the span of 31 seconds to balloon the lead up to 13, sending the crowd into a frenzy.And it led to the Bucks staring down a 2-0 series hole.""Every time Book hit a 3 or did something, you could just tell it just melted them down,"" Suns guard Mikal Bridges, who scored 27, said of Milwaukee. ""[They were thinking] like, 'Dang, we was right there.'""It was Booker's eighth game with 30-plus points in these playoffs out of the 18 games Phoenix has played on its way to the championship round. His 490 total points this postseason rank third all time for a player competing in his first playoffs, according to ESPN Stats & Information research, trailing only Rick Barry (521) and Julius Erving (518).""The thing about Devin, he shoots the same way first quarter, fourth quarter, doesn't matter, his shot looks the same,"" Williams said. ""That's a guy that's put a ton of work in his shot, but the mentality, he's calm in those moments. So, we're grateful for those contributions in those moments.""Paul, who complemented Booker's offensive outburst with 23 points and eight assists of his own, was a little more pointed with the bar he has set for his 24-year-old teammate.""If Book shoots it, I expect it to go in,"" Paul said. ""I get mad at him when he don't shoot.""Booker finished 7-of-12 from 3 on a night his team went 20-for-40, tying the record for second-most 3s ever made in a Finals game.""I mean, the guys work on it,"" Williams said of his group's output. ""We have a let-it-fly mentality.""But while teammates marveled at his play -- ""He's not going to run from any fight, battle, situation that the basketball court presents,"" Jae Crowder said -- Booker gave the credit right back to those with whom he shares the court.""That's just team,"" Booker said. ""Team basketball. I think a few of [the shots] were open, and we prepared for these moments.""For Paul, who is within reach of the title he has been chasing for 16 years, he said he has appreciated pairing with Booker in that pursuit.""He just stays in attack mode all game long,"" Paul said. ""And that's what I love about him.""",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Padres' Daniel Camarena enters MLB history books with improbable grand slam - Fox News

Just under 40 Republican lawmakers have written to the US Olympic Committee to express concerns about the possibility of American athletes staging political protests at the Summer Games in Tokyo.The representatives urged the USOC to remind competitors to obey Rule 50 of the  charter which bans political expression by athletes during the games.Fox News reports that the letter to US Olympic and Paralympic Committee Chair Susanne Lyons and CEO Sarah Hirshland was signed by 39 members of Congress and specifically singled out hammer thrower Gwen Berry, who turned away during the national anthem at trials in June.Ms Berry also held up a T-shirt with the slogan “Activist Athlete”.“We are deeply concerned by the growing trend of American athletes taking advantage of the international platform afforded by the Olympic games to perpetuate divisive, hateful, and anti-American ideologies,” the letter reads.Among those who signed were representatives Dan Crenshaw of Texas, Debbie Lesko of Arizona, Jim Banks of Indiana, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.The lawmakers also singled out BMX freestyle rider Chelsea Wolfe, who is attending the Olympics as an alternate. In a now-deleted Facebook post, Ms Wolfe declared that she wanted to win at the Tokyo Games so that she could “burn a US flag on the podium”.She has since told Fox News: “Anyone who thinks that I don’t care about the United States is sorely mistaken.”“One of the reasons why I work so hard to represent the United States in international competition is to show the world that this country has morals and values, that it’s not all of the bad things that we’re known for,” Ms Wolfe added.The Republican lawmakers conclude their letter by saying: “It is our hope that members of the US Olympic Team will stop abusing their platform to spout shameful anti-American rhetoric, and that all athletes representing the United States of America at the Olympic games this summer will do so proudly and patriotically.”According to Article 50 of the Olympic charter: “No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”IOC President Thomas Bach reiterated and defended the rule in January 2020 issued specific guidelines regarding protests at the games.Mr Bach emphasised the neutrality of the games saying that it is undermined when used as a stage for any agenda no matter how legitimate it may be.While in-person protests during anthems are considered as “divisive disruption” and may result in disciplinary action, athletes are permitted to post opinions on social media.Gwen Berry (L) turns away from US flag during the national anthem on day nine of the 2020 US Olympic Track & Field Team Trials in Eugene, OregonWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When Dustin Poirier and Conor McGregor fought back in January, one of the main storylines heading into the bout was the different demeanor around McGregor. The sport’s most preeminent trash talker came into UFC 257 respectful and subdued, not there to play the dozens, just to win a fight. Then he got knocked out. So it’s no surprise that at the UFC 264 pre-fight press conference on Thursday, McGregor treated things much differently.The former two-division UFC champion spent the bulk of the press conference returning to his old trash-talking ways and doing his level best to get under the skin of Poirier like he did in their first fight, . Following the presser though, it’s clear that it didn’t work.“For me, smooth sailing,” Poirier told ESPN shortly after the press conference. “I felt like I saw a guy who is unsure of himself, scared, trying to hype himself up. I felt good.... I knew he was going to be acting crazy but to see him in the flesh, it just made me feel good because he is that little guy. Not that guy he used to be, I feel, or through my eyes, anyway.”It had to help that Poirier, like many,  that served him so well during his build up to superstardom. But for Poirier, that well has run dry. The former UFC interim lightweight champion said that sharing the stage with McGregor on Thursday just reinforced his belief in himself.“Just how crazy (he was),” Poirier said. “I feel like he has to work himself up to be that guy and I am that guy. I don’t have to do that, I know. If you had got close enough, you’d have seen it. That’s it. That’s just it. I know who I am. I don’t have to be crazy.“It was kind of like that made him less powerful because he’s talking silly stuff about my wife, she’s my husband or something. Like, what the f*ck are you even talking about. He shouldn’t even be talking about marriages with the sh*t he’s out there doing.”Though praised for his mental warfare early in his career, McGregor’s schtick hasn’t worked out as well for him in recent years and Poirier is particularly well-suited to deal with it. Poirier has been open about his loss to McGregor back in 2014 and how McGregor won the mental battle before they even stepped inside the cage. Following that loss, Poirier then reevaluated his career entirely and became a much better fighter in the ensuing years because of it. In contrast, McGregor has done his best to delegitimize Poirier’s win from January, and as they head into the rubber match on Saturday, Poirier believes McGregor should have taken a lesson from him.“He’s doing himself a disservice by not reassessing everything and figuring out what really went wrong,” Poirier said. “That’s what losers do. They scramble to find something to stand on and that’s what he’s doing.”Poirier and McGregor face off for the final time in the main event of UFC 264 this Saturday at the T-Mobile Arena, in Las Vegas, NV.Notorious.

"How New Biden Rules Could Make It Easier To Buy Hearing Aids Or Fix Your Phone - NPR

President Biden is set to unveil a new plan on Friday taking aim at powerful industries where a handful of players have so much market clout that they can drive up prices, depress wages and make it hard for small companies to break in.His executive order on competition contains directives for a dozen government agencies to take 72 measures — some big, some small — to shake up key markets for consumers, workers, farmers and small businesses, White House officials told NPR. They spoke on the condition of anonymity ahead of Biden's announcement.The White House is just getting started on what it hopes will be a new era of enforcement of antitrust laws in which mergers are challenged more often and unfair practices are cracked down on, the officials said.News about some of the measures trickled out earlier this week, including a plan to and pare back unnecessary licensing requirements for jobs.The executive order also includes plans to allow hearing aids to be sold over the counter at pharmacies and to , according to information viewed by NPR ahead of the announcement.Some of the rules pick up where competition advocates in the Obama administration left off.""We started this effort in our last year, and it took awhile to even figure out what we wanted to do, and then it takes a long time to write a rule or to make sure you're enforcing a rule,"" said Jason Furman, who led the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama White House.""We got a good start, but it was only a start,"" said Furman, now a professor of economic policy at Harvard. ""What's really important here is that President Biden is doing this in his first year.""Some of the most sweeping measures target the tech sector. The White House wants Obama-era net neutrality rules to be restored — measures that prevent internet providers from throttling their service.Other measures would make it easier to compare prices for internet services, ban steep early termination bills, and stop landlords from having exclusive arrangements with providers.The White House is expected to signal that it will scrutinize mergers in the tech sector, particularly when established players buy up new competitors and deals that affect the privacy of consumers and their data.Details and enforcement of many of these directives would fall to the , a high-profile critic of big technology companies.But the White House will also urge the FTC to focus on competition in the health care sector, including a ban on deals where pharmaceutical drugmakers pay to delay the release of generic drugs.Biden also will create a new competition council at the White House to track progress on the 72 ideas and come up with new measures to add to the list.That systematic approach should pay dividends, Furman said. He explained that a series of small and medium measures can add up to big changes.For example, he said, hearing aids — an expensive market dominated by a few players — is one area ripe for competition. The Obama administration tried to make it possible to buy more types of hearing aids at pharmacies, just like reading glasses, rather than treating them like expensive medical devices.""That won't transform our economy,"" Furman said, ""but for a lot of people, that'll save them thousands of dollars. And that's the type of action you want to do over and over again.""",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/05/07/the-npr-politics-podcast_final_sq-ecdd1508be24f14c6b6ee98e6627cbf2be192ea6-s800-c15.jpg,"Wells Fargo shuts down personal lines of credit – will your credit score be hurt? - WRAL Tech Wire
by Allison Morrow and Matt Egan, CNN Business — July 9, 2021 .Wells Fargo is shutting down all of its existing personal lines of credit, sparking outrage from consumers and advocates.A spokesperson for the bank said Wells Fargo made the decision last year as part of an effort to simplify its product offerings. The bank feels it can better meet borrowing needs through credit cards and personal loans, the spokesperson said.The popular consumer lending product that the bank is shuttering typically lets users borrow up to $100,000, according to CNBC, which reported the news earlier Thursday. The product was advertised to consumers as a way to consolidate higher-interest credit card debt or pay for home renovations.In notices to customers about the closure, the bank warned that the change could impact their credit scores.Wells Fargo was trending on Twitter Thursday night following CNBC’s report, with consumer advocates, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, expressing outrage.“Not a single @WellsFargo customer should see their credit score suffer just because their bank is restructuring after years of scams and incompetence. Sending out a warning notice simply isn’t good enough — Wells Fargo needs to make this right.”The news comes more than four years after a scandal erupted in which the bank admitted to opening millions of fake accounts, as well as forcing customers to pay for unneeded auto insurance or charging unnecessary mortgage fees. The Federal Reserve called it “widespread customer abuse,” and in 2018 the central bank imposed a cap on Wells Fargo’s assets — essentially barring the it from increasing its balance sheet until it addresses the compliance failures that led to the scandal.",https://www.wraltechwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/wells-fargo-branch-1280x575.jpg,"Stocks making the biggest moves in the premarket: Levi, General Motors, American Airlines and more - CNBC

"LISTING OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRESS RELEASES - Los Angeles County

			The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) confirms a 165% increase of new cases over last week with 839 new cases of COVID-19.     
   The County’s daily average case rate is now 3.5 cases per 100,000 people, an increase from last week’s rate of 1.74 cases per 100,000.      
   Today’s daily test positivity rate is 2.5%, also an increase from last week’s rate of 1.2%.       
With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   The County’s daily average case rate is now 3.5 cases per 100,000 people, an increase from last week’s rate of 1.74 cases per 100,000.      
   Today’s daily test positivity rate is 2.5%, also an increase from last week’s rate of 1.2%.       
With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   Today’s daily test positivity rate is 2.5%, also an increase from last week’s rate of 1.2%.       
With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

With the recent rise in cases, tracking the proliferation of variants of concern remains a priority to better understand the factors that may be contributing to increased community transmission.  Public Health is watching particularly closely for Delta variants which were first detected in India, and are now estimated to comprise about half of U.S. cases.    
   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   The Delta variant has been the most commonly sequenced variant in L.A. County since the beginning of June, now accounting for the majority of variants of concern identified by labs. From June 20 and June 26, the number of sequenced Delta variants was 63, 54% of all sequences collected that week.  The rising proportion of Delta among sequenced variants of concern is consistent with what other parts of the U.S. are seeing, and for certain represents increased circulation of the variant.  Given that slightly under 4 million residents in L.A. County are not yet vaccinated, the risk of increased spread remains high.  The data to date suggests fully vaccinated people are well protected from severe infections with the Delta variant.      
   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   Among 4.6 million fully vaccinated people in L.A. County, Public Health identified 2,822 people who tested positive for a COVID-19 infection contracted more than two weeks after they were fully vaccinated. That means that about 0.06% of all fully vaccinated people tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 195 people, 0.004% of those fully vaccinated, were hospitalized for infections contracted while fully vaccinated. And 21 people died of their infections, 0.0004%. These numbers are very similar to the numbers seen last week.    
   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   As of July 4, more than 10,580,529 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to people across Los Angeles County. Of these, 5,889,505 were first doses and 4,691,024 were second doses. Among L.A. County residents 16 and over, 69% have received one dose of vaccine and 60% have been fully vaccinated. Among L.A. County seniors 65 and over, 88% have received one dose of vaccine and 77% have been fully vaccinated.    
   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   Of the 11 new deaths reported today, three people that passed away were over the age of 80, three people who died were between the ages of 65 and 79, one person who died was between the ages of 50 and 64, and  four people who died were between the ages of 30 and 49. To date, Public Health identified 1,254,354 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,525 deaths. There are 296 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 24% of these people are in the ICU. Testing results are available for nearly 7,084,000 individuals with 16% of people testing positive.      
   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

   ""We share our deepest condolences with those of you who have lost friends, loved ones, and family during this difficult time,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “The data makes it increasingly clear that vaccines remain the most important tool we have to keep COVID-19 transmission and the incubation of variants low. Overall COVID-19 trends are going in the wrong direction for everyone, and are particularly concerning given the proliferation of the Delta variant. The most powerful way to protect those in hard-hit communities, many of whom are essential workers, is to close vaccination gaps. We continue to emphasize workers’ rights to safety because workers need to be able to do their jobs without unnecessary risks to themselves, their families and their friends.  COVID-19 remains a highly infectious virus that is easily transmitted, particularly indoors. The good news is that protecting workers is not complicated: mobile vaccination teams are available to come to workplaces, masks and respirators are in good supply, and our team is available to answer questions and address concerns. Let’s continue to take care of each other and get back to slowing down COVID-19 transmission.”    
   To make it as easy as possible for eligible L.A. County residents to get vaccinated, L.A. County continues to offer vaccines at many different sites across the county. This week, there are 767 sites offering vaccinations including pharmacies, clinics, community sites, and hospitals and 173 sites where mobile teams will be offering vaccinations, which are concentrated in higher-need, harder hit areas.  You can obtain vaccines at county-run sites, all the LA city-run sites, almost all mobile sites, and many community sites without an appointment.  Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
   Beginning tomorrow, Friday July 9 through next Thursday, July 15 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of seven packages of concert tickets. Prizes will include tickets to see Celine Dion, Grupo Firma, Kane Brown, Luke Bryan, and Dan and Shay at Staples Center, and box seats to four classical concerts at the Hollywood Bowl.   Official rules and participating site locations will be posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. The Huntington Botanical Gardens, Descanso Gardens, L.A. County Arboretum, and South Coast Botanic Garden tickets and passes sweepstakes is currently in effect through the end of the day today.

The Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine has been pitched with one major advantage over its counterparts since it was authorized for use: It requires just one dose. But with the exponential spread of the highly transmissible delta variant, questions have arisen over whether recipients might need to ""top off"" their immunity against the now-dominant strain in the U.S. with a second shot.Although the J&J vaccine's efficacy at protecting against symptomatic COVID-19 in clinical trials was less than the two-dose mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, it showed 100% effectiveness .Recent research suggests that mRNA vaccines, such as the Pfizer and Moderna, appear to hold up against the delta variant as long as you've been fully vaccinated with two doses.Pfizer reported Thursday that  six to 12 months after being fully vaccinated, may give more protection and promised to have data to publish in the coming week to ask the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend a third dose.Johnson and Johnson has put out its own data suggesting that their single dose also holds up against the dominant variant, but it was a small study and people are thinking more is more.The promising preliminary data suggests that the J&J vaccine offers good protection against the delta variant.In a laboratory experiment, researchers analyzed the blood of 10 people who had been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and tested it against multiple concerning variants, including delta.They found the vaccine appeared to work against the variants, shown by ""neutralizing antibody titers"" and other immune system response indicators.What level immune response is required to achieve protection is still open science, but the experiment offered promising clues, if not definitive proof of real-world protection.The news offers some measure of reassurance for the more than 12 million Americans who have received the J&J vaccine; it's also prompting some medical experts to reevaluate what role a ""booster"" shot might have -- whether it'll still be needed, and if so, when, and for whom.""The new data does in fact change my opinion,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist from Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News medical contributor. ""We try as much as possible to stick to the science when it comes to vaccine strategy, and overall this is really encouraging news.""All vaccines available in the U.S. have so far shown to be both safe and effective for at least up to eight months. Brownstein said that receiving a booster is likely safe, and looks forward to further data. In the meantime, this new data lends some hope to those who received the J&J vaccine, that for now, they still have protection.""We want to wait for data to support any kind of vaccine strategy that we recommend,"" Brownstein said, highlighting the importance of uniform recommendations backed by data.The science has yet to be settled, experts say.""I think there are still open questions for those who are immunocompromised,"" Brownstein said. ""Talk to your doctor -- especially if you're in the high-risk category.""Dr. William Schaffner, professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, explained that ""when talking about people who are immunocompromised, that includes a large spectrum of disease, and there are no studies at the present time to indicate that an additional dose will benefit you or what sort of reactions you might get from an additional dose.""For now, Schaffner firmly stands against the idea of an additional booster shot without formal recommendations. He emphasized that the CDC is yet to recommend any booster, under any circumstances at the present time.""People are making these recommendations on the basis of hope: hope that it would work and hope there wouldn't be any adverse events. But there certainly has been no formal study to support it at this time,"" Schaffner added.""Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,"" the agencies said in the statement Thursday. ""FDA, CDC, and NIH (National Institutes of Health) are engaged in a science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster might be necessary.""While many experts remain split on the issue of boosters, it's not for lack of confidence in the single-shot vaccine doing its job. Dr. Vin Gupta, a critical care pulmonologist and faculty at University of Wisconsin Medicine, said an added booster shot on top of the single J&J vaccine would essentially be an additional layer of protection.Gupta advocated for a booster not because he thinks the J&J shot doesn't work well, but rather, to ensure level protection for all vaccines across the board.

""Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,"" it says. — Josh Wingrove (@josh_wingrove) July 9, 2021If you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, you don’t need a booster shot to protect against the Delta variant, the US government says.The CDC and the FDA teamed up to issue a reassuring statement after Pfizer announced it was developing a booster shot .The Thursday evening press release said inoculated Americans were “protected from severe disease and death, including from the variants currently circulating the country.” Pfizer’s announcement came days after the vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease has dropped to 64 percent.The drug company’s chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, claimed that dip was due to new infections in people who had been vaccinated in January or February and now have waning antibodies.“It’s a small data set, but I think the trend is accurate: Six months out, given that Delta is the most contagious variant we have seen, it can cause infections and mild disease,” Dolsten said Thursday.Pfizer claims a booster shot would increase antibody levels in patients five or 10 times over, but conceded that overseas data shows fully vaccinated people are still 95 percent protected from severe disease.US health agencies pushed back saying they are undergoing a “science-based, rigorous process to consider whether or when a booster shot might be necessary.”“We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed,” the CDC and FDA said.With Post wiresShare Selection",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"5 areas with low COVID vaccine rates put U.S. at risk from Delta variant and further mutations, experts say - CBS News
Five under-vaccinated regions of the U.S. could be putting the entire nation at risk, according to researchers at Georgetown University. The fear is COVID-19 could mutate so significantly in these areas, it could defeat vaccines.An analysis by Georgetown University researchers found five significant clusters in the southern and lower Midwestern part of the U.S. They include portions of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and New Mexico. The Biden administration is sounding the alarm about a rapid rise in the Delta variant, which is significantly more widespread than previously thought. ""To be clear, there will likely continue to be an increase in cases among unvaccinated Americans,"" said White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients. A study published in the journal Nature on Thursday suggests that having only one dose of a vaccine offers little protection against the Delta variant. There are 25 million people in the U.S. who have received only one shot, and 140 million are unvaccinated, leaving 45% of the country at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In Missouri, the Delta variant accounts for 73% of new COVID cases, according to the CDC. In Texas, a youth camp near Austin may be the nation's latest super-spreader event. More than 100 cases have been confirmed, and officials fear the number may eventually top 200.""We believe that this is an outbreak of the Delta variant,"" said Dr. Philip Keiser, Galveston County's local health authority. At Houston Methodist Hospital, the Delta variant is responsible for 42% of new cases. The hospital expects the Delta variant to make up 90% of its cases in the next two to three weeks. ""The majority of patients that we are seeing hospitalized with COVID-19 with the Delta variant, the vast, vast majority of those patients are unvaccinated,"" said Dr. Wesley Long, the director of medical microbiology at Houston Methodist Hospital. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said those who are most vulnerable and live in low vaccination areas should take precautions.""If you are an elderly person or if you have a person with an underlying disease, you might want to go the extra mile of protection of wearing a mask if you are indoors,"" he said Thursday. ",https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/07/09/d938faba-e0f8-4244-b4c2-005515c06803/thumbnail/620x349/207245fbbfdd065549156cf03a4e2dc6/clusters-undervaccinated-portions-us-labels.jpg#,"Mercy becomes the latest St. Louis health care system to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations - St. Louis Post-Dispatch
RN Jen Ryder administers a COVID-19 vaccination to Anesthesiologist Don Arnold on Monday, Dec. 14, 2020, at Mercy Hospital St. Louis. Mercy St Louis was hoping to vaccinate about 72 frontline staff who work directly with COVID-19 patients – nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, housekeeping. Photo by Laurie Skrivan, ST. LOUIS — Mercy Health on Wednesday directed of all its employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 30, becoming the fourth major St. Louis area hospital system to require staff to get the shots.The move comes as Missouri hospital and public health officials are doing all they can to encourage vaccination as the best tool to fight the more infectious and dangerous delta variant of the coronavirus.Low vaccination rates coupled with the variant have been blamed for a , including an increase in patients younger than 18 at one hospital in southwest Missouri — the area of the state hit hardest.Mercy has hospitals and clinics across southwest Missouri, including Joplin and Springfield, as well as in the St. Louis area. The health system also serves communities in Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas.Arkansas and Missouri lead the United States in the rate of new coronavirus cases.Dr. William Sistrunk, Mercy infectious disease specialist, said the vaccine requirement is essential in protecting the health of employees and patients.“As health care leaders in our communities, it is important we set the standard to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Sistrunk said. “Our goal is to ensure the safest possible work environment for our co-workers and patients while also being a part of the effort to stop the spread of the virus in the communities we serve.”Both Pfizer and Moderna have applied to the Food and Drug Administration for full approval of their COVID-19 vaccines, which is expected soon, hospital officials said.

The data is clear. Vaccination is key to saving lives,” said Dr. John Mohart, Mercy’s senior vice president of clinical services.Officials with CoxHealth were asked about the vaccination rate among employees during a news conference held Tuesday to discuss the delta variant’s impact on patient loads and staffing needs.CoxHealth is based in Springfield and operates six hospitals and several clinics across hard-hit southwest Missouri.About 62.5% of CoxHealth staff — or 7,000 employees — are vaccinated, officials said. Since the rollout of the vaccines, none of those who got the shots have been admitted to the hospital with COVID-19.“That’s a pretty strong case to get vaccinated,” said Dr. Nana Gaisie, medical director of employee health for CoxHealth.The rates among employees vary according to education levels, officials said. About 92% of physicians are vaccinated, while rates are as low as 40% among jobs requiring only a high school diploma.Across Springfield’s Greene County, just 38% of residents have initiated vaccination, state data shows. Most of the surrounding counties are below 30%.CoxHealth has recently seen more children hospitalized with COVID-19, said Dr. Kofi Asare-Bawuah, the health system’s pediatrics medical director.Since June 21, the health system has cared for nine pediatric COVID-19 patients, when previously the system would see two to four a month, Asare-Bawuah said. The youngest was just over a week old, and the oldest was 18.“The ones admitted are sicker than those we had previously admitted,” the doctor said. They needed more help with getting enough oxygen.“It’s important that community members do everything possible to protect themselves and each other, regardless of vaccination status. It is especially important to help protect those who cannot get vaccinated, specifically children under the age of 12,” read the public health advisory issued Wednesday by Columbia-Boone County Public Health and Human Services.Health officials in Jefferson, St. Louis and St. Louis County  as area cases and hospitalizations show upward trends.In Boone County, nearly 51% of residents have initiated vaccination, but it still falls short of the 70% estimated to achieve herd immunity and slow the spread of virus.“Talk to your friends and family about the importance of getting the vaccine,” the advisory stated. “For parents of children younger than 12 who can’t be vaccinated, the best way to protect your child is to make sure the adults around them are vaccinated.”BJC HealthCare and Washington University on June 15 were the first major institutions in the St. Louis region to announce COVID-19 vaccine requirements, setting a Sept. 15 deadline for employees.St. Luke’s Hospital made a similar announcement on June 25, with an Aug. 13 deadline. SSM Health came next on June 28, with employees having to be fully vaccinated by the end of September.Updated at 6:15 p.m.A number of other states have tried to boost vaccination rates amid the pandemic.Anybody mischaracterizing the federal outreach effort is ‘doing a disservice to the country,’ says Jeff Zients, White House COVID-19 response coordinator.Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/stltoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/2f/12f4dd95-0807-5615-a80a-7141b257f2bb/60e5e49cbb259.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C817
"‘Stillwater’: Matt Damon Tears Up During Standing Ovation At Palais Premiere – Cannes - Deadline
In town for the world premiere of out-of-competition Cannes Film Festival entry Stillwater, star Matt Damon appeared moved by emotion during a near-five-minute standing ovation tonight. The drama, directed by Spotlight Oscar-winner Tom McCarthy, brought the assembled crowd to its feet in the Grand Théâtre Lumière as the lights came up on film’s team, and brought tears to Damon’s eyes.Stillwater centers on Damon’s Bill Baker, an Oklahoma oil-rig roughneck with a shoddy past as a father who heads to Marseille, hellbent on freeing his daughter (Abigail Breslin), an exchange student imprisoned for murdering her girlfriend, a crime she says she didn’t commit. He’s the proverbial fish out of water who finds an ally in a local single mother (Camille Cottin) and her daughter (Lilou Siauvaud). 








Given the film is largely set in Marseille, just about a two-hour drive from Cannes, the local crowd was particularly keyed in to certain references. And McCarthy further charmed the audience when he was asked to say a few words. Starting off his thank yous in French, he then added of the impromptu speech, “I didn’t prepare my French. I’m overwhelmed to be here. I have been so greatly influenced by the cinema of this country and of Europe. It has had a huge impact on my career and life. To be here is a dream come true.”The Stillwater screenplay is from McCarthy & Marcus Hinchey and Thomas Bidegain & Noé Debré.

"Meet the open-source software powering NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter - Phys.org
When NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter hovered above the Red Planet April 19 on its maiden voyage, the moment was hailed as the first instance of powered, controlled flight on another planet. Figuring out how to fly on Mars, where the air is thin but gravity is about a third of that on Earth, took years of work. Along with the challenge of developing a craft that was up to the task, the mission needed software to make the unprecedented flights possible.

                                         
                                                  





So they turned to F Prime, a reusable, multi-mission flight software framework designed for CubeSats, small spacecraft, and instruments. The program was initially developed in 2013 by a team led by Tim Canham at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California with the aim of creating a low-cost, portable, pliable software architecture option that would allow components written for one application to be reused easily in other applications and run on a range of processors.
In 2017, the team pushed for F Prime to be released as open-source, meaning anyone could freely access the software's source code, allowing external collaborators, universities, and the general public to use the framework on their own projects. It is one of hundreds of codes NASA makes available to the public for free, both as open-source or through its software catalog.
""F Prime has enabled a lot of goals we've had at JPL to design a truly reusable multi-mission flight architecture with the added bonus of the open-source collaboration and visibility afforded by the Mars Helicopter project,"" Canham said. ""It's kind of an open-source victory, because we're flying an open-source operating system and an open-source flight software framework, and flying commercial parts that you can buy off the shelf, if you wanted to do this yourself someday."" (The helicopter carries a combination of custom-made and off-the-shelf components—many from the world of cell phone technology—including its two cameras.)

Frame rate is 3.3 frames per second until Ingenuity began its final descent to the surface, at which point it collected a frame every two seconds. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech
Before Ingenuity, F Prime (also written as F') had already been put through its spacecraft paces, operating successfully aboard the ISS RapidScat scatterometer instrument on the International Space Station since 2014 and JPL's ASTERIA CubeSat in 2017. Looking forward, F Prime is scheduled to run on projects including NASA's Lunar Flashlight CubeSat, which will look for surface ice in the Moon's craters; the agency's Near-Earth Asteroid Scout CubeSat, which will map an asteroid; and potentially JPL's Ocean Worlds Life Surveyor instrument, which would help search for water-based life in our solar system.






Aadil Rizvi, flight software lead for Lunar Flashlight and NEA Scout at JPL, says F Prime provides an out-of-the-box solution for several flight software services, such as commanding, telemetry, parameters, and sequencing for the spacecraft. There's also a sort of ""auto-coding"" tool that makes F Prime highly portable for use across missions.
""This makes it quite easy to drop in a software component from something like Mars Helicopter into another mission's flight software such as Lunar Flashlight or make the component available for open-source use by anyone else using F Prime,"" Rizvi said. ""And it's pretty cool that a significant portion of software used on the Mars Helicopter is identical to software on another spacecraft going to the Moon, or an asteroid, or sitting on a student's desk.""
Universities See the Benefits of F Prime
Since its open-source debut, F Prime has gradually begun gaining traction as a useful flight software option for university and student projects.
At Georgia Tech, a team has incorporated F Prime in its GT1 CubeSat, aimed to serve as an education exercise that will carry an interactive and automatic amateur radio payload.
""We chose F Prime after evaluating a handful of flight software frameworks, including the option of writing our own from scratch,"" said Sterling Peet, Georgia Tech research faculty member and software lead for GT1. ""We don't have the resources to build all this code from scratch, use, and test it to ensure the necessary levels of reliability in-house. But by using F Prime, we can leverage the legacy it has and also contribute our testing and related benefits back to the F Prime community and project.""
A Carnegie Mellon University student-led team chose F Prime to run its Iris Lunar Rover, a tiny robot designed to prove the feasibility of nano-rovers in planetary exploration. ""It was a viable option with a direct link to the creators, so we decided to use it ourselves,"" said Iris Deputy Program Manager Raewyn Duvall.
F Prime will control the rover while recording data and monitoring its health.
""The fact that it is open-source gave us a wide range of examples to base our own modules and let us use the forum to get quick answers without having to worry about potential support service charges just to get answers to questions we may have had,"" Duvall said.
JPL Small Scale Flight Software Group Supervisor Jeff Levison sees university partnerships like the ones with Georgia Tech and Carnegie Mellon as a two-way street: JPL provides world-leading flight systems expertise to budding engineers, and then down the line, those future engineers could end up bringing their talents and a working understanding of F Prime to start a career at JPL.
""F Prime is not an easy architecture to pick up, so a student who manages to master it and create a solid working project clearly has amazing potential for an organization like JPL,"" said Carnegie Mellon's Duvall. ""Many of our students working on Iris that learned F Prime have expressed interest in applying to JPL, which I believe proves F Prime's worth as a recruitment tool.""

Large satellites used for TV broadcasting could be quickly and easily repurposed as asteroid deflectors if a space rock were to threaten Earth, according to a study by the European aerospace company Airbus. The study, part of a mission concept called Fast Kinetic Deflection (FastKD), was commissioned by the European Space Agency (ESA), as part of its effort to prepare for an apocalyptic scenario that will certainly happen one day (even though that day might be in a very distant future).Telecommunication satellites that sit in the so-called geostationary orbit at the altitude of 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) circle Earth at a speed that matches the rotation of the planet, thus appearing permanently suspended above a certain region. These satellites are usually very large, like a small bus. They might weigh 4 to 6 tons, which would give them enough force to affect the trajectory of an approaching space rock. Still, as Albert Falke, who led the FastKD study at Airbus, told Space.com, it would require maybe 10 such spacecraft hitting a 1,000-foot-wide (300 meters) asteroid within a short period of time to sufficiently change its trajectory to avoid the planet. Related: ""These telecommunication platforms, in addition to being large and heavy, are also built with quite a high frequency,"" Falke said. ""That means we can expect them to be available readily in the integration facilities [of satellite manufacturers]. That's something we can take for granted.""In 2019, for example, 15 geostationary satellites were ordered by commercial satellite operators worldwide, according to SpaceNews.In the scenario explored by Airbus, if astronomers detect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth, all satellite manufacturers around the world will have to start converting the telecoms satellites they are currently building into anti-asteroid weapons. All of these missions would have to launch within about one month to reach the asteroid at about the same time.The combined effect of the satellites crashing into the Earthbound rock may change its trajectory by only an inch or two, but that would be enough to nudge it off course and prevent a disaster if done long enough before the expected impact. ""The bottleneck [for the success of such a mission] will be the rockets,"" Falke said. ""We think we could expect about 10 to 15 launches available within one month around the entire globe.""Airbus chose available technology instead of building a new spacecraft completely from scratch for one simple reason: Astronomers may only spot an not that long in advance. The deflection mission might take anywhere between six to 18 months to reach its target, which might leave only about six months for the engineers to make the craft ready. "" has very much improved over the last decades,"" Falke said. ""There are huge observation programs, mostly pushed by NASA. So all the big asteroids, 1 km (0.6 miles) in size and larger should be known. But of course, there are some which could not be observed in the past because their orbits are six to eight years, and their last close approach may have been before these telescopes were put in place,"" he added.It is theoretically possible for a threatening asteroid to be spotted tomorrow, with only months left before a devastating encounter with Earth, Falke added. Some smaller bodies, such as the 2013 Chelyabinsk asteroid, which triggered a shockwave that injured about 1,200 people in Russia, may arrive completely unnoticed.To be able to execute an Earth-saving mission in orbit, telecommunication satellites would have to be fitted with a special module that enables communication in deep space, as well as navigation and guidance required to approach the asteroid. These modules have yet to be developed. Ideally, they would be built and tested in advance and stand ready in case of an emergency.""We do need to have concrete plans on how to make this deflection module and put it on the telecommunications platform,"" Falke said. ""Then we need to perform very fast qualification and test activity before putting this deflection system on the launch pad.""Humankind, according to Falke, should want to be prepared. If a 1,000-foot-wide (300 m) asteroid, such as that envisioned in the Airbus study, hit somewhere in central Europe, it would cause widespread destruction across the whole continent. ""Such an impact would produce a shockwave and also firestorms and earthquakes,"" Falke said. ""A lot of material would be thrown up into the atmosphere and then come down further away from the impact zone. I think the whole of Europe would have to be evacuated and all the flora and fauna would be destroyed in the months and years after such an impact.""Falke is cautious to say whether an asteroid larger than 1,000 feet (300 m) in diameter could still be deflected using this method. But that's an important question. The asteroid that led to the  some 60 million years ago is believed to have been at least 6 miles (9.6 km) in diameter. ""If the asteroid becomes larger [than 1,000 feet], it gets more difficult,"" Falke said. ""But the good thing is that such big objects will be known a very long time in advance so we would have time to prepare.""Humankind seems to be in a better position than the dinosaurs. The world's first asteroid deflection experiment is set to take place next year when a NASA mission called DART is expected to ram into a small asteroid moon Dimorphos, which orbits a larger asteroid Didymos. The goal is to change the orbit of 520-foot-wide (160 m) Didymos with a 270-pound (600 kilograms) spacecraft.The study results were presented at the Planetary Defence Conference 2021Follow Tereza Pultarova on Twitter @TerezaPultarova.

Sea otters are a hardy lot.

                                         
                                                  





The smallest of all marine mammals with the thickest fur of the animal kingdom, they can hold their breath for up to eight minutes while they dive for prey like clams and crabs, which they're known to crack open using rocks.
An enduring mystery, however, was just how the mustelids manage to stay warm in the chilly waters of their Pacific habitat, bereft of the blubber that insulates seals, whales and walruses.
The answer, according to a new paper published in the journal Science on Thursday, is a unique energy conversion system whereby their muscle tissue ""leak"" large amounts of heat throughout their bodies.
That's unlike other mammals, which have to put their muscles to work through exercise, or involuntary shivering, to achieve the same result.
Lead author Traver Wright of Texas A&M University told AFP that while sea otters' dense, water-resistant fur offsets some heat loss, it isn't enough by itself to cope with the frigid waters off Alaska, where most of them reside.
Scientists already knew the sea otters burn a lot of energy—approximately three times greater than predicted for mammals of their size, and to keep up with the demand, they may consume up to 25 percent of their body mass in a day.





                Canadian sea otters swim on June 5, 2012 in the zoo of Amneville, eastern France.
             


It was unclear, though, which tissues were making use of this energy and how it was going towards producing heat.
To find out, Wright and colleagues took muscle samples from sea otters that were already dead, or, more happily, had been rehabilitated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and were being prepared for release.
They then used a device to measure oxygen consumption.
'Making heat by being inefficient'
The main function of muscles is generally to be able to move the body, but in the otters, much of the metabolic energy produced by breaking down sugars and fats was lost as heat instead of being used by mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, to do work such as powering muscle contraction.
This effect had been predicted for polar animals, but was observed for the first time in sea otters in the new paper.
""One of the interesting things that we found is that they're really good at making heat by being inefficient,"" said Wright.

The team found that this ""thermogenesic"" effect was present in sea otters from the time they were babies to adults, and there was no difference in captive and wild-raised animals.
Sea otters and marine mammals more broadly might have evolved such traits when their terrestrial ancestors began taking to the oceans 50 million years ago, but that hypothesis will require more research to confirm.
Learning how sea otters' metabolic system functions differently from ours could one day also help humans solve obesity issues, added Wright.
""If you can figure out how to increase the leak and metabolic rate, you could theoretically have humans revving up the metabolism and burning off additional calories.""

Today@filipeespositoEvery day, more rumors suggest that Apple will indeed introduce new, redesigned MacBook Pro models later this year. In a new research note obtained by 9to5Mac, reliable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reinforces that new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros will enter mass production in the third quarter of 2021.
The analyst suggests that the company is ready to start production of the next generation MacBook Pro in the coming months, which will be available in a new 14-inch and 16-inch form-factor. According to Kuo, Apple has been investing in more Mini-LED display suppliers as it plans to adopt the technology in more products, including the new MacBook Pro.Apple’s first device with a Mini-LED display was the 12.9-inch iPad Pro introduced earlier this year. For those unfamiliar, Mini-LED relies on thousands of really small LEDs in the backlight, which results in higher contrast ratios and deeper blacks, similar to OLED.Based on previous rumors (including other reports from Kuo), the new MacBook Pro will have a “flat-edged design” similar to what we’ve seen in the latest iMac, iPad Pro, and iPhone 12 designs. Apple also plans to bring back more ports to its laptop Pro, such as HDMI, SD card slot, and even MagSafe. This machine is also expected to have a more powerful M1X chip, the first evolution of Apple Silicon in Macs since M1.The MacBook Pro is not the only one that will have a Mini-LED display. Kuo’s latest report also mentions that Apple wants to adopt the same technology in the next generation MacBook Air. However, that should only be announced sometime in 2022.Earlier this week, leaker DylanDkt said that the new MacBook Air will likely be the first with an M2 chip (not the M1X, which will have a more advanced GPU focused on the Pro lineup). Dylan also heard that the new MacBook Air will be available in multiple colors, just like the new iMac. However, it’s unknown when exactly this new MacBook Air will be introduced.",https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/M1-MacBook-Pro.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1500,"Nintendo's OLED Switch is the right move, just not for you - CNET
Not so. The . Actually, I don't know what it's called. Switch OLED? Switch with OLED? Regardless, as the name -- whatever it is -- suggests, its main improvement is the OLED display. It'll be 0.8-inches bigger than the regular Switch's 6.2-inch screen, with deeper blacks and better contrast. Other touted features include an improved kickstand and ""enhanced audio."" In other words, it's anything but a generational leap. These modest improvements come with a modest price hike. The Switch Deluxe launches at $350 on Oct. 8, at just $50 more than the Non OLED Switch.That seems fair, but . That's because, like me, it appears most people anticipated more. An upgraded Nintendo Switch was first reported by Bloomberg some 11 months ago -- long enough for imaginations flourish and expectations to soar. Coming in September! Nintendo Switch CRT version! @NeonNinja225 Nintendo Switch vs Nintendo Switch OLED And those inflated expectations are the issue here -- not the New and Slightly Improved Switch. If it was a surprise announcement, gamers would have met the new edition with a polite ""fair enough."" It's only against hopes of substantial hardware improvements, and existing owners wanting a decent reason to upgrade, that the reaction becomes ""Nintendo ruined everything again!"" Don't get me wrong. If I had it my way, Nintendo would have announced a Switch Pro with 4K resolution, a new graphics chip and better battery life. I'd also, and its lack of native bluetooth support -- which is absurd at this point. But with the Nintendo SWOLED, Nintendo isn't trying to get my dollar. There are millions of people who care about 4K gaming, but  that don't. Nintendo is after that second group.The NintendOLED Switch makes sense for a few reasons. First, Nintendo isn't yet interested in the Switch 2 or anything resembling a next-generation console. Doug Bowser, Nintendo America's hilariously named president, told Polygon in December that we're at around the ""midpoint"" of the Switch's lifecycle. Since the Switch has sold more units each year -- 15 million in 2017's financial year, 17 million in 2018, 20 million in 2019, 26 million in 2020 -- Nintendo rightly sees that it doesn't need to do anything drastic with the console's hardware. A gentle nudge, like a bigger and clearer display, should keep the money flowing. This is the company's modus operandi. Do you remember the 3DS XL, the DS Lite, and the Game Boy Advance SP? Of course you do! They were awesome. But don't forget the 2DS, the 2DS XL, the DSi, DSi XL, the backlit Game Boy Advance SP and the Game Boy Advance Micro -- which Nintendo released almost a year after the original DS. ""Extend Console Lifespan with Iterative Models"" isn't catchy, but it's the name of the game. Like all of the aforementioned renovated models, the OLED Switch has two goals. It serves diehard fans, numbering in the millions, who flock to buy any new Nintendo console. Second, and more importantly, it provides an extra option to people who haven't bought a Switch yet.  The console has sold over 84 million units since 2017, about 16 million shy of becoming the best-selling Nintendo home console ever. But the company isn't scraping the barrel for more buys, as there are hundreds of millions of potential sales yet to be realized, and it's these to whom Nintendo are appealing by adding to the Switch hardware range. It's a push for those who've been on the fence since 2017, or those who have rekindled their love of gaming during the pandemic. It'll also help build hype for Metroid Dread, , as well as . So horribly disappointed with the new Nintendo Switch OLED specs & lack of improvements. Anyone know where I can preorder?I could be fanboying here, but I’m so prepared to snatch that OLED Nintendo Switch. The current Switch is from launch day 2017. It’s been beaten to death from all the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate grinds. Not only do I want those white Joy-Cons, it launches in my Birthday week! 3+ million views on YouTube already for Switch OLED, 156k Likes, 91% Like Ratio and #1 Trending all dayWhile this isn't getting received super well in the hardcore gaming community there seems to a be a lot more positive sentiment and interest among the general audience The company's calculus appears as follows: Switch OLED + Metroid Dead x holiday sales multiplier = a Merry Christmas for Nintendo. I suspect the math will check out. Nintendo has always prized accessibility over technical prowess, which is how the Wii, DS and 3DS all became huge successes. I suspect Nintendo will eventually create a 4K-capable console when it can do so cheaply enough to sell it for under $400 -- by which time Sony and Microsoft will already be onto 8K. It's not a bad strategy. When my friend texted me for Switch advice -- something she's unlikely to do ever again -- she decided against waiting to buy her partner a newer, more powerful Switch.  ""Do you have a 4K TV? Does he care about 4K graphics?,"" I asked.

"What we know about the 2 Americans detained in Haiti president's assassination - New York Post
Two Haitian-Americans with ties to South Florida — including one who previously worked as a bodyguard at the Canadian Embassy in Haiti — are among the 28 alleged assassins of President Jovenel Moïse, officials announced Thursday.James Solages, 35, and Vincent Joseph, 55, allegedly took part in the , who was reportedly shot a dozen times at his Port-au-Prince home on Wednesday, officials said. His wife, Martine, was critically wounded.The two men were paraded along with 15 other suspects, all Colombia nationals, in front of journalists during a press conference late Thursday. In all, the hit squad comprised 28 gunmen, including 26 Colombians, officials said.Despite the Haitian authorities’ display of the American suspects, who sat near two tables filled with firearms, machetes, bulletproof vests and cell phones, their alleged involvement in the deadly plot was shrouded in mystery.It was unclear why the Haitian government believes they were involved, how long they had been in the country, how and when they got there, or even what their motive was, the Miami Herald reported.US officials said they are aware of the accusations against American citizens, but could not comment about the allegations due to privacy concerns, according to the newspaper.It was confirmed late Thursday that Solages had once worked for a company that contracted to provide security for the Canadian Embassy in Port-au-Prince, the Herald reported.“We are aware of allegations implicating an individual who was briefly employed as a reserve bodyguard by a security company hired by Global Affairs Canada in 2010,” a government official told the paper on condition of anonymity because of the volatile situation in Haiti.Solages, who lived in Tamarac, a Florida city in the Fort Lauderdale area, does not have a criminal record, according to the Herald, which cited divorce proceedings in the US but no other legal matters.His aunt, Victorie Dorisme, told the paper that she learned about the allegations against him from Haitian TV — and is puzzled about how the South Florida maintenance worker became a suspected international assassin.“I’ve never heard of him in any trouble like this,” Dorisme told the Herald, adding that Solages had his mail forwarded to her address while changing homes because of his divorce.She said he divided his time between his job as a building maintenance worker and running a small charity.Solages described himself on his charity website as a “certified diplomatic agent” and former bodyguard for the Canadian Embassy in Haiti — but that website appears to have stopped working, the paper reported, adding that calls and emails to the charity were not returned.In a statement, Canada’s foreign relations department did not refer to Solages by name but said one of the men detained in the assassination had been “briefly employed as a reserve bodyguard” at its embassy by a private contractor.Solages’ Facebook page, now taken down, said he attended Fort Lauderdale High School, according to the news outlet.Between 2015 and 2018, he went on to study at Atlantic Technical College in Coconut Creek and later Florida Career College, where he said he earned an associate degree in information technology, the Herald said, citing his social media page.Solages — who said he is originally from the port town of Jacmel on Haiti’s southern coast — had a Florida-registered business called FWA SA A JACMEL AVAN INC, which he described on LinkedIn as an economic empowerment charity, according to the paper.He also has a business — EJS Maintenance & Repair LLC — with two other Haitian men, who also are affiliated with the charity, the Herald said, citing Florida corporate records. His LinkedIn page also describes him as the CEO of the remodeling company.“Experienced building engineer specialize in infrastructure, Equipment, HAVC, Painting with a demonstrated history of working in the hospital & health care industry,” he wrote on his LinkedIn page.“Skilled in Customer Service, Strategic Planning, budgeting, Team Building, Leadership, Public Speaking, and Training,” he added.He listed Spanish, English, French and Haitian Creole as languages he speaks. His Facebook page recently showed him wearing a business suit, and he posted some images of armored vehicles, the paper reported.The LinkedIn page now lists him as a plant operations manager in Lantana, about 40 miles north of Fort Lauderdale, for a company called Senior Lifestyle, which runs senior communities nationwide.In Lantana, it operates the Carlisle Palm Beach, which describes itself as “an upscale resort-style senior living option.” Workers there declined to tell the Herald whether Solages is employed there.Meanwhile, virtually nothing is known about Joseph, who Haitian authorities said lives in or at one time lived in Miami.  Share Selection",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/road-trip-002.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=200&crop=1,"‘We don’t like bullies, egomaniacs or jerks’: Allen West crashes Texas governor’s race - POLITICO

					HELENA Mont. — A tiny western Montana town where a grizzly bear pulled a woman from her tent and killed her this week welcomes visitors year-round to the mountain valley community along the banks of a river made famous by the movie “A River Runs Through It.”They come to Ovando to fish, hike, camp and float the river in the summer and to snowmobile, cross country ski or snow shoe in the winter.The warmer months also bring bicyclists traversing the scenic Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, which this year runs nearly 2,500 miles (4,023 kilometers) from northern Montana to southern New Mexico.A break in the long-anticipated ride on that route is what brought Leah Davis Lokan, 65, of Chico, California, to the town on Monday for an overnight stay, her friends said.She and her party were camped near the town’s post office and museum when a grizzly bear pulled her out of her tent and killed her early Tuesday, officials said. It was the second time the bear was at the campsite that night, they said.Wildlife officials spent Thursday trying to find and kill the approximately 400-pound (181-kilogram) bear, but came up empty for a third straight day.The sheriff closed the informal campsites around town at least until Sunday and the town opened up a fire station and church for cyclists to sleep inside. The town already had an old jail that had been remodeled with some cots for campers, said Kathleen Loendoerfer, who owns the Blackfoot Angler fishing shop with her husband, Travis Thurmond.Ovando sees about 1,000 cyclists per year who are traveling the Great Divide route, Schoendoerfer estimated, with varying numbers staying overnight.The route loosely follows the Continental Divide, at times zig-zagging over it on gravel roads, dirt roads and trails and some single tracks, said Dillon Key, who works at Great Divide Cyclery in Helena. There are also some highway miles.The route is “absolutely gorgeous” through Montana, taking riders over mountain passes and through big, open meadows, Key said.“A lot of the towns on the route, small towns in the middle of the mountains, tend to be really welcoming to divide riders coming through,” Key said. “There’s a couple farms and ranches along the way that allow riders to come stay with them. It’s kind of a communal feeling to it. Everyone’s really welcoming.”Lokan, a registered nurse who had worked at a hospital in Chico, California, would have fit right in, said Mike Castaldo, president of the Chico Cycling Club.“She had a really good spirit. She always had a smile on her face. Always lit up when she saw you. Always gave you a big hug,” said Castaldo, who knew Lokan for about 15 years. “But I think most of her identity was, you know, outside on the bike, enjoying the outdoors was her thing.”She participated in mountain bike races and was a road cyclist and experienced outdoorswoman.“I think she was competitive, but that was secondary to the journey or the adventure she was on that particular day,” he said Thursday.Lokan had been looking forward to the Montana bike trip for months, said Mary Flowers, another friend from Chico. Lokan had taken long-distance bike trips and on this one was accompanied by her sister and a friend, Flowers said.“She was talking about her summer plans — this wonderful wild adventure, riding her bike on, I don’t know, a 400-mile trip or something,” Flowers said. “A woman in her 60s, and she’s doing this kind of stuff — she had a passion for life that was out of the ordinary.”Another friend remembered Lokan as a free spirit with many friends.“She always greeted you with a smile. She was one of those people that was always up for an adventure and always made you to feel like you were the center of her attention at all times,” said Leesa Stefano, who met Lokan when Stefano moved to Sandpoint, Idaho, in 2006 and got involved in a bicycling club to which Lokan belonged.Stefano said Lokan was the type of person who would find a way to check in with everyone at some point to make sure friends knew they were still part of her life.“We were all really excited for her, because we know what it meant,” Stefano said about the bike ride. “We couldn’t wait to hear the stories. It’s considered an epic ride.”Lokan and two others were camping when a bear startled them at 3 a.m. Tuesday before wandering off, Montana wildlife officials said. The bicyclists removed food from their tents, stored it and went back to sleep, officials said.About 4:15 a.m., the sheriff’s office received a 911 call after two people in a tent near the victim’s were awakened by sounds of the attack, Powell County Sheriff Gavin Roselles said. They discharged their bear spray, and the bear ran away.Lokan was “well versed in what she was doing. She knew the dangers,” Castaldo said, suggesting she may have let her guard down while camping in a town, rather than along the trail.“The fact that it was right in town — that’s pretty messed up,” Thurmond told the Missoulian.People who camp in grizzly bear country — whether deep in the woods or in a developed campground — are advised to keep food and scented products like toothpaste away from their campsites at all times and to cook elsewhere.If a bear comes through a campsite, it’s important to stay on lookout for the animal to return, said Greg Lemon, spokesperson for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.Wildlife officials initially used helicopter flights to search for the grizzly. They also set up large traps — made out of culverts and baited with roadkill — in and around Ovando. That included traps near a chicken coop that the bear raided the night Lokan was killed, as well as near the campsite.Investigators obtained DNA left by the bear in the attack and could compare it with any bruin they are able to trap. Bear specialists and game wardens also were stationed near the traps to shoot the animal if the opportunity arises, said Greg Lemon, spokesperson for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.“Our best chance would be if the bear comes back and tries to get another chicken or some more food around town,” Lemon said.The wardens feel they could easily identify the bear, which was recorded on a store’s surveillance camera in the minutes after its first visit to Lokan’s campsite, Lemon said.“If they saw that bear at the trap and had a clear shot at it, they might choose to do that.”___Brown reported from Billings.Related Articles
