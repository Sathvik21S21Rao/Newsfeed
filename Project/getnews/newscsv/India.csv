"PV Sindhu faces high hurdles on way to Tokyo podium - The Indian Express
No PV Sindhu medal is complete without matching wits with the Japanese, and the Tokyo Olympics stars have aligned to pit her against Akane Yamaguchi in a potential quarterfinal. Should seedings stick to script, World No 7 Sindhu would be up against the home contender in the Last 8.The last time they met, Sindhu beat Yamaguchi – almost a foot shorter, but twice busier – in three sets at the All England. It was a significant result in what was the Indian’s best fighting match of 2021. Downing the un-tiring Yamaguchi who retrieves endlessly and can still sneak in the offensive punch in her back-bending smashes, Sindhu had secured the confidence-booster in the early season at Birmingham.Like she has been accustomed to, throughout her successful sojourns at the Majors, the reward for downing Yamaguchi could be an even more treacherous opponent – the deceptive dazzler, Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei or the older talent-oozing Intanon Ratchanok.Sindhu’s half is littered with shuttlers searching for their own big medals – with the Indian having played a part in denying them glory in past competitions. Tai Tzu alone was hassled out of the Rio Olympics and knocked out of the 2019 World Championships by Sindhu. As such, Sindhu will run into dangerously unfulfilled ambitions of shuttlers for whom Tokyo will be the last-chance saloon.The other half of the draw has Chinese Chen Yufei, He Bingjiao, Korean An Se Young and gold-favourite Nozomi Okuhara.Beware of the startA gold medal, by definition, demands you prove your might against anyone else in the draw – and Sindhu has a couple of tricky potential hurdles even before she squares off against Yamaguchi (possibly) in the quarters. The Indian is clubbed in Group J with Hong Kong’s Cheung Ngan Yi, whose acrobatic defense and deception from the back, cannot be easily ignored.Denmark’s Mia Blichfeldt was easily set aside earlier in March but can be particularly pugnacious. This Round of 16 opponent should keep her on her toes.Great wall of MomotaB Sai Praneeth needed to avoid Viktor Axelsen and top-ranked Kento Momota of Japan early. The draw has been nastily unkind. Should he get past dangerous floaters Misha Zilberman and Mark Caljouw from Group D, Sai has NG Long ka Angus of Hong Kong, a hectic opponent who fancies his chances against Indians.Momota’s nerves while trying to win Japan it’s first-ever gold in the home Games can be exploited. Whether Sai Praneeth can summon the belief needed to pierce through the most indestructible defense aiming at gold in Tokyo, remains to be seen.At the 2019 World’s where Sai won India’s first men’s singles bronze in 26 years, he was beaten 21-13, 21-8 by Momota. Two months later, things got even more dire with a 21-6 scoreline at Denmark. But no one said Olympic medals came easy.Rough draw for Satwik-ChiragIndia’s men’s doubles pairing of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty have a punishing group-stage to negotiate. It’s Sanhok-level of difficulty, for the PUBG lovers.As if being bunched with World No 1 Kevin Sukamuljo – Marcus Gideon – the busybody ‘Minions’ of Indonesia wasn’t enough, there is Lee Yang – Wang Chi Lin of Chinese Taipei, who set the Thailand tournaments on fire in January, throbbing to win in the same A Group.British Ben Lane – Sean Vendy, picked ahead of their higher ranked compatriots – who won bronze at Rio and are in the middle of a spat of a selection blowout right now, will have a point to prove too.Expected to be the surprise package of the Olympics for the country chasing its third successive Games medal, the Indians have a nasty, chaotic surprise of their own, to get off the mark. Satwik loves to smash his way out of these minefields typically rather than grind out. The Olympic draw though, might leave him with no choice now but to dial up the aggression.

New York: Pfizer Inc. plans to request U.S. emergency authorization in August for a third booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine, based on early data showing that it can sharply increase immune protection against the coronavirus.At the same time, however, federal health officials signaled that they would take a cautious approach to potential booster shots, and underlined that the currently available vaccines are effective at keeping people from being sickened by the coronavirus.Pfizer has received initial data from an early human study showing that a third dose of its existing coronavirus vaccine is safe and can raise neutralizing antibody levels by 5 to 10 fold compared with the original vaccine, the company’s research head, Mikael Dolsten, said in an interview.Once more data is in hand, Pfizer plans to ask the FDA to authorize a booster shot that could be given six to eight months after the original two doses, Dolsten said. The drugmaker is also talking with regulators in other countries and the European Union about the new results, he said. Pfizer produces the vaccine in partnership with BioNTech SE.The statement stressed that available vaccines are effective and that nearly all people hospitalized and dying from the virus currently are unvaccinated — a message that signals a fear that Pfizer’s announcement could fuel brewing doubts about vaccines broadly.“Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at this time,” the agencies said in the statement. “We are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed.”Dolsten said the company is going public with its plans because the early data looks convincing and because of increasing concern about mutations of the virus, including the ultra-transmissible delta variant that is spreading in numerous countries.“There is a lot of fear and concern” about variants, Dolsten said. “We are confident that such a boost will be highly effective against the delta variant.”While the antibody results are based on a small initial cohort of roughly 10 to 20 people who received the booster, Dolsten said that the “the data set is so clear we have complete confidence that the full study will reproduce this.”Also read: Messenger RNA vaccines provide powerful protection against severe Covid-19, including cases caused by the delta strain, but there have been signs of breakthrough cases. A British study in May, for example, found the Pfizer shot was 88% effective in preventing symptomatic disease from the delta variant after the second dose.More recent data released by Israel this month found that Pfizer’s efficacy had dropped to 64% since the delta variant took over there, even as it was 93% effective at keeping people out of the hospital.Dolsten said Pfizer interprets the Israeli finding as a sign that blood-antibody levels have faded somewhat since people in Israel started being vaccinated in January and February. In the presence of a highly transmissible strain, that may allow mild cases to slip through even though people remain protected against severe disease, he said.Even when front-line antibodies have faded slightly, the vaccine still produces a variety of memory responses that can stave off serious illness, Dolsten said.“When you have low blood levels of an antibody, viruses that are highly contagious may reinfect and cause mild disease,” Dolsten said.Separately, Pfizer plans to begin human trials of a new booster customized against the delta strain. But Dolsten said it was unlikely that this customized vaccine would be needed, as the existing vaccine does a good job of producing antibodies against the variant.Even preventing mild cases can be useful because it will help slow infections that can lead to new variants, and will prevent cases of long Covid that can occur even after mild infections, Dolsten said.In the past, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla has suggested that Covid booster shots might be needed for most people within 12 months, and annual boosters might be necessary after that. But medical experts have cautioned that it isn’t clear whether and when boosters will be needed.With only a small portion of the world vaccinated so far and variants emerging like wildfire, booster shots may be an important way to keep vaccinated parts of the world from having to continually going back to disruptive social distancing measures, Dolsten said.“For the next few years, it is better to be prepared for what seems like a sober reality than to hold for miracles,” he said.The Pfizer shot is one of the leading Covid vaccines globally. As of July 1, Pfizer said it had shipped more than 860 million doses of its vaccine around the world, including over 330 million doses to the EU and over 200 million doses to the U.S.In the U.S., over 184 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been administered so far, outpacing 135 million doses of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine that have been used in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Also read:

"Astronomers Detect Elusive Electron-Capture Supernova for the First Time - The Wire Science
A view of the Crab Nebula composed of data from five observatories. Image: NASASupernovae, or stellar explosions signaling the death of a star, have always fascinated astronomers.When the pandemic began in late 2019, Betelgeuse, a red giant star in the familiar constellation of Orion, suddenly darkened, sending astronomers scrambling for their telescopes. Many speculated that Betelgeuse was about to go supernova. But the dimming had a simpler explanation: condensation of dust in front of the star as seen from Earth.Having put that false alarm behind them, astronomers are excitedly poring over a new study describing the first-ever detection of an electron-capture supernova. Designated SN2018zd, it was discovered in a galaxy 90 million lightyears away by amateur astronomer Koichi Itagaki in 2018, validating a 40-year-old theory about the existence of electron-capture supernovae.Supernovae are stars in their death throes that become extremely hot red-giants, incredibly dense white-dwarfs, even denser neutron stars or finally blink out of existence as black holes, depending on how massive they are. The longevity of a star depends on its mass as it burns its hydrogen fuel to produce energy, which prevents it from collapsing in on itself due to the pull of gravity. The bigger the star, the quicker it dies, as more mass means more heat, and the hotter it gets the faster it uses up its fuel.Temperatures of millions of degrees and high densities deep inside the star force four hydrogen atoms to fuse into one helium atom. In the process, 0.7% of the mass is converted into energy. (Albert Einstein famously summed this up in his equation, that energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared). In the Sun, for instance, 600 million tonnes of hydrogen are converted to helium every second.At some point, the star’s hydrogen reserves are fully converted to helium and it bloats into a red giant, allowing gravity to take over and ignite new nuclear reactions that convert the helium again into carbon. This continues until all the carbon is turned into oxygen and, eventually, into iron. The fusion of all elements lighter than iron releases more energy than it consumes, but elements from iron on the periodic table can’t be fused without consuming more energy. This is called the iron peak.At this stage, the star’s iron-rich nucleus can no longer produce energy. The star then explodes outwards in a supernova, its brightness spreading millions of lightyears out into space1 and its core gets cloaked by an expanding nebula of ionised gas and dust.Supernovae are classified as ‘thermonuclear’ and ‘iron-core collapse’. Thermonuclear supernovae are produced by collapsing low-mass stars that have up to about eight-times the Sun’s mass. Iron-core collapse supernovae are produced by massive stars with more than ten-times the Sun’s mass, and whose remnants are incredibly dense neutron stars.Also read: In the early 1980s, however, Japanese astrophysicist Kenichi Nomoto theorised that there could also be another type of supernova apart from these two: the electron-capture supernovae.Some stars stop fusion when their cores are made of oxygen, neon and magnesium. They do not have enough mass to produce iron and their core elements cannot fuse into heavier elements to prolong their lives. Instead, a process known as electron-capture smashes some of the electrons in the oxygen-neon-magnesium core into their atomic nuclei. With the electrons removed, the stellar core crumbles under its own weight to start an electron-capture supernova, with a neutron star at its centre.Proof of electron capture supernovae remained elusive, however – until 2018, when Itagaki discovered SN2018zd, which Nomoto has described as “a wonderful case of the combination of observations and theory.”Kenichi Nomoto theorised the existence of a third type of supernova in the 1980s, and called its recent discovery “a wonderful case of the combination of observations and theory.”This significant discovery also points to another electron capture supernova that has been hiding in plain sight for a thousand years: SN 1054, which Asian sky-watchers recorded in 1054 AD! Astronomers have considered it to be a prime example of an electron-capture supernova. It was so bright at the time that it could be seen in daylight for weeks, and at night for a couple of years, before it faded into the Crab Nebula. Its extraordinary luminosity was probably due to ejecta from the supernova colliding with material cast off by the parent star – one of several characteristics that ties in neatly with the recently spotted SN2018zd.Some five billion years ago, in one of the arms of the Milky Way galaxy, the shock waves from an exploding supernova spread heavy elements from the dead star into interstellar space. As the cloud of gas and dust eventually condensed, the resulting nebula began to spin faster and faster2, flattening itself into a disk.Through millions of years, gravity pulled the bulk of this mass towards its centre until the ever-increasing heat and density eventually burst into thermonuclear brilliance: the Sun was born. Around it, scores of elements in the gas and dust formed clumps – proto-planets and their moons that would become the Solar System.1 lightyear is 9.46 trillion km↩To conserve momentum↩Vasudevan Mukunth, editor: mukunth@thewire.inGeneral enquiries: science@thewire.in",https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/852541703957303296/iUcPnpWS_normal.jpg,"Hubble telescope suffers its worst glitch in a decade as Nasa struggles to find a fix - India Today
 The Hubble Space Telescope continues to fly blind nearly 540 kilometers above Earth, three weeks after science operations were shut following a glitch in an onboard computer. Nasa engineers have been working on fixing the school bus-sized flying observatory, which has faced a glitch nearly a decade after it was last repaired.Nasa has now completed a test of procedures that will be used to reboot the payload computer The procedure could be tried on the telescope by next week.""Nasa successfully completed a test of procedures that would be used to switch to backup hardware on Hubble in response to the payload computer problem. This switch could occur next week after further preparations and reviews,"" the Hubble Space Telescope team said.The telescope was last repaired in 2009 after it was first deployed by space shuttle Discovery in 1990., the telescope has faced several glitches which were repaired in time to resume operations, however, the current glitch is taking longer than expected for engineers to pinpoint and send a patch. The telescope earlier encountered problems related to its Imaging Spectrograph that suffered a power failure in 2004, followed by an electrical short in 2007 that affected its Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) — the primary camera for the telescope.Even as engineers struggle to find the exact problem in the hardware, Nasa is confident of solving the issue and resuming science operations. ""The telescope itself and its science instruments remain in good health and are currently in a safe configuration,"" Nasa had said in a statement.Also Read: The faulty payload computer controls and coordinates the science instruments onboard the spacecraft. Following the sudden halt in the module, the computer stopped receiving a “keep-alive” signal, which indicates that all is well. As soon as the fault occurred, the main computer placed all science instruments in a safe-mode configuration.The Hubble Space telescope is a flying observatory in space that was developed by Nasa and the European Space Agency to look beyond the visibility from Earth.

Earth’s two immediate neighbours Mars and Venus will come closest to each other next week. The celestial event is called planetary conjunction. The event will be easily visible with the naked eye. Planetary conjunction takes place when two planets appear to have come closer, while in reality they remain far away.The latest event will take place on July 13 when Venus and Mars will come within just 0.5 degrees of each other. The phenomenon will be visible the horizon under a clear sky soon after sunset or in the western sky. The conjunction will also include the moon drawing close, within 4 degrees of the two planets, on July 12 and create a triple conjunction.While the two planets on either side of the Earth’s orbit will appear to be closest on July 13, the event has already begun with the two being almost, coupled with crescent moon. Observations from July 13 will also reveal the two planets moving away from each other. This will also mark the first of three planetary conjunctions between Venus and Mars with just eight months. Similar sights are likely on February 12 and March 12 next year.The Pune-based Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Indian Institute of Astrophysics in Bengaluru have invited photographs of the event.

Moscow: The long-delayed Russian module for the International Space Station is set to be finally launched this month, but the date has been pushed back several days, the head of the country’s space corporation said Thursday.Roscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin said on Twitter that the Nauka (Science) module is now scheduled to be launched from the Russian launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan on July 21. The following two days could serve as reserve dates for the launch.Russian space officials had earlier said that the launch previously set for July 15 was postponed because of the need to fix some unspecified flaws.The launch of Nauka, also called Multipurpose Laboratory Module, has been repeatedly delayed because of technical problems.It was initially scheduled to go up in 2007. In 2013, experts found contamination in its fuel system, resulting in a long and costly replacement. Other Nauka systems also underwent modernisation or repairs.The 20-metric-ton module is set to be put to orbit by a Proton-M booster rocket. It’s intended to provide Russian astronauts on board the space outpost with their own room and capacity for lab research.Get the news updates on WhatsApp & Telegram by subscribing to our channels.

                                  As per UK scientists, the object dates back to the very beginning of the Solar System, some 4.6 billion years agoThe rocky material that fell to Earth in a fireball over the Cotswold town of Winchcombe in February has had its classification formally accepted.As per UK scientists, the object dates back to the very beginning of the Solar System, some 4.6 billion years ago.
It is now being deemed as extremely valuable. 
As per the formal classification, it was concluded that that the dark grey-to-black material picked up in Gloucestershire earlier this year is now absolutely recognised as being meteoritic in nature. The term ""Winchcombe"" is used to describe it.
It is mostly made up of phyllosilicates, or clays. The H2O is bound up in those minerals.

The theory holds that a bombardment of the parent asteroids of meteorites like Winchcombe could have delivered much of the H20 we now see in our oceans.
Researchers, led by London's Natural History Museum (NHM), say the meteorite, which comprises 548g of small stones and powder, is a member of the CM2 carbonaceous chondrites.
Also, it is said to be ""Mighei-like"", which is a reference to a particular type specimen, or standard, of meteorite that was found in Ukraine in the late 19th Century.
NHM's Dr Ashley King, was quoted by BBC saying, ""Carbonaceous chondrites are probably the oldest and most primitive extra-terrestrial materials we have available to study"".
He added, ""They come from asteroids that formed right back at the start of our Solar System. They're like time capsules. They're telling us about the building blocks of our Solar System. Obviously, we weren't there 4.6 billion years ago, and these meteorites are a way for us to actually see what sort of materials were there, and how those materials started to come together to make the planets"".

"WhatsApp working on image, video quality options - The Siasat Daily
San Francisco: Facebook-owned WhatsApp is working on two new features that might allow users to send images and videos in ‘best quality’.WABetaInfo reported that the two features are currently in development for the Android app and should eventually present three quality options when sending images and videos. The options are ‘Auto’, ‘Best quality’ or ‘Data saver’.There’s currently no word on when the feature may see an official release, and WABetaInfo’s report relates specifically to the Android beta app and not iOS, The Verge reported.But given the feature parity between WhatsApp’s apps, development on iOS is unlikely to be too far behind, it added.Recently, a report said that WhatsApp might soon allow users to choose what video quality will be uploaded when they send someone a video.The new video upload quality feature was first spotted by WABetaInfo and while it’s not active yet, their report confirms that it’s in the works.Choosing the video quality before sending is useful as it means that you can pick the right option to either save bandwidth or share the video without heavy compression.The most anticipated of these is multi-device support, which will allow the service to be usable across multiple devices.The app researcher reported the feature was in development last year and more recently Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed the feature will launch soon.Get the news updates on WhatsApp & Telegram by subscribing to our channels.

People who like moderately large iPads, rejoice: The 11-inch iPad Pro might be getting a mini-LED display next year. This year's crop of iPad Pro devices were split on this matter, as , while the smaller, 11-inch model came out with a good, old, regular LED display. But according to a new note by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo (via MacRumors), Apple's next 11-inch iPad Pro, due to be launched in 2022, will have a mini-LED display as well. Kuo added that Apple plans to launch a MacBook Air with a mini-LED display, also next year. Finally,  of the upcoming 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro devices, also with mini-LED displays, in the third quarter of the year. , it'll be nice to see them actually, finally launch. Also if you're keeping count, all of this would mean that, by the end of next year, basically all of Apple's laptops and high-end tablets will come with mini-LED displays. The mini-LED display does make a difference, with its numerous (duh) miniature LEDs that create local dimming zones for better contrast and peak brightness.

"WhatsApp says privacy policy on hold till enactment of data privacy law - The Indian Express
WhatsApp on Friday told the Delhi High Court it would not limit the functionality of its messaging app in case a user does not consent to its latest privacy policy, and will maintain the approach at least till the forthcoming data protection Bill comes into effect. The Centre had earlier told WhatsApp to withdraw its policy.“We will continue to display our updates from time to time to people who have not accepted. In addition, we will display the update whenever a user chooses relevant optional features, like when a user communicates with a business receiving support from Facebook,” Senior Advocate Harish Salve, representing WhatsApp, told the court.The court was hearing an appeal against the Competition Commission of India’s ongoing probe into WhatsApp’s privacy policy.Salve, while explaining the company’s position, submitted before the court that “the update which triggered the enquiry of CCI is for the present… we have voluntarily agreed to put it on hold.” He further said that if Parliament does not permit such a policy in future, WhatsApp would either close shop in India or would not implement it.
“The commitment is that I will not do anything till the parliamentary law comes. Obviously then if parliamentary law comes, you have to fit within that law. If Parliament allows me to have a separate policy for India, I will have it. If it does not allow me, then bad luck. I will then have to take a call,” Salve said.WhatsApp and Facebook have approached the High Court against the CCI order dated March 24, in which the competition regulator came to a prima facie conclusion that the conduct of WhatsApp in “sharing of users’ personalised data with other Facebook companies, in a manner that is neither fully transparent nor based on voluntary and specific user consent” appears unfair to users. The CCI had ordered the DG to complete the investigation within 60 days.A single-judge bench of the High Court had on April 22 dismissed the petitions filed by WhatsApp and Facebook which have been arguing that the issue related to the privacy policy is already pending before the Supreme Court and High Court. The companies have approached the division bench in appeal against the single-bench decision and the CCI order.Salve on Friday submitted before the court that WhatsApp’s challenge against the CCI inquiry has become stronger. “Today, this entire inquiry is in the air. You are inquiring into the implications of a policy which the Government of India has told me to ‘take it off’ and I have taken it off till the time Parliament makes a law,” he said.
