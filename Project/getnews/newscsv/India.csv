"Man City are everything Man United should aspire to be, as latest derby drubbing further proves - ESPN India
Alexis Nunes and Janusz Michallik discuss Manchester United's devastating loss to Manchester City. (1:45)MANCHESTER, England -- David Moyes was once ridiculed for saying that Manchester United should aspire to be like Manchester City, but the former United manager was right when he said it in 2014 and it still rings true today, following  -- 4-1 this time -- which restored the champions' six-point lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.Two goals apiece from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez -- Jadon Sancho had earlier equalised after De Bruyne's opener -- gave City a comfortable victory that was much more emphatic than the score line suggests. At one point during the second half, City amassed 92% of possession during a 15-minute period as United's players were tormented by the 'oles' of the home supporters.United were humiliated, with former captains Gary Neville and Roy Keane lambasting the performance in their roles as TV pundits. Neville said United ""finished like an absolute shower"" and ""were a disgrace in the last 25 minutes,"" while Keane accused Ralf Rangnick's players of a ""shameful"" performance. ""They gave up,"" Keane said.Such condemnation is becoming a recurring theme whenever United play against a major rival. Already this season, they have lost 5-0 at home to Liverpool and then lost 2-0 against City at Old Trafford in a game that could have -- and maybe should have -- ended with Pep Guardiola's team winning by an even bigger margin than Liverpool.There was once a time when United ruthlessly defeated their rivals on a regular basis, back in the days when Sir Alex Ferguson's team won 13 titles in 20 years. But those days are gone and Guardiola said after this game that United's decline is a warning to City and all other clubs who think their dominance will never end.""United couldn't expect a decade ago so many years without titles,"" Guardiola said. ""But this is a lesson we must learn too. You can't believe you are so good that what happened to United can't happen.""- O'Hanlon, Ogden: Man United's next manager

""I remember AC Milan, so many Champions Leagues and titles and then they have been so many years without playing in Europe. When I was a teenager, the team of Arrigo Sacchi was the best in the world, but it doesn't matter how big you are, it can happen.""It is a statistical anomaly that United had won four of their previous seven games against City prior to this defeat, but those victories never amounted to anything tangible. City, meanwhile, just continued to win titles. In contrast, United's last trophy came in 2017.City are consistently exceptional. Their players perform to a clear plan constructed by Guardiola and his coaches, and they have a squad stocked with supremely talented players who are prepared to work harder than their opponents whenever they play.United have a squad that cost almost as much as City's, but while the Blues get value for money, the Reds just throw it away by paying over the odds, repeatedly, for mediocre players. The likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire wouldn't come close to City's squad, but their collective transfer fees amount to a staggering £165 million, so it's not as if United have done anything on the cheap in recent years.When Moyes made his remarks, it was following a 3-0 derby defeat at home to City in March 2014, when United were reigning champions, which ultimately helped the Blues beat Liverpool to the title that season. Moyes was fired within a month and United's tailspin of different managers and under-performing players continues, eight years on.Where United have chopped and changed, City have enjoyed the stability of having Guardiola in charge for the last six years. Manuel Pellegrini was manager for three years prior to that, so there is a thread of consistency at City, which now shows itself on the pitch, where the players perform as if on auto-pilot. Their passing is unerringly accurate and they know how to win.And they have players like De Bruyne, who has become as influential a midfielder in the Premier League as the likes of Keane, Patrick Vieira, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard before him.United had no answer to De Bruyne in this game, with Fred and Scott McTominay ill-equipped to stop him. Paul Pogba, who has been at United as long as Guardiola has been at City, only with vastly different results, shone at times and delivered an exquisite pass for Sancho's goal, before being substituted in the second half after running out of steam.City's players don't run out of steam, but winning teams tend to be blessed with players who are prepared to run all day.That's what United lacked at the Etihad, and not for the first time this season. They have a group of players who can't be relied upon when the going gets tough, and whoever is appointed as the club's next permanent manager in the summer faces a mammoth challenge to get United competing again.But the new boss won't have to look far for the perfect example of what a successful team looks like. Just like Moyes said, City are the team to aspire to.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Shane Warne’s room had blood stains on floor and bath towels: Thai police - The Indian Express
Thailand police have reportedly found “blood stains” on the floor of Shane Warne’s room and on bath towels while searching the villa where the legendary Australian cricketer died while holidaying.The 52-year-old cricketing legend was declared dead by doctors in the Thai International Hospital on Friday night, after friends tried to revive him in his luxury villa hours earlier.On Sunday, skynews.com.au quoted Thai media saying that the Thai police had found blood on the floor and bath towels in the room Warne was staying.“A large amount of blood was found in the room,” Satit Polpinit, a commander of the local provincial police, told Thai media.“When CPR was started, the deceased had coughed up liquid and was bleeding.”According to the Koh Samui’s Bo Phut police station superintendent Yuttana Sirisomba, Warne had “seen a doctor about his heart” recently, following which they have ruled out treating it as suspicious death.Warne along with his friends had reportedly travelled to the popular island of Koh Samui, situated in the Gulf of Thailand.As per the local police information, one of Warne’s friends found the Aussie legend unresponsive around 5pm.The group commenced CPR on Warne while waiting for an ambulance.Warne’s management later released a brief statement to confirm his death.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/01/shane-warne-1200.jpg,"Pakistan cricket captain Bismah Maroof wins hearts online as photos of her carrying baby to World Cup match goes viral - The Tribune India

On the day Wriddhiman Saha deposed before the BCCI-appointed three-member committee and said he had told them ‘everything’ about the identity of the unnamed person, who had allegedly “bullied” the wicketkeeper-batsman for an interview, talk show host Boria Majumdar, too, sent a chronological statement to the cricket board. In it, Majumdar accused the cricketer of “doctoring” the screenshots of the WhatsApp messages.Saha made his deposition before the committee comprising the cricket board’s vice-president Rajiv Shukla, treasurer Arun Dhumal and the BCCI Apex Council member Prabhtej Singh Bhatia.After testifying before the probe committee, Saha told reporters, “I have told the committee everything I know. I have shared all the details with them. I can’t tell you much right now. BCCI has asked me not to talk about the meeting outside as they will answer all your queries.” The Indian Express learnt that Saha had named Mujumdar, who hosts a show ‘backstage with Boria’.When contacted Majumdar he told this paper that he would file a defamation suit against Saha. “I’m filing a defamation case on Wriddhiman Saha. He has doctored, tampered and manipulated screenshots. Earlier today, I have sent the BCCI all the details and I have emailed everybody in the BCCI the entire sequence of events. I have also tweeted my side of the story,” Majumdar said. The BCCI constituted the committee last week “to look into the matter of Wriddhiman Saha receiving threats and intimidation from a senior journalist”.The 37-year-old wicketkeeper posted a tweet on February 19. “After all of my contributions to Indian cricket..this is what I face from a so-called “Respected” journalist! This is where the journalism has gone.”After all of my contributions to Indian cricket..this is what I face from a so called “Respected” journalist! This is where the journalism has gone. — Wriddhiman Saha (@Wriddhipops) February 19, 2022Saha then shared screenshots of messages from the journalist which read: “You did not call. Never again will I interview you. I don’t take insults kindly. And I will remember this.”A lot of former cricketers, including ex-Indian team head coach Ravi Shastri, sympathised with Saha, but the latter refused to name the journalist in public.Majumdar narrated his version of the sequence of events. “I have not even spoken to the man on the 19th (February). My call records and his call records can be checked. I had last spoken to him on the 13th when I called to congratulate him for his Rs 1.9 crore deal with the Gujarat Titans and that was when I requested him for an interview. He said once he goes home, he would talk to me at 8 pm and asked me to send him a Zoom link. After that I waited for two-and-a-half hours.”In his statement to the BCCI, the Majumdar has claimed that Saha’s manager visited his residence on February 1 and set up “two interviews as a brand building exercise”. On February 10, ahead of the IPL mega auction, Majumdar had sent some texts to the player via WhatsApp.There are always two sides to a story. @Wriddhipops has doctored, tampered screenshots of my WhatsApp chats which have damaged my reputation and credibility. I have requested the @BCCI for a fair hearing. My lawyers are serving @Wriddhipops a defamation notice. Let truth prevail. — Boria Majumdar (@BoriaMajumdar) March 5, 2022A series of texts was sent on February 13 also after Saha was roped in by Gujarat Titans on the second day of the auction. The journalist’s statement gave details of his WhatsApp texts to Saha, claiming that the latter had “confirmed an interview over Zoom”. As per the statement, the context of the texts was “the disappointment over failure of Mr. Saha to comply with his professional commitment and hence was an expression of dismay by Mr. Majumdar”. Majumdar has denied any threats or hostile action.Saha went unsold on Day One of the auction before getting his IPL contract the following day. Before that, he was left out of the Indian team for the two-Test series against Sri Lanka.

CBI on Sunday arrested  (NSE), in a 2018 case of bourse manipulation. This is the second high-profile arrest in the case, with the agency last month , NSE’s former group operating officer and Ramkrishna’s deputy and confidante.“Ramkrishna has been arrested following questioning and will be produced in a competent court on Monday,” a CBI official said. Ramkrishna had earlier been questioned by the agency last month along with Subramanain and former NSE CEO Ravi Narain.The CBI action comes in the wake of allegations against Ramkrishna that she was with a “Himalayan Yogi” and had got Subramanian appointed in violation of rules.🗞️  🗞️A SEBI order of February 11 has levied a fine of Rs 3 crore on Ramkrishna for violating rules in his appointment.According to SEBI, several key decisions taken by Ramkrishna during her tenure as NSE’s MD and CEO from 2013 to 2016, including Subramanian’s appointment, were guided by an unidentified “paramahansa who may be largely dwelling in the Himalayan Ranges”.An Ernst and Young audit report has indicated that the . Investigating agencies, however, have not yet reached any conclusion with regard to the Yogi’s real identity.The CBI’s case pertains to charges of some brokers being given preferential access to the NSE’s trading system in the form of a co-location facility through which they bought “rack space” for their servers. According to the agency, these traders obtained faster access to the Exchange’s data feed — even a split-second advantage can lead to huge gains.Last month, a CBI team visited the SEBI office in Mumbai and collected documents related to the case in which it has already booked Sanjay Gupta, the owner and promoter of Delhi-based OPG Securities Pvt Ltd, and others.According to the CBI, between 2010 and 2014, Gupta allegedly “abused” the NSE server architecture in a criminal conspiracy with “unknown officials” from the Exchange.“Gupta, with the help of his brother-in-law Aman Kokrady and other unknown persons, managed the data centre staff of NSE, who passed the information regarding switching on time of NSE exchange servers. Further, unknown officials of NSE gave OPG Securities Pvt Ltd access to servers which were technologically latest and least crowded at that particular period. This helped OPG Securities Pvt Ltd. in being mostly the first one to login on the exchange server of the NSE,” the CBI’s FIR said.The allegations of unfair access were first made in January 2015 by a whistleblower who wrote to SEBI. A SEBI technical advisory committee report found that OPG Securities had consistently logged in first on selected servers on most trading days in 2010-2014, and had access to servers with better hardware. Gupta is also alleged to have bribed SEBI officials to obtain a favourable assessment.

The Shiba Inu hype is dying slowly, and it is clear that investors are not giving it much attention. The fast-reducing number of transactions of the Shiba Inu is a sign that things are not good. The crypto coin is losing traction at a fast rate.Though Shiba is still one of the largest cryptocurrencies, currently at #14 of the top largest cryptocurrencies by marketcap, it might be overtaken by the fast-growing Bitgert project. Bitgert has already reached a $500m marketcap. Here is more about Bitgert and how it is overtaking Shiba Inu: There is every indication that Bitgert is going to be one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the industry. The launch of the BRC20 blockchain, which is a zero gas fee chain, has given Bitgert the push it needed to overtake all the cryptocurrencies previously considered its competitor. Among them is Shiba Inu, which is yet to develop its own blockchain despite being older than Bitgert.The Bitgert BRC20 blockchain is a game-changing chain because of its zero gas features and also the fastest speed. Brise chain is the fastest blockchain today at 100k TPS, which is faster than Solana’s 65k TPS. The Bitgert team also plans to have 1000+ on the ecosystem in the next 365 days. The Bitgert centralized exchange is launching in Q1 and is expected to promote mass adoption of the Bitgert chain. With all these features and products, Bitgert is going to easily overtake Shiba Inu. Apart from Bitgert, crypto investors should also take a look at the Centcex project. This is a new project that is proving a perfect crypto investment for those looking for long-term investment. The Centcex team is working on building a project with the biggest number of products. Maybe thousands of Centcex products in the coming years.The Centcex project’s objective is to have as many quality products as possible on the chain. These products will generate revenue that will be distributed to all the investors who have staked their tokens. That’s what makes Centcex one of the most exciting projects to invest in today. The Shiba Inu has been one of the biggest cryptocurrencies, but the recent developments have seen the coin slowdown in terms of growth. The number of Shiba transactions has been dropping by huge percentages in 2022. The marketcap for this cryptocurrency has also been dropping over the last few months.The slow development of the Shiba products has been cited as one of the reasons why new projects like Bitgert are outperforming the project. Bitgert BRC20 blockchain is one of the products that will make this project overtake Shiba Inu. The Shiba team must develop more products to make the cryptocurrency competitive again

It was yet another dismal week for the market. The benchmark indices shed around 2.5 percent over the worsening Russia-Ukraine war that further pushed up oil prices over supply concerns, fuelling worries of runaway inflation.Auto sales for the month of February and Q3FY22 GDP data also dampened the sentiment for the week ended March 4.Both equity benchmarks finished the week below the closing low of February 24, the biggest single-day fall this year.The Sensex plunged 1,525 points, or 2.73 percent, to 54,334, and the Nifty50 declined 413 points, or 2.48 percent, to 16,245, weighed down by auto, banking & financials and consumption stocks. Metal, oil & gas and IT indices bucked the trend and curtailed losses.The broader markets outperformed the frontliners. The Nifty Midcap 100 index fell 1.5 percent and smallcap 100 index 0.35 percent.The coming week is expected to favour bears again, given the elevated volatility unless the Ukraine situation subsides. The election results on March 10 could also influence the market, experts said.""The market's direction would be heavily influenced by the ongoing geopolitical tensions. On the macroeconomic front, investors will be keeping a careful eye on China's and the United States' inflation numbers.“As commodities and crude oil prices are skyrocketing amid the war, inflation data becomes a critical indicator to determine the Fed's next course of action,"" said Yesha Shah, Head of Equity Research at Samco Securities.Considering these events and state election results, ""the market's rangebound movement is expected to continue, and investors can look for selective buying while maintaining an overall cautious outlook,"" she said.Here are 10 key factors that will keep traders busy next week:Ukraine-Russia WarThe Russia and Ukraine war would be the biggest factor for markets. Russia is getting aggressive by stepping up military operations, facing strong resistance from Ukrainians.Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Ukrainian statehood was in jeopardy and likened the West’s sanctions on Russia to “declaring war”, while a promised ceasefire in the besieged port city of Mariupol collapsed amid scenes of terror, the Associated Press reported.Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has been asking for weapons from western countries and has sought more sanctions against Moscow. To Check All Live Updates on Ukraine-Russia WarAround 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine, triggering the worst refugee crisis of the century. Thousands of Indians, most of them students of medicine, have left the war-torn country and are being brought back home.The United States, too, has asked its citizens to leave Russia immediately over fears of harassment by Russian security officials and expected issues of accessing money after Visa and Mastercard suspended operations in Russia.Oil priceThe war has pushed oil prices to their highest level in a decade. The reports of the US considering an option to cut US imports of Russian oil also lifted sentiment. International benchmark Brent crude futures hit nearly $120 a barrel during the week, the highest intraday level since May 2012, before finishing the week at $118.11 a barrel on March 4, the highest closing level since February 2013.Also read: High oil prices raised risks of inflation and worries for corporate earnings as several sectors may face margin pressure over the increasing operations cost. Economic growth may also get hit over the short term and the trade deficit could get widened as India imports 80-85 percent of its oil requirement.Experts expect oil prices to remain elevated as long as the Ukraine war continues, which could keep equity markets volatile.Also read: States election ResultsThe results of the Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand assembly elections to be announced on March 10 could also influence the market.Experts expect a bit of volatility but that would be temporary, as the market generally focuses more on national elections rather than states.""While state-level elections do create anxiety about uncertain outcomes, they do not impact the overall earnings trajectory of the corporate sector in a material way. Therefore, the state election results may have some short-term market impact but we believe that long-term investors would ignore these election results,"" said Abhay Agarwal of Piper Serica.Global data pointsThe US and China's inflation numbers for February will be closely watched by global investors as further moves related to policy tightening by the Federal Reserve will be dependent on inflation data. In January, the US inflation hit a 40-year high of 7.5 percent, favouring expectations of more rate hikes in coming quarters.Also read: Here are other key global data points to watch out for next week:Foreign institutional investors (FII) have been on a selling spree due to the Ukraine-Russia war, higher commodity prices and expected policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve. Domestic institutional investors (DII) managed to offset FII outflow to a great extent.Experts expect the selling to remain intense and feel the market may get support from DIIs, though the upside is feeling pressure from FIIs.FIIs have net sold more than Rs 2 lakh crore worth of shares since October 2021, which seems to be the highest monthly selling streak. In the same period, DIIs net bought Rs 1.38 lakh crore worth of shares.In the week gone by, FIIs net sold shares worth Rs 22,563 crore, whereas the net buying by DIIs was to the tune of Rs 16,742 crore.Also read: Economic DataIndustrial and manufacturing production data for February will be released on March 4. Bank loan as well as deposit growth for fortnight ended February 25, along with foreign exchange reserves data for the week ended March 4, will also be released the same day.Technical ViewThe Nifty has moved closer to its crucial support of 16,130 on March 4 and if that gets decisively broken in coming sessions, the index could see more selling towards the 16,000-15,800 range, experts said.The index has formed a bearish candle, which resembles the Spinning Top pattern on the daily charts, indicating indecisiveness among the bulls and the bears. There was bearish candle formation on the weekly scale, indicating nervousness among traders and investors. So, overall the trend seems to be in favour of the bears with consolidation.""Formation of range movement at the lower high has eventually resulted in a downside breakout. The overall chart pattern signal more weakness for the Nifty ahead and the new swing lows of around 15,800 could be registered in the next one-two weeks.

Washington [US], March 6 (ANI): A recent study led by a tea of clinical researchers has found that women who got their first menstrual period (menarche) at a younger age are more likely to report chronic pain in adulthood.The findings of the study were published in the journal 'PAIN', the official publication of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).""We found strong associations between age at menarche and chronic pain outcomes in adult women,"" according to the new research by Charlotte Indre Lund, PhD fellow in Epidemiology at Oslo University Hospital, and colleagues.The findings add to previous evidence suggesting that increased estrogen levels associated with early menarche may contribute to pain, and to sex differences in pain in general.The study included data on more than 12,000 women (average age 55) participating in the Tromso Study, an ongoing population study of the health of people in northern Norway. The researchers analysed associations between women's self-reported age at menarche and the presence and characteristics of chronic pain.The women's reported average age at menarche was about 13 years. About 40 per cent of women reported experiencing chronic pain.Women with younger age at menarche were more likely to have chronic pain. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the relative risk of chronic pain decreased by 2 per cent for each one-year delay in menarche. Absolute risk decreased by 1.1 to 1.4 percentage points per year. Across the full range of reported ages - from 9 to 18 years - the absolute risk of chronic pain differed by 12.6 percentage points.Older age at menarche was associated with lower rates of chronic pain in each of 10 body regions assessed, with the strongest associations for chest and abdominal pain. Younger age at menarche was associated with a longer duration of pain.Based on recently updated criteria, the prevalence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) was 7.4 per cent. Later menarche was associated with a decreased risk of experiencing CWP, with a risk ratio of 7 per cent and an absolute risk difference of 1.5 percentage points per year.Based on the new findings, the researchers conclude that ""Age at menarche is an independent risk factor for chronic pain, site-specific chronic pain, and chronic widespread pain and (thereby) contribute to the explanation of sex differences in pain.""Each additional year of delay to the first menstrual period is associated with a reduced risk for having chronic pain lasting 5 years or longer, as well as a reduced risk of CWP.

March 8 is International Women’s Day, so it’s a good time to focus on nutrients of particular concern to women. Like men, women should follow an eating pattern that balances fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, dairy and healthy fats in the right amounts for their bodies. However, women have some additional considerations when it comes to eating well for their health, specifically with regard to their intake of the following vitamins and minerals.Calcium and vitamin DCalcium is an essential mineral required for our nerves and muscles to function properly, but it is perhaps best known for its role in helping to grow and maintain healthy bones. In order for the body to absorb calcium, vitamin D must also be present. Without adequate vitamin D, the body is forced to rely on calcium stores from the bones, which can eventually lead to osteoporosis. Because women are at a higher risk for developing osteoporosis, it is especially important for women and girls to get adequate calcium and vitamin D daily. Calcium is found in dairy products like milk, yogurt and cheese, fish with bones, and certain leafy green vegetables like kale. Likewise, vitamin D is found in fortified dairy, mushrooms, fortified breakfast cereals, egg yolks and beef liver.IronIron requirements for women can change depending on stage of life. During pregnancy, iron needs are higher, while after menopause they typically decrease. Food sources of iron include beans, beef, poultry and fish, liver and leafy green vegetables, along with fortified cereals and breads. Plant-based sources of iron should be eaten with vitamin C to help with absorption.Folic acidFolic acid (folate) is an important vitamin for women, especially during the reproductive years. A lack of folic acid during pregnancy can lead to birth defects. Women who are not pregnant should consume at least 400 micrograms per day of folate, while the recommendation is increased to 600 micrograms during pregnancy, and a supplement may be recommended by a doctor or dietitian to meet needs. Food sources of folic acid include fortified cereals and breads, leafy green vegetables and oranges.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/timesnews.net/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/40/b40e5c3c-3898-11eb-ad65-4fe68f20c36f/5fce3c84d05f2.image.jpg?resize=400%2C127
"Hrithik Roshan calls rumoured GF Saba Azad ‘an extraordinary human’ as she hums a Bangla song; Actress REACTS - PINKVILLA
Hrithik Roshan can’t stop gushing over his rumoured girlfriend Saba Azad. A few moments back, Saba took to her Instagram space and posted a video in which she can be seen humming a Bengali song from Satyajit Ray’s classic film ‘Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne’. Sharing the video, Saba mentioned that as a child, she learned every song on the album, even though she did not understand the language back then. However, she added, that a few days back, when she was keeping unwell, she revisited the song and recorded herself singing it, only to realize that she has not forgotten a word after all these years. Hrithik could not stop himself from appreciating the actress-musician, and called her ‘an extraordinary human’. Read on to know how she reacted. The caption of the video posted by Saba Azad some time back read, “Sick at home with no energy to do much else than sing - when I was a smol my parents got me the cassette tape for the soundtrack of the classic Ray film “Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne” soon after we watched it at a festival. At the time I didn’t understand Bangla at all, even so it very quickly became my favourite cassette tape and I learnt every lyric of every song (however mispronounced and incorrectly - pls forgive me) on the album - yep, without understanding a word of what it meant - that’s the thing with music though right - language doesn’t matter at all, if it moves you it moves you!!” Saba further continued, “A while back on a lazy evening chilling at home singing songs with friends I realised I still remember all of them like they never left my head - here’s a scratchy voiced (warts and all) version of the one I love the most - maybe if I find the courage I’ll sing them all to you - excuse my throat i shoulda warmed up before recording”. Watching Saba’s video, Hrithik commented, “You are an extraordinary human”. To this, the Rocket Boys actress replied. “@hrithikroshan and you’re the kindest (smiling emoji)”For the unversed, rumour mills have it that Hrithik Roshan and Saba Azad are dating. However, the duo is yet to comment on this. They have been in the headlines ever since they were spotted walking hand-in-hand outside a restaurant in Mumbai. Recently, Hrithik’s family sent Saba a delicious meal as she has been unwell. She took to her Instagram stories to share a picture of the same as she thanked them for the kind deed. ALSO READ: ",https://www.pinkvilla.com/imageresize/hrithik_and_saba_video_main_0_0.jpg?width=752&format=webp&t=pvorg,"Happy Faces: Ranbir Kapoor enjoys family time with mom Neetu and sister Riddhima Kapoor Sahni; PIC - PINKVILLA

ARIES (Mar 21 – Apr. 20)
The future looks relatively optimistic at the moment. In fact that’s an amazing understatement! The stars are emphasising peace rather than war, so they may bring sweetness and light to areas of your life from which they have been sadly lacking. Make sure that other people feel good as well, and your thoughtfulness will give you credit.TAURUS (Apr. 21 – May 21)
The week begins and ends with significant domestic indications. How about formulating plans today and then waiting about four or five days before putting them into practice? One thing is certain: conditions can only get better. But it may take an almighty effort to see that improvements last.GEMINI (May 22 – June 21)
Your skills as a peacemaker could be in demand at home over the coming days. One thing to remember is that disputes will arise as a result of the sheer range of different options, not from any ill-will. And that’s the simple reason why you should give partners the benefit of the doubt.CANCER (June 22 – July 23)
You’ve probably had enough big surprises, but fate may still have one or two tricks up its sleeve. The only complicating factor is that misunderstandings may periodically create an atmosphere of farce. A partner probably needs all the support you can give them.LEO (July 24 – Aug. 23)
You’re still unhappy about financial matters, and quite right too. If you weren’t dissatisfied with the conditions of your life you’d never make the necessary improvements. Everything will work out if you realise that you have another two weeks before agreements will stick.VIRGO (Aug. 24 – Sept. 23)
Your stars are splendid, as they often are at this time of year. Play social activities to the hilt but take it easy if firm agreement is required. You might find that close partners are impossible to pin down, but then what is new? Perhaps your demands are impossible to meet!LIBRA (Sept. 24 – Oct. 23)
You are generally quite keen to dominate your environment, though in the nicest possible way. Yet, at the moment, I doubt if you are genuinely able to exert any sort of real or permanent control. You see, there are just too many powerful emotions and volatile undercurrents.SCORPIO (Oct. 24 – Nov. 22)
Your social planets really are exceptional, as you often find in the current season. Just don’t get all huffy if promises are broken and arrangements forgotten – it’s all in the stars! Or is it? By that I mean that the best place to start might be a long look at your own behaviour.SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 – Dec. 22)
The Moon is moving from one lively position to another! I’d say that you’d do well to keep your wits about you and pursue your affairs as conscientiously as possible. Your interests are served best at home if you keep talking. Pick the right words, choose the most appropriate moment and you should win partners over!CAPRICORN (Dec. 23 – Jan. 20)
Try and get everything important done as soon as you can, before fresh information arrives and circumstances move on. That way you’ll be able to enjoy pleasurable propositions when they arrive, and get ready for more significant developments – just in case!AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 – Feb. 19)
You may now have to do some quick thinking if you are to avoid personal complications. However, if at all possible, do bring in other people who can share any good fortune and stand with you in adversity. Also, do yourself a favour and keep a watchful eye on your cash.PISCES (Feb. 20 – Mar 20)
You have a great deal to achieve. Don’t allow arguments or conflicts to make you drop out of the race. You’re not normally so competitive, but neither can you really afford to let partners treat you as a complete push-over. Frankly, the more support you’ve got from friends, the better.

Actress Bhavana has said that she was devastated and wanted to get her dignity back after she was sexually assualted five years ago.In a live interview to a private YouTube channel, ‘The Mojo Story’, the noted actress spoke up, ending her five-year silence, and declared that she would give a strong fight without thinking about the outcome.The actress, who had essayed prominent roles in Malayalam, Tamil, Kannada and Telugu movies, said her family, including her husband, close relatives, friends and the general public had supported her during her traumatic period.Bhavna said: “My dignity has been shredded to a million pieces.” It was sheer willpower that kept her going, she added. The actress said she felt lonely despite the strong support extended to her by her family and friends.She recalled how she was in the courtroom for 15 days in 2020 from morning till evening. Each time a lawyer cross-examined her — and she was quizzed by a battery of seven lawyers — she had to prove that she was innocent.Bhavana said the perpetrators were insulting her on social media after the traumatic incident and added that after the incident she was denied acting jobs in the Malayalam film industry. The notable exceptions were directors such as Ashik Abu and Shaji Kailas, actor-turned-director Prithviraj, and actor Jayasurya.The actress was kidnapped in 2017 when she was returning home from a shooting location and was subjected to sexual assault by a gang of men.The incident snowballed into a major controversy after the main accused, Pulsar Sunil, revealed that popular Malayalam actor Dileep was behind the assault.

"Orbiting Robots Could Help Fix and Fuel Satellites in Space – The Wire Science - The Wire Science
Within a few years, NASA’s OSAM-1 mission will launch into space and use a robotic arm to refuel the Landsat 7 Earth-observation satellite. Image: NASAFor more than 20 years, the Landsat 7 satellite circled Earth every 99 minutes or so, capturing images of almost all the planet’s surface each 16 days. One of many craft that observed the changing globe, it revealed melting glaciers in Greenland, the growth of shrimp farms in Mexico and the extent of deforestation in Papua New Guinea. But after Landsat 7 ran short on fuel, its useful life effectively ended. In space, regular servicing has not been an option.Now, though, NASA has a potential fix for such enfeebled satellites. In a few years, the agency plans to launch a robot into orbit and maneuver it to within grabbing distance of Landsat 7. The robot will use a mechanical arm to catch hold of it and refuel it, mid-air.If successful, the mission would mark a milestone – the first time a satellite would be refueled in space. And this mission is just one of a number of planned public and private ventures intended to use robots to repair and improve the billions of dollars’ worth of satellites in orbit.Eventually, efforts like these could lead to better and cheaper satellites that lower the cost of Internet and cell phone networks, provide better weather forecasts and give unprecedented views of planetary change and of the universe. They could even enable a new wave of in-orbit construction, with armies of robots building satellites, space stations and even Mars-bound spaceships.Giving satellites longer livesAt the moment there are about 4,852 working satellites in orbit, playing crucial roles in communications, remote sensing and other tasks. Almost all were launched with the knowledge that if anything broke there was no way of fixing it. Most satellites also need fuel to occasionally adjust their orbits. Once that’s gone they may become so much space junk, adding to the already substantial stream of debris encircling the globe.“Imagine you’re going to go buy a car tomorrow,” says Brian Weeden, head of an industry group called the Consortium for Execution of Rendezvous and Servicing Operations (CONFERS). “And you have to keep in mind that you’re never going to be able to put more gas in it. You can never change the oil. You can never maintain or fix anything. And you have to use it for the next 10 years. Now, how expensive and how complicated do you think that car is going to be? That’s exactly what we have been doing with satellites.”To keep satellites working as long as possible, engineers build in redundant systems and pack in as much fuel as they can fit. All this over-engineering adds to the costs of building and launching the satellites – a modern communications satellite can cost about $500 million.Almost all construction and repair that has happened in space so far has relied at least in part on astronauts, including fixes on the Hubble Space Telescope, and construction of the International Space Station. But sending humans into space is tremendously expensive, so the effort to develop robots to do the job has grown in recent years.“What we would really like to do is have some way of having a robotic mechanic in space that can fix satellites when they break,” says Carl Glen Henshaw, head of the robotics and machine learning section at the US Naval Research Laboratory.Robots to the rescueIn the last few decades, researchers have made progress toward that goal. In a 2007 NASA demonstration project, a pair of specially built craft docked in orbit and transferred fuel. More recently, in 2020, the aerospace company Northrop Grumman successfully launched two “,” equipped with their own engines and fuel, that attached themselves to two commercial satellites and boosted them into new orbits.Two new missions expected to launch this decade will take servicing a step further. The demonstration projects will use semiautonomous robots equipped with mechanical arms to add fuel to orbiting satellites, and even to make simple repairs.For his part, Henshaw is working on Robotic Servicing of Geosynchronous Satellites, a US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)-funded mission. If it succeeds in a demonstration scheduled for 2024, it would mark the first time a robotic craft has managed to grab a satellite that was not specifically designed to dock with it. Henshaw and his colleagues recently explored some of the challenges faced in servicing satellites with space robots in the Annual Review of Control, Robotics and Autonomous Systems.There are a lot of such challenges. Because existing satellites were never intended to be serviced, they lack the markings, called fiducials, that would make it easier for a robot to visually orient itself with the moving satellite. There are no fixtures designed for the robot to hold on to. And the parts of a satellite that do stick out, like antennas and solar panels, tend to be too fragile to grab.Another problem is the time lag between the robot and Earth. For a robot operating in geosynchronous orbit, about 35,000 kilometers up, distance and signal processing create a communication delay of several seconds between the robot and its controllers on Earth. So the robot will need to handle the most crucial tasks on its own.On the plus side, the work can build on existing robotic arms in space, including two currently in use on the International Space Station.For a demonstration mission, Henshaw and his fellow engineers plan to choose one of the thousands of old, inactive satellites “parked” in out-of-the-way orbits. A robot would match orbits with the satellite, and maneuver to within about two meters, using cameras and a laser range finder. When it’s close enough, the robot would use one of its two arms to grab hold of an aluminum ring that previously anchored the satellite to the launch vehicle.The other robotic arm would be able to poke and prod solar cells or antennas that have failed to unfurl correctly – a problem that happens every two or three years, Henshaw says. And it would be able to attach new instruments to the outside of satellites, such as more powerful transmitters, cameras or antennas.Sometime after 2025, NASA plans to launch an even more ambitious robot. The On-orbit Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing 1 (OSAM-1) robot would first manage a complex refueling operation of an existing satellite. Then it would demonstrate that it can build completely new structures in space.Landsat 7 will be first on OSAM-1’s to-do list. Launched in 1999 by the US Geological Survey into low-Earth orbit, about 700 kilometers high, the satellite’s work has been taken over by more advanced satellites. But it offers scientists an opportunity to test robotic refueling.“Twenty-some years ago, technicians fueled up the satellite in preparation for launching it, and they never thought that anybody would ever touch that interface again,” says Brent Robertson, NASA’s OSAM-1 Project Manager.OSAM-1 will use its robotic arm to cut through a layer of insulation, snip two wires and unscrew a bolt before hooking up a hose and pumping in 115 kilograms of hydrazine fuel, says Robertson. (See video here.)Although repair and servicing of existing satellites is the most immediate goal, in-orbit assembly and manufacturing are potentially more important in the long run.OSAM-1, for instance, has an additional mission that will carry a separate robot called the Space Infrastructure Dexterous Robot (SPIDER), designed to demonstrate that it can assemble things in space. SPIDER’s first task will be to put together a seven-piece, three-meter antenna that it carried up into orbit.Using a process similar to 3D printing, OSAM-1 will also aim to show that it can build structural components from scratch, creating strong yet lightweight composite beams out of spools of carbon fiber and other textiles. Beams like these could be connected to form structural components of a satellite or other orbiting structures.If the missions now in planning succeed, robotics could open a new era of space construction that is unaffordable today – fuel depots, space mining operations, roomier space stations for space tourism and even Mars-bound spaceships constructed in orbit.“We want to demonstrate that we can build these things. No one’s done this before,” Robertson says. “If you have the capability to assemble things in space, you can bring your own material, or have material sent to you. And you can build much bigger things.”Kurt Kleiner is a freelance science journalist based in Toronto.This article originally appeared in Knowable Magazine, an independent journalistic endeavor from Annual Reviews.Vasudevan Mukunth, editor: mukunth@thewire.inGeneral enquiries: science@thewire.in",https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/05191349/1_media_space-robots-1600x600-1.jpg
"The latest Sims 4 expansion reduced me to tears - Techradar
There’s something to be said for the power of nostalgia. Many of us over a certain age have grown up with an appreciation for early video games that’s likely lost on the younger generation, and I feel that The Sims franchise is especially notable for this if you don’t identify as straight. The latest expansion pack 'Wedding Stories' offers a host of marriage ceremony-specific features, alongside placing a same-sex couple at the front of most of its advertising, and as a queer woman that's grown up playing the franchise from its first base game, I was ecstatic. If your eyes started rolling at that, this piece probably isn’t for you – the Sims franchise is, of course, beloved outside of the LGBTQIA+ community, but it holds a special place for queer and curious kids who were able to explore their sexuality, and I’m not going to shy away from that. This isn’t to say that heterosexual people can’t also resonate with how the various editions of The Sims has grown with us as a society though, as I'm sure we can all share a collective outrage over base game features that were present in the original Sims released back in early 2000, slowly becoming paid-for content in DLC packs as the series has evolved (Hot tubs EA? Really?).It’s not all bad though – The Sims franchise has consistently provided great representation for the gay and bisexual community that was generally lacking elsewhere. While you couldn’t get ‘gay married’ in the original version of The Sims, the simulation game never prevented you from having same-sex couples or allowing them to move in with their partners. There were very few games that allowed that kind of interaction at the time, mostly being a handful of RPG titles where the sexual identities of NPCs are swept under the rug – for example, the male protagonist in Fable is able to romance and marry an NPC regardless of their gender, but while a union between him and a female character is treated legitimately, marrying a man is comedic and seen as ‘just a couple of blokes being blokes’. Remember kids, it’s not gay if it's just you and The Boys™ joking around.There’s also plenty of queer characters within The Sims lore (yes, this franchise has established lore to follow), such as Dela Ostrow and Mia Hayes, two women in a relationship who feature on an updated version of The Sims 4 box, and many of the expansions have at least one same-sex couple pre-made for you to play with.Still, Wedding stories is the first DLC pack for the Sims that places queer relationships in the spotlight, with a marriage between two women being the focus of most of the marketing material. This wasn’t representation shoved to one side, instead proudly displaying it right in our faces. The content for the pack itself has very little difference regardless of if heterosexual or same-sex couples are the ones planning and throwing a wedding, but seeing sexual diversity so openly represented by a mainstream game franchise really hit me.I was a few glasses of wine down, having a chill evening and playing around with the expansion and a few tears were shed. I didn’t feel like EA was queerbaiting its player base at all with the advertising angle it took which was refreshing enough, but it made me smile to think that this is how far the simulation franchise had come. Jump back many years to when I would try and hide my queer characters from my parents on the family computer, it’s so nice to feel like folks like me are actively considered when developing a game rather than as an afterthought.That said, I headed into playing the most recent Sims 4 expansion Wedding Stories with a handful of concerns. There was already controversy that the game wouldn’t be sold in Russia due to the country's restrictive laws on queer content, which was met with some hefty backlash from long-time fans of the series. That decision was eventually rolled back after EA announced that all versions of the game would be released on February 23, albeit with updated cover artwork that will remove the images of women getting married from the cover art in Russia.The expansion itself has also had some heat, and honestly, that’s understandable. The game is pretty buggy, not to the point where i’d say it’s unplayable but it certainly made the experience a lot more frustrating than it should have been. Wedding guests ignored dress codes you set and refused to stay seated, and brides kept changing out of their wedding outfits to name just a few issues I experienced.It was announced on March 3 that a patch was in the works that should fix most of the issues blighting players, but to have put the game on sale in this state in the first place is certainly questionable.Sul Sul Simmers! 👋 We've got a Laundry List full of love and fixes. ❤️🛠 Check out the latest list for My Wedding Stories that we aim to resolve in an upcoming patch! 🧺📝 : https://t.co/PKZoqhsbUN pic.twitter.com/0Sb3r649LCMarch 3, 2022Here are a few of the changes being introduced, courtesy of the official Sims 4 Laundry List:Sadly, with the actual game being so buggy, it’s hard to recommend it in its current state, so if you have your heart set on picking it up, I'd recommend you give it a month or two for all the issues to be ironed out.You can see where The Sims has really, really tried to meet the representation standards expected of its fans, with some non-western outfits and wedding traditions included alongside the typical white dresses and exchanging of vows, but given I’m whiter than mayonnaise, I can’t really speak with any authority if they’re accurate or well-received. I am happy about its allyship though, and that feels more important than ever with the backlash that queer folk face when they’re granted representation in popular media. Sure, I had to be drunk to actually enjoy the gameplay, but I’m so incredibly happy with how far we’ve come to walk a same-sex couple down the aisle without needing to fish around online for mods.Jess is TechRadar's Computing writer, where she covers all aspects of Mac and PC hardware, including PC gaming and peripherals.

WHILE PRIME Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Pune city on Sunday to inaugurate the 12-km stretch of the Pune Metro, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray decided to stay away from the mega event. Sena’s mouthpiece, Saamna, has also completely blacked out the event as it made no mention of the PM slated to inaugurate the Metro rail service.🗞️  🗞️While the Shiv Sena cited no reason for his skipping the event, party leaders said the CM wants to send out a strong message to the PM that “whatever his government is doing against Sena and MVA leaders, he has not liked it.”PM Modi inaugurated the Pune Metro stretches on two corridors at 11.30 am on Sunday. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and Urban Development Department Minister Eknath Shinde, who is a Sena leader, attended the inauguration ceremony.When asked about the CM staying away from the event, Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, “The CM skipped the event, but sent our minister Eknath Shinde. In the absence of the CM, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar represented the government.”When asked whether the CM had travel restrictions post his surgery last year, Raut said, “I don’t know whether this was the reason. I am not the government spokesperson. This is something which the government should clarify.”Sena leaders claimed the CM did not want to share the dais with PM Modi since his government is targeting the party leaders through investigating agencies. “When Sena leaders are being harassed brazenly by the Modi government through agencies like ED, the CM sharing the dais with the PM is like giving sanctity to the Centre’s actions. The CM wants to express his anger at whatever the Modi government is doing,” a senior Sena leader close to Thackeray said.Another Sena leader said, “The Modi government’s relations with all non-BJP governments are deteriorating by the day. For this, no one else can be blamed than the Prime Minister himself. He is leading a government that is targeting opposition leaders through the central agencies. The CM has done the right thing by skipping the event.”While the Sena mouthpiece, Saamana, carried a full front-page  released by the BJP about the inauguration of the event, the newspaper, however, did not carry a word about it in its news column.However, last week, Ajit Pawar said that the Chief Minister had been invited to the event. “But it will all depend on whether he is in a position to travel post his surgery.”

Karnataka Police have invoked sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act,1967 against 10 people arrested in connection with the February 20 murder of a Bajrang Dal worker in the Shivamogga region of the state.🗞️  🗞️Pressing charges under the UAPA against the accused in the murder of Harsha Hindu, 27, who had a criminal background, is being seen as a precursor to handing over the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA).“There is suspicion of a larger conspiracy behind the murder,” a senior state police official said. Provisions of the UAPA are generally invoked in cases where there is suspicion of a conspiracy to target national integrity. The UAPA gives the police custody of a suspect for 30 days, and 180 days to file charge sheet instead of 90 days in ordinary cases. The law also makes it difficult to get a bail.Harsha was hacked to death by a group of men with whom he allegedly had a feud since 2016.One of the 10 people arrested for the crime, Mohammed Kashif, 30, was in prison with Harsha in 2017. Several other accused who allegedly assisted him have multiple cases of assault, burglary and robbery against them.Sources said the murder could be an outcome of a clash between Harsha and one of his attackers on the premises of a court around six months ago. However, police are looking into a larger conspiracy, especially considering that the crime took place in the midst of the hijab ban controversy. Harsha was allegedly involved in organising support for the ban on hijab at some colleges in Shivamogga.“The accused are local criminals and there are serious doubts that they could have planned and executed the murder on their own,” a senior police officer said.Shivamogga MLA and minister KS Eshwarappa and the Union minister Shobha Karandlaje had demanded an NIA probe. On Friday, Karnataka Home Minister Araga Jnanendra, however, said the state police will continue with the probe. The state police had invoked provisions of the UAPA in a few murder cases of right-wing activists in the past.In 2016, when the Congress was in power, UAPA was invoked in the murder case of RSS worker R Rudresh days after the arrest of Bengaluru district president of the Popular Front of India (PFI).In 2015, the Mysuru police pressed charges under the UAPA against one Abid Pasha, who had links with the PFI, after finding his alleged involvement in six murders. In 2020, the the UAPA was invoked in two of 67 cases registered in connection with rioting in Bengaluru over a social media post that hurt the sentiments of Muslims. The said cases where UAPA was invoked were later handed over to the NIA.Harsha was murdered on the night of February 20 in the Doddapet police station limits of Shivamogga when he was out for dinner with a couple of his friends. The accused allegedly were waiting for him and hacked him to death. “It was a well-planned murder. All escape routes were blocked,” police sources said.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/03/HARSHA-HINDU-1.jpg
