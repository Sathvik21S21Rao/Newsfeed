Global wealth tripled over the last two decades, with China leading the way and overtaking the U.S. for the top spot worldwide.That’s one of the takeaways from a new report by the research arm of consultants McKinsey & Co. that examines the national balance sheets of ten countries representing more than 60% of world income.“We are now wealthier than we have ever been,” Jan Mischke, a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute in Zurich, said in an interview.Richest 10%The U.S., held back by more muted increases in property prices, saw its net worth more than double over the period, to $90 trillion.In both countries — the world’s biggest economies — more than two-thirds of the wealth is held by the richest 10% of households, and their share has been increasing, the report said.As computed by McKinsey, 68% of global net worth is stored in real estate. The balance is held in such things as infrastructure, machinery and equipment and, to a much lesser extent, so-called intangibles like intellectual property and patents.Financial assets are not counted in the global wealth calculations because they are effectively offset by liabilities: A corporate bond held by an individual investor, for instance, represents an I.O.U. by that company.‘Side Effects’The steep rise in net worth over the past two decades has outstripped the increase in global gross domestic product and has been fueled by ballooning property prices pumped up by declining interest rates, according to McKinsey. It found that asset prices are almost 50% above their long-run average relative to income. That raises questions about the sustainability of the wealth boom.“Net worth via price increases above and beyond inflation is questionable in so many ways,” Mischke said. “It comes with all kinds of side effects.”Surging real-estate values can make home ownership unaffordable for many people and increase the risk of a financial crisis — like the one that hit the U.S. in 2008 after a housing bubble burst. China could potentially run into similar trouble over the debt of property developers like China Evergrande Group.The ideal resolution would be for the world’s wealth to find its way into more productive investments that expand global GDP, according to the report. The nightmare scenario would be a collapse in asset prices that could erase as much as one-third of global wealth, bringing it more in line with world income.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/10/fbad170d95c44b4cae43bd624ea5e496-fbad170d95c44b4cae43bd624ea5e496-faaf7fe9be8d4b55a9e4939f7abf6637.jpg,"Kia Carens (KY) To Make Its World Premiere On December 16 - GaadiWaadi.com
Kia’s India division stated during the presentation of the 2021 MY Seltos and Sonet that a brand new vehicle is in the works for early 2022. Over the last few months, the South Korean auto major has been spotted testing a three-row UV and now more official details have come up on the internet. It has now been confirmed to make its world premiere on December 16, 2021.Internally codenamed Kia KY, it could carry the production name Carens as it was trademarked recently. Sticking by the timeline, the Kia KY will enter showrooms in the early parts of 2022. Sister brand, Hyundai, already sells the three-row Alcazar based on the Creta and Kia’s UV will be based on the highly popular Seltos midsize SUV.On the outside, the Kia KY will have strong influence from the Seltos and the Sonet while taking inspiration from the latest crop of Kia models sold in the international markets. The test mules do indicate the presence of tall pillars, a large greenhouse that should ensure a spacious cabin, possibly longer wheelbase compared to the Seltos, and a high volume enabling boot.The rear of the Kia KY will have an upright trunk lid. The interior could offer high-end features like a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, fully-digital instrumentation, wireless charger, sunroof, cruise control, BlueLink connectivity features, USB charging ports, cooled glovebox and so on.Kia could borrow the 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol and the 1.5-litre four-pot diesel from the Seltos. In the midsize SUV, the former produces 115 PS maximum power and 144 Nm of peak torque while the latter generates 115 PS and 250 Nm. Both manual and automatic transmissions will be on offer. Whether the 1.4-litre turbo petrol will be available or not is yet unknown.The upcoming three-row UV is expected to compete against Hyundai Alcazar, the upcoming Maruti Suzuki XL6 facelift and perhaps Mahindra Marazzo too. It must be noted that Hyundai is working on a similar-sized vehicle for Indonesia and it could be considered for India in the near future as well.",https://gaadiwaadi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kia-MPV-India-Teaser-1068x601.jpg,"Coforge files for US IPO via ADR route; Barings PE Asia to sell part stake - Moneycontrol

"Delhi Reports 5,277 Dengue Cases – Highest Since 2015 Outbreak - The Wire Science
Representative image of fumigation underway in Delhi. Photo: PTI.New Delhi: Dengue cases in Delhi stood at 5,277 as of November 13 – the highest recorded in the national capital since 2015, according to a weekly report by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. Nine people have died of the disease this year.Of the total, 2,569 cases were reported in the last week (ending on Saturday), which is more than double the total number of cases recorded in October (1,196) and greater than the year-end totals of 2020 (1,072) and 2019 (2,036).The high number of cases in Delhi so far this year is worrying.The spike in numbers in November, however, may not only represent new cases. The Hindustan Times quoted a senior official of the city’s health department saying around 30% of those who tested positive for dengue this month had actually tested positive earlier, and that the reporting rate has increased after the Delhi government made vector-borne diseases notifiable.When a disease is made notifiable, people who get the corresponding infections or their healthcare workers are require by law to report to government authorities. In theory, this allows authorities to monitor the progress of the disease closely and helps them develop proactive policies to help curtail a potential outbreak.Through a notification dated October 14, and effectuated from October 31, the Delhi government made all vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya, notifiable under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897.However, a doctor from a tertiary care hospital quoted in the same newspaper report said that the number of cases verified through an actual test could be as much as four-times the current figure, alleging widespread under-reporting.As The Wire Science reported earlier, “According to one estimate, the number of dengue cases the Union health ministry reported in 2006-2012 differed from hospital records by a factor of 282.”In light of the rapidly increasing number, the Delhi high court, while hearing a plea seeking steps to control the outbreak on November 9, had sought the Delhi government’s and the North Delhi Municipal corporation’s responses. The court provided them a week’s time to get back, with the next hearing set for November 18.Outside the national capital, Tripura reported 255 cases of dengue until November 10, more than 10-times last year’s total of 24. State surveillance officer Deep Kumar Debbarma reported said that the increase in cases this year was the result of better screening and migration of individuals into Tripura from other parts of the country.Coimbatore, in Tamil Nadu, is also enforcing precautionary measures in light of the infection spreading. Twenty-eight have been reported in November, according to Times of India. City health officer Satish Kumar said the frequent rains this year are the cause of the problem. He added that, apart from tests being stepped up, medical camps are also being set up around the city, where doctors are distributing tablets and ORS sachets.In mid-September this year, there was a dengue outbreak in western Uttar Pradesh, centered on Firozabad – against the backdrop of a wider viral fever outbreak.Dengue is caused by four related viruses, each called a serotype. Infections of the second serotype, called DEN-2, can cause patients to develop a haemorrhagic fever that could rapidly lead to death. This is why it is important to catch dengue infections early.With inputs from PTIVasudevan Mukunth, editor: mukunth@thewire.inGeneral enquiries: science@thewire.in",https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/16130519/dengue-pti-1630459016.jpg,"What kind of complications are seen in diabetics, and how to avoid them? - The Indian Express
A chronic health disease, diabetes is characterised by increased blood sugar along with other metabolic disorders. Dr Rajeev Gupta, internal medicine, CK Birla Hospital, Delhi explains that when the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin, or insulin action on cells becomes ineffective, hyperglycemia with its complications are seen in a patient.“These complications include infection in blood vessels and nerves. Symptoms of hyperglycemia are increased urination, weakness, weight loss, increased appetite, recurrent infections and other complications of diabetes like heart attacks, strokes or kidney failure,” he says.According to the doctor, diabetes mellitus is divided into 3 types:Type 1: Wherein the primary defect is the failure of the pancreas to produce insulin, so regular mellitus treatment is mandatory to sustain life and prevent complications. It generally affects children and young adults, but can occur at any age. Damage to cells or pancreas can be genetic or acquired by viral levels or autoimmune reactions of the body.“Type 1 diabetes demands the adoption of strict lifestyle changes and dietary habits to keep this condition under control. Unlike other conditions, an individual’s participation and medical and social support are of paramount importance,” Dr Gupta adds.Patients with type 1 diabetes need to:– Monitor and control blood sugar, cholesterol and BP consistently.
– Manage blood sugar with insulin shots as advised by a doctor.
– Rest and relaxation to reduce stress.
– Stay active with exercises.
– Make healthy food choices.
– Manage stress to postpone or avoid diabetic complications. Consult your doctor to understand how to recognise and manage complications like kidney disease, eye disease, and cardiovascular complications.
– Go for regular urine tests for albumin (ACR), fundus examination for retinopathy, and lipids assessment along with strict blood pressure control.Dr Gupta says type 2 diabetes is a more common type, characterised by primarily ineffective insulin action (insulin resistance) with a variable defect in insulin secretion. “Generally, these patients are adults who are obese or have a sedentary lifestyle. Dealing with the complications of diabetes requires effective management to reduce morbidity and mortality.“Patients must pay attention to blood sugar control, blood pressure, cholesterol, avoid smoking, reduce alcohol consumption, keep their weight under control and exercise regularly to reduce the risk of heart disease,” he explains.People with type 2 diabetes must recognise signs of impending stroke — like numbness or weakness of any limb, slurred speech, headaches, or dizziness. For early detection of kidney disease, a regular urine albumin test and kidney function test are needed.Gestational diabetesThis is the third type, majorly diagnosed in pregnant women who are not diabetic before pregnancy. Generally, a glucose tolerance test at the 27th week of gestation is routinely done to detect this condition.“Once diagnosed, the pregnancy needs to be closely monitored as there is increased risk to the fetus as well. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes should exercise regularly, ensure proper diet and insulin dosage as recommended by the doctor. After delivery, gestational diabetes normally resolves. Obese mothers need to be followed-up for any future development of diabetes,” the doctor concludes.📣 For more lifestyle news, follow us on Instagram | Twitter | Facebook and don’t miss out on the latest updates!",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/11/GettyImages-diabetes-1200.jpg,"Study finds COVID patients on antidepressants are less likely to die - Devdiscourse
A new study of health records from 87 health care centres across the United States found that people taking a class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were less likely to die of COVID-19. The findings of the study were published in the journal 'JAMA Network Open'.The results add to a body of evidence indicating that SSRIs may have beneficial effects against the worst symptoms of COVID-19, although large randomised clinical trials are needed to prove this. ""We can't tell if the drugs are causing these effects, but the statistical analysis is showing significant association. There's power in the numbers,"" said Marina Sirota, PhD, associate professor of paediatrics and a member of the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute (BCHSI) at UC San Francisco.The UCSF-Stanford research team analysed electronic health records from the Cerner Real World COVID-19 de-identified database, which had information from almost 500,000 patients across the US. This included 83,584 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January and September 2020. Of those, 3,401 patients were prescribed SSRIs. The large size of the dataset enabled researchers to compare the outcomes of patients with COVID-19 on SSRIs to a matched set of patients with COVID-19 who were not taking them, thus teasing out the effects of age, sex, race, ethnicity, and comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19, such as diabetes and heart disease, as well as the other medications the patients were taking.The results showed that patients taking fluoxetine were 28 per cent less likely to die; those taking either fluoxetine or another SSRI called fluvoxamine were 26 per cent less likely to die; the entire group of patients taking any kind of SSRI was 8 per cent less likely to die than the matched patient controls. Though the effects are smaller than those found in recent clinical trials of new antivirals developed by Pfizer and Merck, the researchers said more treatment options are still needed to help bring the pandemic to an end.""The results are encouraging. It's important to find as many options as possible for treating any condition. A particular drug or treatment may not work or be well tolerated by everyone. Data from electronic medical records allow us to quickly look into existing drugs that could be repurposed for treating COVID-19 or other conditions,"" said Tomiko Oskotsky, MD, a research scientist in Sirota's lab at BCHSI. Other authors include David K. Stevenson, MD, Ivana Maric, PhD, Ronald J Wong, PhD, and Nima Aghaeepour, PhD, of Stanford University; and Alice Tang and Boris Oskotsky, PhD, of UCSF.

Coming out strongly in support of its member, actor and producer Suriya, the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce on Monday, November 15, asked PMK leader and former Union minister Anbumani Ramadoss to refrain from criticising the actor over his film Jai Bhim. In a letter to Ramadoss, South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce President Katragadda Prasad pointed out that Suriya had acceded to his request for removal of a symbol from the Tamil film that was recently released on OTT platform, Amazon Prime Video.
""Respecting your feelings, our member Suriya immediately removed that symbol from the film,"" Prasad said. ""The South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce is pained by the fact that your party cadres continue to criticise Suriya despite neither the hero of the film nor the production house having anything to do with the decision to use that symbol in the film,"" the President of the Chamber said.The South Indian Film Chamber pointed out that Suriya, who did not have any political, caste or religious affiliations, was a socially responsible philanthropist and an advocate for equality in education. Prasad urged Ramadoss not to criticise the actor in view of this.The PMK had taken offence to the portrayal of the Vanniyar community in Jai Bhim, which they alleged was “insulting”. On Sunday, November 14, a group of PMK workers forced a theatre in Mayiladuthurai district in Tamil Nadu to stop the screening a Suriya film, Vel. The group, led by PMK's Mayiladuthurai district secretary Panneerselvam, also submitted a petition to Mayiladuthurai Superintendent of Police, demanding action against Suriya.
Read:A day later, the Vanniyar Sangam sent a legal notice to makers of actor Jai Bhim movie, alleging that the film tarnished the reputation of the Vanniyar community and sought an unconditional apology from them. Removal of references to a symbol of the Vanniyar community, an apology for ""damning, tarnishing and damaging the reputation"" of the community, desisting from similar ""malicious"" moves and payment of Rs 5 crore in damages were the demands made in the legal notice.Read:The film, though based on a true incident of custodial torture and death of a tribal man in 1995 in Tamil Nadu, contains elements of fiction. The crux of the allegations in the Vanniyar Sangam’s notice is that the Vanniyar community was shown in “poor light, vilified by naming the wicked police sub inspector as 'Guru' (Gurumurthy) and by showcasing the fire pot symbol of the community and these were both criminal and civil defamation”. The notice said that while the real life names of several people were retained in the film, the police Sub-Inspector was named Guru, while the original name of the SI was Anthonysamy.Read: Also read: ",https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/photo/81478822.cms,"Annaatthe box office collection Day 12: Rajinikanth-starrer earns Rs 225 crore - India Today

"Space Debris Threatened Crew Of ISS - Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty
The United States has condemned Russia for conducting a “dangerous and irresponsible” missile test that blew up a defunct Russian satellite, creating a debris cloud that endangered the International Space Station (ISS) and will pose a threat to space activities for years.The anti-satellite missile test on November 15 generated more than 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris, U.S. officials said. According to NASA, the test blew up one of Russia's own satellites, creating debris that forced the crew aboard the space station -- four Americans, a German, and two Russians -- to shelter into their docked spaceship capsules for two hours as a precaution to allow for a quick evacuation had it been necessary.Officials in Russia have not said anything about the U.S. assertions that it was a Russian anti-satellite test that resulted in the ISS crew having to take shelter. Russian space agency Roskosmos said on November 16 that its ""main priority has been, and remains, to ensure the unconditional safety of the crew"" of the space laboratory orbiting at an altitude of about 420 kilometers.The agency was continuing to ""monitor the situation in order to prevent and counter all possible threats to the safety” of the ISS and its crew, it said in a statement.In a statement on November 15, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned: “The long-lived debris created by this dangerous and irresponsible test will now threaten satellites and other space objects that are vital to all nations’ security, economic, and scientific interests for decades to come.""“In addition, it will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station and other human spaceflight activities,” he added. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said he was “outraged” at the alleged Russian anti-satellite test.""With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts,"" Nelson said in a statement.“Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station and the taikonauts on board,” he added.U.S. Space Command said its initial assessment was that the debris will remain in orbit for years and potentially for decades, posing a long-term threat to the ISS and more than 3,000 active satellites from multiple nations.The target of the Russian missile was a 1982 Soviet signals intelligence satellite that has been defunct for several decades, according to space industry analysis company Seradata.The test highlights a growing space arms race among global powers, encompassing everything from systems to counter missile defense systems to anti-satellite operations.In a sign of the strategic nature of the test, Space Command said Russia is developing and deploying capabilities to deny access to and use of space by the United States and its allies. “Russia's tests of direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons clearly demonstrate that Russia continues to pursue counterspace weapon systems that undermine strategic stability and pose a threat to all nations,” said Space Command commander James Dickinson. ""Russia, despite its claims of opposing the weaponization of outer space, is willing to jeopardize the long-term sustainability of outer space,” Blinken said, adding that the United States was discussing its response with partners.At the UN General Assembly in September last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested an agreement among space powers to prohibit the placement of weapons in space, as well as the threat or use of force against outer space objects.Anti-satellite weapons are high-tech missiles possessed by few nations.India was the last to carry out a test on a target in 2019, in a move strongly criticized by other powers, including the United States.The United States shot down a satellite in 2008 in response to China demonstrating a similar capability in 2007.The U.S. and India tests were carried at much lower altitudes -- well below the International Space Station -- than the one conducted by Russia.RFE/RL journalists report the news in 27 languages in 23 countries where a free press is banned by the government or not fully established.

What's inside?NASA's Perseverance rover — a car-sized robot carrying a slew of cameras and gadgets — ground away the surface of a Martian rock this week to peek at what's inside. The space agency tweeted out images of the distinct mark of human exploration now left on the desert planet: It's a circle-shaped abrasion (and there are others, too).An integral part of Perseverance's mission is to collect interesting and diverse samples of the rocky Martian surface, for a later mission to ferry back to Earth. By grinding away the surface of a rock, NASA's planetary scientists can better grasp the geologic history of an area, like how the rock formed and whether it existed in a watery environment. Over time, the extreme, windswept surface environs on Mars can obscure this past.""The unaltered rock below the surface may hold important clues to the history of the area,"" Iona Brockie, a sampling engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, wrote in a 2021 blog post.Ultimately, grinding away at rocks will lead scientists to the most promising, or interesting, samples to bring back home.The speckled, diverse insides of the rock are visible in NASA's new images. Once the drill makes a two-inch-wide hole, another instrument ""uses four short puffs to blow the cuttings away and reveal the fresh rock surface underneath,"" explained Brockie.A fundamental part of the Perseverance mission is to look for clues of past microbial life on Mars — should any have ever existed.

It sounds like a movie.NASA will soon test its ability to deflect a threatening asteroid away from our humble blue planet. The agency will slam a spacecraft the size of a vending machine into a space rock the size of a great Egyptian pyramid. The sci-fi-like endeavor is called the DART mission, or Double Asteroid Redirection Test, and the spacecraft launches quite soon, . It's humanity's first-ever attempt to purposefully move an asteroid. The rocky target, Dimorphos, is not a threat to Earth, but the mission is an experiment to see how civilization could alter the path of a menacing asteroid, should one be on a collision course with our planet. Though no known asteroid of at least 460 feet wide is a threat for the next century, a future strike, at some point, is inevitable. So the $330 million mission is crucial.""We are right now defenseless against any asteroid aiming for Earth,"" said Markus Wilde, an associate professor of aerospace, physics, and space sciences at the Florida Institute of Technology. Wilde is not involved in the mission.Slamming a spacecraft into Dimorphos may sound dramatic. But the goal is just to give Dimorphos a nudge. During a true deflection of an incoming asteroid, such a nudge would happen many years or decades in advance of the imminent collision. ""That's enough time to make sure it misses Earth,"" explained Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and one of DART's lead scientists. Over years, a tiny alteration in an asteroid's movement adds up to a big change in the ultimate trajectory.This strategy, of course, requires knowing what's coming. In good news, astronomers have already , and have discovered some 1,500 each year since 2015. ""We are right now defenseless against any asteroid aiming for Earth.""But in the coming few decades, many more rocks need to be found: Astronomers estimate that thousands of sizable asteroids over 460 feet wide remain unfound. Fortunately, astronomers have  (and counting) of the rocks half-a-mile wide or bigger — the kind that could spell catastrophe for large swathes of Earth. But the smaller, more elusive rocks still have a strong potential to sneak up on us. A rock some 187 to 427 feet across swooped by Earth in 2019 and surprised scientists. Such an impact could be devastating. Some 50,000 years ago, an asteroid 100 to 170 feet across left a 600-foot-deep crater in Arizona. ""A similar-size impact event today could destroy a city the size of Kansas City,"" David Kring, an impact expert at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, told NASA this year.""We need to be able to find these things early,"" emphasized Cathy Plesko, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory who researches asteroid impacts and is working on the DART mission. ""We're getting there, but we're not there yet.""At some 6.8 million miles from Earth, the DART spacecraft will hit the 525-foot-wide Dimorphos on around Oct. 1, 2022. But Dimorphos won't be alone. It's actually orbiting a much larger sibling, the half-mile-wide Didymos. For astronomers, this makes Dimorphos an ideal collision target. After the impact, which will spray rubble into space, scientists on Earth will use telescopes to gauge how much the collision (or ""nudge"") alters Dimorphos' orbit around Didymos. And that's the crux of the experiment: How much did we move the space rock? (Scientists hope to slow its orbit by several minutes, or even 10, over the course of a 12-hour orbit.)NASA will capture extreme footage of the grand 15,000 mph impact. Ten days before the strike, the DART spacecraft will release a toaster-sized ""CubeSat."" The small box will trail DART by a few minutes, allowing astronomers to see exactly what happens as a plume of rock is blasted through space.If NASA successfully slows down Dimorphos, it won't simply be an unprecedented, deep space achievement. It's proof to future generations that the planetary defense technique works. If a larger asteroid is discovered hurtling towards Earth in 2077, the same exact mission won't suffice, but space agencies can now better plan to deflect the incoming space rock. Maybe two spacecraft would have to be sent, said Plesko""It's the same principle. It would just be a matter of scaling it up,"" she said.To grasp how to deflect a variety of asteroids out there — some are hunks of rubble, some are masses of metal, some are bizarrely shaped — NASA may have to run a series of DART-like collisions in the coming decades, noted Wilde of the Florida Institute of Technology.Yet one thing is clear. Deflecting an asteroid years before it arrives is an optimal solution for defending Earth from a looming threat. What we don't want is an emergency. That could mean resorting to risky defensive measures, like launching a nuclear bomb into space to blow up a fast-approaching 700-foot-wide rock. Recent research based on computer simulations found such a nuclear detonation could actually blast away most of the threat. But there are unknowns and likely unintended consequences, noted Plesko, like the potential spawning of innumerable bullet-like micrometeorites that could . That would destroy civilization's invaluable communications, weather, and scientific satellites.A well-calculated asteroid deflection is preferable, and space scientists are thrilled the mission is about to launch. The $330 million price tag is well worth it, they say.""It's definitely worth its money,"" said Wilde",https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_in/article/n/nasas-sci-/nasas-sci-fi-mission-to-move-an-asteroid-is-crucial-for-huma_m622.1248.jpg,"Parker Solar Probe to become fastest human-made spacecraft flying at 5,86,800 kmph during closest approach to Sun - India Today
 The Parker Solar Probe, which is studying the Sun up close, is set to make its 10th close approach to our star on November 21. The spacecraft will break its own record during the flyby as it gains a staggering speed of 5,86,800 kilometres per hour.The spacecraft will come as close as. 8.5 million kilometres to the surface of the raging star as engineers queue up its science instruments to measure the properties of the solar wind near its source. The spacecraft is propelling towards the Sun after a swing past Venus on October 16, successfully using the planet’s gravity to “We are observing higher than expected amounts of dust near the Sun. What’s exciting about this is it’s greatly improving our understanding of the innermost regions of our heliosphere, giving us insight into an environment that, until now, was a total mystery,” said Nour Raouafi, Parker Solar Probe project scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL).Apart from tracking solar wind, the . Nasa said that as dust grains pelt the spacecraft along its path, the high-velocity impacts create clouds of plasma. These clouds produce unique electrical charges that are picked up by several sensors on the probe’s FIELDS instrument, which is designed to measure the electric and magnetic fields near the Sun.The visible imaging camera, WISPR, captures dust structures far away from the spacecraft, such as the dust ring that shares Venus’ orbit. WISPR and FIELDS have planned for specifically investigating near-Sun dust in a region of the solar system where no mission has ever operated.“We designed materials and components that survive hypervelocity dust impacts and the effects of the even smaller particles created in these impacts. We modelled the makeup and effects of the dust environment, tested how materials react to the dust particles, and installed fault-tolerant onboard systems that are keeping Parker Solar Probe safe in this unexplored region,” said Jim Kinnison, Parker Solar Probe mission systems engineer in a statement.The probe, when at its closest to the Sun, will be flying at 5,86,800 kilometres per hour thanks to the gravity assist from Venus last month. The spacecraft swooped 3,814 kilometres above Venus' surface to reduce its orbital energy, which in turn allows it to travel closer to the Sun and measure the properties of the solar wind near its source.This was the fifth of seven planned Venus gravity assists. Parker Solar Probe will break its own distance and speed records on November 21 closest approach, 1.9 million kilometres closer than the previous approach. Nasa said that assisted by two more Venus flybys, in August 2023 and November 2024, the Probe will eventually come within 6.2 million kilometres of the solar surface in December 2024.to study the Sun. With the new solar cycle beginning and a flurry of activities noted in recent weeks on the Sun, studying it has become critical to understanding space weather.Flying into the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere, known as the corona, for the first time, Parker Solar Probe will help us in understanding the origins and the evolution of the biggest star in our solar system.Named after Eugene Parker, who gave the concept of the solar wind, the spacecraft performs its scientific investigations in a hazardous region of intense heat and solar radiation.

"Android 12 is now available on these devices, with more coming soon - 9to5Google
YesterdayAndroid 12 has been available on some Google devices for a little bit now and has even made its way to a couple of Samsung Galaxy devices for download. Since the build became official back in October, manufacturers have been working to get Android 12 out and into the hands of their customers. 
The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro came with Android 12 out of the box, which means users who own a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro already have the new Android experience with the Material You and all the Pixel’s AI-driven glory. Other Pixel devices prior to the Pixel 6 also received updates for the new iteration of Android, making the update across the line.On the other hand, Samsung was the first manufacturer besides Google to roll out Android 12 in full to a device. Samsung has been long associated with the slow-draw when it comes to releasing new Android versions for its devices. It looks like it has turned the tables and started pushing Android 12 in its One UI 4 form already. It’s done this with the Samsung Galaxy S21 series, after going through a beta testing phase with more to come in time.Here is the full list of devices that can upgrade to Android 12 right now:It is worth mentioning that some carriers may delay Android availability for Samsung devices.As mentioned, Samsung has a few devices in beta before rolling out the full versions. Fortunately, it doesn’t look like these devices will stay in beta for very long, as the Galaxy S21 series was in beta for a short time before moving on to the full One UI 4. Other manufacturers like ASUS have started testing Android 12 beta on certain devices as well. OnePlus and Oppo have also entered a beta testing phase for some devices, though the beta availability is limited. Here’s the current list of devices with an Android 12 beta available:Note that OnePlus had initiated a closed beta for OnePlus 8T and OnePlus 8 series owners. That beta has since reached capacity and is no longer open to any new users.Of course, Samsung’s list of devices currently in beta will most definitely move into full One UI 4. The full list of devices from Samsung getting the Android 12 update is even larger and encompasses the whole foldable portfolio, as well as other devices up to two years old. As discovered earlier, most of the newer devices will be receiving their update around December 2021 and January of 2022, with the timeline extending all the way into July of 2022.It is worth mentioning that carriers may delay the Android 12 rollout for some Samsung devices during the course of the release. Since carriers like Verizon like to add certain elements to the build, new software can take a little longer to reach the user after going through its own testing phase with the carrier. So the timeline Samsung has suggested may not prove to be completely accurate depending on your location and service provider. This shouldn’t affect unlocked devices, since those are the most reliably able to take part in the beta.Another company that has announced its upgrade game plan for Android 12 is ASUS. Back in October, the company announced that the Zenfone 8 series will be getting Android 12 in December 2021, while other devices will receive the update throughout 2022. Here’s the list and timeline we know so far:As far as when the X3 Pro from Oppo will leave beta, the company has specified that it will get the full release around mid-November. This will be followed by the Find X2 Pro series and the Reno6 series around late November.Finally, OnePlus announced the list of phones to receive the update in time. These will all receive OxygenOS 12 in time with no specifics on the timeframe:Even if companies haven’t announced timelines for their devices, we will likely start seeing upgrades to Android 12 sometime in the first half of 2022 for most newer phones. It’s also worth noting that manufacturers like Samsung and OnePlus usually promise a certain number of years of updates to come for devices. For instance, Samsung promises three years of Android updates, keeping the software as new as possible. For OnePlus devices such as the OnePlus 8 series and the OnePlus 9 series, the company promises three years of Android updates as well.",https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2021/11/Pixel-4-XL-in-Clearly-White-with-Pixel-6-in-Sorta-Seafoam.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1000,"Over 20 Android apps found with dangerous PhoneSpy spyware, you should delete them now - India Today
 A new spyware may be targeting your Android phone and trying to steal your personal data, researchers have found. PhoneSpy is a new spyware campaign that has most South Korean users of Android devices in clutches right now, but it will only be a matter of time till it spreads elsewhere. Researchers have noted that this spyware does not leverage existing vulnerabilities of a device but hides in plain sight on it by posing as a legitimate app, such as one for yoga instructions or streaming videos.The biggest risk that PhoneSpy could be posing to your Android phone is by stealthily uninstalling mobile security apps, researchers at mobile security firm Zimperium have discovered. PhoneSpy was found hiding inside as many as 23 apps that look benign and genuine, much like any other legitimate Android app. But it can do more harm than just stealing the identity of Android apps. Researchers said PhoneSpy can access the camera of the phone it has targeted and use it to take photos and record videos in real time without the user's knowledge. These photos and videos could be a way to commit personal or corporate blackmail, but they can also be used to commit cyber-espionage.According to researchers, these are the apps that have been found carrying the PhoneSpy spyware:That is scary as it is, but users can stay alert by noticing some unusual instances when they have mistakenly downloaded PhoneSpy-infected apps. These apps ask for excessive on-device permissions and that should be a red flag for you. But if you miss noticing that and give these apps the permissions they ask for, you would be allowing PhoneSpy to control and hide itself from your phone’s app menu and track you in the background. Since the apps are not visible in the app menu, users cannot interrupt PhoneSpy’s stealing process, Zimperium’s Richard Melick told TechCrunch.PhoneSpy has apparently still not made its way to the Google Play Store. Neither was it found inside other app marketplaces on Android. But, according to researchers, spyware is spreading to phones through distribution methods based on web traffic redirection or social engineering. Simply put, these are different tactics that attackers use to lure people into performing certain actions for a reward, but victims end up downloading phony apps. There are also high chances victims will hand over their personal and confidential data while completing these actions.Right now the headcount of victims stands at 1,000, but all of them are in South Korea, according to Zimperium. But who knows when it will spread and start claiming more innocent Android phone users? Since PhoneSpy belongs to the category of spyware that masquerades as legitimate apps, it is very hard to track it. It also shares similarities with previously-discovered spyware and stalkware programmes, which, according to researchers, could be a way to compile and combine different features from different programmes by attackers. Using off-the-shelf codes makes it easy to hide the identity of the spyware.Zimperium claims to have told off authorities in South Korea and the US, but the spyware is as active and spreading fast. So, keep away from suspicious apps if you do not want your data to be stolen for all nefarious reasons.Click here for IndiaToday.in’s ",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/../sites/all/themes/itg/images/itg_image88x50.jpg,"Google reportedly cancels orders with suppliers for Pixel Fold - GSMArena.com news - GSMArena.com

Just like the original report about the Pixel Fold happening, and then this report that says it isn’t, it’s all speculation.Google perhaps figured it was not the right time to compete in the foldables space during a time where supply chains are still feeling constraints. At the same time, the cost of many components has risen over the last couple of years, making it more of a challenge to compete with Samsung’s third-generation flagship foldable: the Galaxy Z Fold3.We were excited when we first heard that Google was developing its own Pixel foldable device.

"Delhi pollution: SC asks Centre to hold meet today, says ‘unfortunate’ it has to set agenda - The Indian Express
WITH THE Centre stating that dust, vehicular transport and industry were the major contributors to the air pollution that has choked the national capital, the Supreme Court asked the Government to hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to decide on how to tackle the situation.Referring to an affidavit filed by the Centre, a bench headed by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana said: “…with respect to stubble burning, all affidavits indicate contribution is not much. However, there is a good amount of stubble burning taking place in Punjab and Haryana. We request states to pursue farmers not to burn stubble for two weeks.”The bench, also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, expressed its unhappiness over the executive not being able to take concrete steps to tackle the crisis and said “it is very unfortunate we have to set the agenda for them”.The court will hear the matter next on November 17. Since Sunday, Delhi’s air quality has been in the “very poor” category, and it is expected to remain in that zone for at least three more days.On Monday, the CJI told Advocate Rahul Mehra, who appeared for the Delhi government: “Pollution levels have to come down immediately. That is the main concern. How you do it is your problem.” Mehra said Delhi was ready to impose a lockdown as suggested by the court during the previous hearing.“Centre and three states (Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh), you must come up with a complete proposal. If you don’t, then don’t blame us for giving directions,” said Justice Surya Kant.The court also took exception to the Delhi government’s reply to a query on the number of mechanised road sweepers — that the 69 machines are being operated by the municipal corporation, which could also be asked to file an affidavit.Justice Surya Kant said: “…you are passing the buck to the municipal corporation. This kind of lame excuse will force us to order an audit of your revenue earnings and how it is spent on populist slogans instead of this (buying machines, etc)”.At the previous hearing, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre and Delhi governments to appraise it on emergency measures to tackle the Air Quality Index (AQI) and whether steps like a lockdown or stopping vehicles can be taken.On Monday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the bench that steps have to be taken by states as well. A response action plan has been implemented since 2016 and is showing results, he said.

He pointed out that stubble burning by farmers now contributes only 10 per cent to pollution and that dust is one of the major contributors.Justice Surya Kant said: “This can only be a long-term plan…The situation is imminent and emergency steps are required to be taken.” He asked Mehta about “drastic measures” that are scientifically possible and can be taken by the Centre and states.The introduction of an odd-even scheme, stopping entry of trucks into Delhi and, at worst, a lockdown, Mehta replied. “Why not (stop) entry or plying of all vehicles for a few days?” asked Justice Surya Kant.Asked which factor contributed the most to air pollution in the national capital, Mehta said: “76 per cent is due to three factors — dust, industry and transport”.Justice Chandrachud referred to an affidavit filed by the Centre and said stubble burning contributes only four per cent to pollution and that “dust, vehicular transport and industry are the three factors that have to be targeted if you have to achieve results in a few days”.Mehta sought to clarify that the contribution of stubble burning was 10 per cent and that it continues for two months. “If you take some steps regarding these issues, we will ask the state governments to take care of the stubble burning,” Justice Chandrachud said.Later, Senior Advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for petitioner Aditya Dubey, said it was a “wrong statement” that stubble burning contributed to only 10 per cent pollution.He cited the minutes of Sunday’s meeting of the air quality management panel, presided over by its chairman M M Kutty, which states: “…efforts need to be intensified to control the instances of stubble burning to minimum as currently the paddy stubble burning has been contributing about 35%-40% of the total pollution load in Delhi-NCR.”Earlier, on Rahul Mehtra’s reference to the municipal corporation on the need for buying new mechanised road sweepers, Justice Surya Kant said that in some other proceedings, the corporation had said that it did not have the money even to pay salaries.
Mehra, after taking instructions, said the Delhi government has agreed to sanction funds immediately if proposals for buying new machines are made. But the court said it wanted to see “definite numbers”.The bench asked the Centre to decide by Tuesday evening on the non-essential industries that can be shut, vehicles that can be stopped, etc.The CJI referred to the Delhi government ordering work from home for its employees and said the Centre should look at following suit since the capital has a large number of its employees.Justice Surya Kant told Punjab’s counsel that its affidavit was silent on incentives for farmers to avoid burning stubble, total area under cultivation, machines needed to remove stubble, etc.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/11/Smog-2.jpg,"Gujarat CM says ‘no problem’ with non-veg food even as street vendors cry out for help - India Today

They can do so if they are obstructing traffic on city roads,” he said.The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has decided to remove non-veg food stalls from public roads and those operating 100 metres from schools and religious places.
