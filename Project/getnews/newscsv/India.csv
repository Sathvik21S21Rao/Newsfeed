"NCLAT admits Venugopal Dhoot petition against Anil Agarwal's Twin Star takeover bid - Moneycontrol
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has admitted the petition filed by former Videocon group Chairman and Managing Director Venugopal Dhoot challenging the earlier order of the insolvency court NCLT approving Rs 2,962 crore takeover bid for its 13 group companies by Anil Agarwal's Twin Star Technologies.The appellate tribunal has issued notices to the resolution professional, lenders and Twin Star Technologies directing them to file a reply by September 17.""Let the matter be listed 'for hearing' on September 20, 2021,"" added a two-member bench comprising Justice J K Jain and A K Mishra.Earlier on June 9, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved Rs 2,962 crore takeover bid by Twin Star Technologies for the 13 companies of the debt-ridden Videocon group.However, the NCLT order was stayed by the appellate tribunal on July 19 over the petitions filed by two dissatisfied creditors of the Videocon Group - Bank of Maharashtra and IFCI Ltd and had directed to maintain ""status quo ante"".Earlier this week, on September 7, the NCLAT has extended the stay till September 20, the next date of hearing in the issue.Dhoot, in its plea filed before the NCLAT has requested to set aside the order passed by the Mumbai bench of the NCLT and to direct the lenders to consider Rs 31,789 crore settlement plan submitted by him under section 12 of the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC).In the petition, Dhoot has questioned the role played by the Resolution Professional and said that he should have mentioned the foreign oil and gas assets of Videocon Group in the Information memorandum (Tender Form) to all the bidders and hence no valuation was considered.He had also requested NCLT's order approving Twin Star Technologies' resolution plan to be cancelled and a fresh resolution plan to be considered with Oil and Consumer Durable assets.During the hearing, which took place on September 10, all parties opposed Dhoot's claims.Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Senior Counsel for Resolution Applicant (Twin Star), has stated the Appellant (Dhoot) drove the company to zero and whose proposal under 12A of the Code was rejected by a very high majority of CoC. Their proposal was for repayment in 15-20 years,"" the NCLAT order said.While the CoC stated that Twin Star's proposal was approved with 95 per cent majority and said few financial creditors and the guarantors and shareholders are approaching for nullifying the approved Resolution Plan.Under Section 12A of the IBC, the tribunal can permit withdrawal of an ongoing insolvency process against a company subject to certain conditions. Such application is filed by the company with the approval of 90 per cent voting share of the committee of creditors.Videocon Industries and its 12 group companies had a total admitted claims of Rs 64,838.63 crore.Earlier, In its 47-page-long judgement, NCLT while approving Twin Star Technologies' Rs 2,962.02 crore-bid had observed creditors of debt-ridden Videocon Industries Ltd will be taking nearly 96 per cent haircut on their loans and the bidder is ""paying almost nothing.",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"Top Cryptocurrencies to Buy this Weekend - Analytics Insight
It all started with a few cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and today there is a vast list of such currencies that people are keen to invest in. With differing degrees of utility, adoption and promise, the cryptocurrency market has managed to garner attention from every corner of the globe. The attention and popularity that the digital currencies enjoy has surely made investors decipher as to which are the . On that note, we present to you our find of the top cryptocurrencies to buy this weekend. Keep reading. BitcoinEver since this cryptocurrency came into existence, no wonder, it has been a dominant player. Not just the retail investors but institutional investors are also making their way into Bitcoin investment. Additionally, Bitcoin is considered to be a medium for countries to guard against currency depreciation as well as faster and cheaper fund transfer across borders. Being the one with the largest market capitalization, Bitcoin, undoubtedly holds huge potential for positive returns, just like it has strived to do to date. EthereumAfter Bitcoin, undoubtedly, all eyes turn to Ethereum – the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. Ethereum has already made the headlines by being the leading platform for decentralized finance, or DeFi. With this platform, the users can now create smart contracts that get executed automatically when the conditions are met. Yet another aspect that makes Ethereum stand apart from the rest is its potential to cut out third parties like banks, clearing houses, banks, etc. As the investors have gained quite a good return as a result of their investment in Ethereum, the same trend is likely to continue for the years ahead. CardanoJust like Ethereum, Cardano is also a decentralized blockchain platform that enables peer-to-peer transactions. A point that is worth noting is that these transactions are extremely secure. What has paved the way for the wide acceptance of Cardano across the globe is its extremely low level of energy consumption when compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin. Cardano is on its way to enabling smart contracts, thereby leaving us with no doubts pertaining to how valuable investing in this digital currency would turn out to be. DogecoinThe exponential surge in the value of Dogecoin over a period of time speaks volumes as to how good of an investment this meme coin is. Its larger circulation as well as the unlimited capacity to mine more has always been the prime reason for all the attention that Dogecoin enjoys. Yet another point to note is that Dogecoin has a much faster mining/hash rate as compared to Bitcoin, thus making sense to the kind of attention it enjoys.

The EcoSport did not last long in its homeland until a decision had been made not to continue its production.
The EcoSport did not last long in its homeland until a decision had been made not to continue its production. Ford EcoSport will remain available in the United States until mid 2022, as reported by The Detroit Free Press. In Europe, the production will take place in Romania maintaining models of the range there. The reason for this decision is that the EcoSport has not been a success in the sales of the Ford company , despite having been one of the most iconic trucks of the brand a few years ago and capturing the lives of thousands of people, now this automobile will cease to exist or at least in its native land. Ford had showcased the EcoSport in US in 2016, and launched it for the first time in 2018. Over the years, the sub-compact SUV’s success declined. As of last year, the North American company was reducing the units it manufactured, apparently the truck was replaced in sales by the Bronco Sport range and Ford did not wait long to dismantle it. At launch, it was seen with a 1.0-litre three-cylinder turbo engine and a 2.0-litre four-cylinder, available with all-wheel drive. Now, ditching the EcoSport allows space within Ford's production to develop other vehicles. In India, Ford EcoSport subcompact SUV has been one of the best-selling vehicles from the US-based carmaker. It was launched in the country for the first time in 2013. The carmaker has been spotted testing in what is believed to be a new facelift version of the EcoSport SUV recently.

The heavy industries ministry has asked US-based electric car major Tesla to first start manufacturing its iconic electric vehicles in India before any tax concessions can be considered, government sources said. They said that the government is not giving such concessions to any auto firm and giving duty benefits to Tesla will not send a good signal to other companies that have invested billions of dollars in India.
 (Also read | ) Tesla has demanded reduction in import duties on electric vehicles (EVs) in India. At present, cars imported as completely built units (CBUs) attract customs duty ranging from 60 per cent to 100 per cent, depending on engine size and cost, insurance and freight (CIF) value less or above USD 40,000. In a letter to the road ministry, the US firm had stated that the effective import tariff of 110 per cent on vehicles with customs value above USD 40,000 is ""prohibitive"" to zero-emission vehicles. It has requested the government to standardize the tariff on electric cars to 40 per cent irrespective of the customs value, and withdraw the social welfare surcharge of 10 per cent on electric cars. It has stated that these changes would boost the development of the Indian EV ecosystem and the company will make significant direct investments in sales, service, and charging infrastructure; and significantly increase procurement from India for its global operations. (Also read | ) The company has argued that these proposals would not have any negative impact on the Indian automotive market as no Indian OEM currently produces a car (EV or ICE) with ex-factory price above USD 40,000 and only 1-2 per cent of cars sold in India (EV or ICE) have ex-factory/customs value above USD 40,000. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari had said Tesla has a golden opportunity to set up its manufacturing facility in India given the country's thrust on e-vehicles.

"Explained: What a CDC report says about vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant - The Indian Express
On Friday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report that monitored the incidence of Covid-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths by individuals’ vaccination status from April 4 to July 17 across 13 jurisdictions.This is the time when Covid-19 cases due to the  had started to surge in the country. In the US, three vaccines are being administered currently, including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson’s single-dose vaccine.The report has come just around the time when US President Joe Biden announced new federal coronavirus vaccine requirements as the country is struggling to contain the highly infectious Delta variant of Covid-19. of employees of federal government and large private sector companies. The mandates are not being welcomed by everyone, especially some members and supporters of the Republican party, who see them as infringing their freedom.As per latest data from the CDC, 53.6 percent of people in the US are fully vaccinated and 62.9 percent have at least one dose of the vaccine.What the CDC report saysBroadly, the report says that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalisation, and death is higher in unvaccinated than vaccinated persons. It also says that the incidence rate ratios of the disease are related to vaccine effectiveness.In other words, the report posits that while vaccine effectiveness against infection may have fallen because of the Delta variant, vaccines are still significantly effective in protecting against severe disease and death from Covid-19.In the 13 jurisdictions that were assessed, between April 4 and July 19, over 569,142 Covid-19 cases were reported among the unvaccinated people. These cases were 92 percent of the total cases detected during the time. Significantly, 34,972 hospitalisations (92 percent) and 6,132 COVID-19 associated deaths (91 percent) were also reported among the unvaccinated people.In contrast, cases among fully vaccinated people numbered at 46,312 or eight percent of the total. 2,976 hospitalisations were reported among them and 616 deaths.Newsletter | Overall, during the period between April 4 and June 19, fully vaccinated persons accounted for 5 percent of the cases, 7 percent of hospitalizations and 8 percent of deaths. At this time, the vaccination coverage was 37 percent in the areas surveyed. The report notes that assuming vaccine effectiveness of 90 percent, vaccinated people should have contributed 6 percent of the total cases.What other studies have said about the Delta variant and vaccine effectivenessA study published in the journal Nature this month says that the Delta variant has a much higher ability to infect, and to evade the immune response gained through previous infections or vaccines. As of now, the Delta variant, or the B.1.617.2 lineage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first discovered in Maharashtra and fuelled the second wave in the country.It is now dominant not just in India but also in several other countries. According to the World Health Organization, the Delta variant is now present in at least 170 countries.Another study carried out in the UK found that the Astra-Zeneca vaccine, which has been administered to the majority of the vaccine recipients in India and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offer considerable protection against the Delta variant, even though their effectiveness wanes over time.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/09/vaccination-5.jpg,"Four factors that increase the risk of vaccinated people getting COVID - EastMojo
Norwich (UK): Two weeks after your second COVID-19 vaccine dose, the protective effects of vaccination will be at their highest.At this point, you’re fully vaccinated. If you still get COVID-19 after this point, you’ve suffered a breakthrough infection. Broadly speaking, breakthrough infections are similar to regular COVID-19 infections in unvaccinated people but there are some differences. Here is what to look out for if you’ve had both jabs.According to the COVID Symptom Study, the five most common symptoms of a breakthrough infection are a headache, a runny nose, sneezing, a sore throat and loss of smell. Some of these are the same symptoms that people who haven’t had a vaccine experience. If you haven’t been vaccinated, three of the most common symptoms are also a headache, sore throat and runny nose.However, the two other most common symptoms in the unvaccinated are fever and a persistent cough. These two classic COVID-19 symptoms become much less common once you’ve had your jabs. One study has found that people with breakthrough infections are 58% less likely to have a fever compared with unvaccinated people. Rather, COVID-19 after vaccination has been described as feeling like a head cold for many.Vaccinated people are also less likely than unvaccinated people to be hospitalised if they develop COVID-19. They’re also likely to have fewer symptoms during the initial stages of the illness and are less likely to develop long COVID.The reasons for the disease being milder in vaccinated people could be because vaccines if they don’t block infection, seem to lead to infected people having fewer virus particles in their bodies. However, this has yet to be confirmed.In the UK, research has found that 0.2% of the population or one person in every 500 experiences a breakthrough infection once fully vaccinated. But not everyone is at the same risk. Four things appear to contribute to how well you are protected by vaccination.1. Vaccine typeThe first is the specific vaccine type you received and the relative risk reduction that each type offers. Relative risk reduction is a measure of how much a vaccine reduces the risk of someone developing COVID-19 compared to someone who didn’t get vaccinated.Clinical trials found that the Moderna vaccine reduced a person’s risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 94%, while the Pfizer vaccine reduced this risk by 95%. The Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines performed less well, reducing this risk by about 66% and 70% respectively (though protection offered by the AstraZeneca vaccine appeared to rise to 81% if a longer gap was left between doses).2. Time since the vaccinationBut these figures don’t paint the complete picture. It’s becoming increasingly evident that length of time since vaccination is also important and is one of the reasons why the debate over booster immunisations is growing in intensity.Early research, still in the preprint (and so yet to be reviewed by other scientists), suggests that the Pfizer vaccine’s protection wanes over the six months following vaccination. Another preprint from Israel also suggests that this is the case. It’s too soon to know what happens to vaccine efficacy beyond six months in the double vaccinated, but it’s likely to reduce further.3. VariantsAnother important factor is the variant of the virus that you’re facing. The reductions in risk above were calculated largely by testing vaccines against the original form of the coronavirus.But when facing the alpha variant, data from Public Health England suggests that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are slightly less protective, reducing the risk of getting COVID-19 symptoms by 93%. Against delta, the level of protection falls even further, to 88%. The AstraZeneca vaccine is also affected this way.The COVID Symptom Study backs all of this up. Its data suggests in the two to four weeks after receiving your second Pfizer jab, you’re around 87% less likely to get COVID-19 symptoms when facing delta. After four to five months, that figure falls to 77%.4. Your immune systemIt’s important to remember that the above figures refer to average risk reduction across a population. Your own risk will depend on your own levels of immunity and other person-specific factors (such as how exposed you are to the virus, which might be determined by your job).Immune fitness typically reduces with age. Long-term medical conditions may also impair our response to vaccination. Older people or people with compromised immune systems may therefore have lower levels of vaccine-induced protection against COVID-19 or may see their protection wane more quickly.It’s also worth remembering that the most clinically vulnerable received their vaccines first, possibly over eight months ago, which may heighten their risk of experiencing a breakthrough infection due to protection waning.Vaccines still vastly reduce your chances of getting COVID-19. They also to an even greater degree protect against hospitalisation and death.However, it’s concerning seeing breakthrough infections, and the worry is that they might increase if vaccine protection does, as suspected, fall over time.Hence the UK government is planning to give a booster dose to those most vulnerable and is also considering whether boosters should be given more widely. Other countries, including France and Germany, are already planning on offering boosters to groups considered to be at higher risk from COVID-19.But even boosters end up being used, this shouldn’t be interpreted as vaccines not working. And in the meantime, it’s essential to promote vaccination to all those eligible who have not yet been vaccinated.

 As Firozabad district in Uttar Pradesh continues to battle dengue and viral fever outbreak, the state government on Friday suspended health officer of the municipal corporation here and sealed clinics of unauthorised medical practitioners.According to government records, 57 people, mostly children, have so far died due to the diseases, while 404 people are still undergoing treatment in the medical college hospital here.“As many as 120 new patients were admitted on Friday while 102 people were discharged after recovery,” medical college principal Sangeeta Aneja said, adding that of the 195 tests done for dengue, 62 have been found positive.ALSO READ: Taking a strong view of the prevailing situation, the administration suspended Nagar Swasthya Adhikari Mukesh Kumar with immediate effect for abstaining from duty without any prior information.“Since September 3, Kumar has been abstaining from duty without any information and also during the recent visit of Additional Chief Secretary (Medical and Education) Alok Kumar, he was not there,” Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dinesh Kumar Premi said.“The Director of Medical and Health Services, Ravinder Singh was asked to investigate the matter and on the basis of the report submitted on Thursday, Kumar has been suspended with immediate effect,” he said.ALSO READ: With a view to ensure that all patients get proper medical treatment, District Magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh and City Magistrate Gulshan Kumar visited Humayunpur, Suhag Nagar and other localities of the city and requested the people not to get treatment from unauthorised doctors.The clinics of eight quacks were sealed by the city magistrate, a spokesman said.According to Aneja, the number of patients has come down following concerted efforts of the administration and the government and it is visible in the flow of patients in the medical college hospital.On the directives of the government, S N Singh of KGMU, Lucknow has been camping in Firozabad since the past five days to ascertain the type of fever among the patients.ALSO READ: Talking to media, Singh said in the investigation so far, it has been found that the outbreak of viral fever and dengue was due to the abundance of mosquitoes in the region.“The investigation is going on and only after reaching some conclusion, I will be able to say more,” he said, adding that he will submit his report to the government.In a related development, locals complained that medicines past their expiry dates were distributed by doctors at primary health centre at Dhanpura of Shikohabad tehsil on Tuesday.Villagers also showed the expired medicines to the media following which CMO Premi said directives have been given to take action in the matter after investigation.Prima facie, it has been found that the medicines were distributed by physiotherapist Vijay Kumar on his own and an explanation has been sought from him. Further action will be taken after getting the clarification, he said.Firozabad, around 50 km from Agra and 320 km from state capital Lucknow, has been battling the outbreak of dengue and deadly viral fever for the past three weeks now, with most of the victims being children.Some cases have also been found in neighbouring Mathura, Agra and Mainpuri, according to officials.WATCH: Click here for IndiaToday.in’s ",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/../sites/all/themes/itg/images/itg_image88x50.jpg,"Guide to eat right: Cutting through the cholesterol confusion - The Indian Express
High blood cholesterol level is a known risk factor for heart diseases. Decade-old nutritional guidelines suggested dietary cholesterol as one of the major contributors to elevate the blood cholesterol level. However, these guidelines are now challenged by recent scientific revelation and negate dietary cholesterol as a significant contributing factor to cardiovascular diseases for most people.Here, we discuss current scientific evidence to understand the role of dietary cholesterol in elevating blood lipid levels and the risk of heart diseases.Blood cholesterol and dietary cholesterol are differentAccording to , cholesterol that circulates in the blood is a waxy, fat-like substance, produced by the liver when needed. Dietary cholesterol is found in animal foods, such as meats, liver and other organ meats, full-fat dairy, egg yolks, and shellfish and is absorbed in relatively small amounts. Cholesterol is vital to perform multiple physiological functions, synthesise hormones and Vitamin D.What research saysA systematic review of 40 studies by Samantha Berger and colleagues found consumption of cholesterol-containing foods was not associated with any coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, or hemorrhagic stroke.In a review article titled ‘Rethinking dietary cholesterol’, Maria L Fernandez suggested reconsidering the common notion to limit dietary cholesterol in controlling blood cholesterol. On the contrary, in the case of some people, high cholesterol foods were found to elevate blood cholesterol level. A randomised control trial included g 40 men of 18 to 57 years of age and put them on an egg-based diet. The study reported a section of men with a specific genetic makeup had elevated cholesterol level than the others. Authors classified the former section of men as ‘hyperresponders’ and derived a conclusion that additional dietary cholesterol is not linked to an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis in healthy men.Dietary cholesterol and heart diseasesSound scientific evidence shows no association between dietary cholesterol and development of heart diseases. In fact, the popular notion of dietary cholesterol consumption and elevated risk of heart diseases seems over-exaggerated in light of this evidence such as a comprehensive review of Harvard egg study and other similar data.Eggs are the powerhouse of nutrition with the presence of all essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals. A large egg contains about 186 milligrams of cholesterol, but only . For decades, eggs have been barred from typical high-cholesterol diets due to cholesterol content.However, there is lack of scientific evidence that could link eggs with elevated cholesterol levels or increased risk of heart diseases. A  included 1032 men aged 42-60 years and assessed their dietary intake from a 4-day food record. The result revealed egg intake was not associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease, even in 32.5 per cent ApoE4 carriers who were highly susceptible individuals.A very large data published by JAMA involved 37,851 men aged between 40 and 75 years, and 80,082 women aged between 34 and 59 years, and assessed the association between incidence of heart diseases and egg consumption by a food frequency questionnaire. This data concluded that consumption of up to 1 egg per day is not associated with risk of coronary heart disease or stroke among healthy men and women.On the contrary, multiple researchers found eggs to be lowering the risk of heart diseases. A study by the British Medical Journal analysed eight articles and found that consuming up to one egg per day was not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke.

SEARCHLANGUAGEFOLLOW US ONFEEDBACKBlockbuster filmmaker Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi was all set to release on March 24, 2020. Sadly, the Coronavirus-induced lockdown spoiled the release plan. It’s been more than 1 ½ years and the Akshay Kumar starrer still hasn’t seen a release. Meanwhile, Rohit Shetty scripted and shot another film in the interim, titled Cirkus. It is said to be an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play, ‘The Comedy of Errors’ and stars Ranveer Singh, Varun Sharma, Pooja Hegde and Jacqueline Fernandez.Earlier this year, there were reports that Deepika Padukone will have a cameo appearance in Cirkus and that she’ll also appear in a song. Now, a source has shared a very interesting detail about the superstar actress’ appearance in the film. The source informed Bollywood Hungama, “It is said that Deepika Padukone will reprise her character of Meenamma from Chennai Express (2013). It was also directed by Rohit Shetty and it ranks as one of the finest performances of her career. Nowadays, it’s rare to see actresses in a memorable, comic role. Meenamma was one such character that was unanimously loved and it’ll be interesting to see Deepika in that part in a funny film like Cirkus.”A trade expert said, “Ranveer Singh and her wife Deepika Padukone are one of the hottest pairs of Bollywood. To see them together, even if it’s for one scene or song, will enhance the excitement for the film. And if Deepika will play Meenamma, it’ll be sone pe suhaga. One has to give it to Rohit Shetty. He thinks of such interesting stuff and he knows how to pull audiences to cinemas, whether it is getting Inspector Singham in Simmba (2018) or getting Singham and Simmba both in Sooryavanshi or getting Meenamma in Cirkus. Whenever it’ll release, it’s sure to generate tremendous hype.”Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone will also be seen together in another film, ’83, wherein the former plays Kapil Dev and the latter his wife. Deepika Padukone is also a co-producer on this much-awaited sports film that is expected to release in cinemas in 2021-end. Cirkus, meanwhile, might not make it this year and will arrive in theatres in 2022.Also Read: Catch us for latest Bollywood News, New Bollywood Movies update, Box office collection, New Movies Release , Bollywood News Hindi, Entertainment News, Bollywood News Today & upcoming movies 2020  and stay updated with latest hindi movies only on Bollywood Hungama.",https://media3.bollywoodhungama.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/SCOOP-The-REAL-reason-why-Deepika-Padukone-and-Ranbir-Kapoor-are-not-doing-Sanjay-Leela-Bhansalis-Baiju-Bawra-322x322.jpeg

They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Arthritis drug cuts death risk in high-risk patientsNASA rover Perseverance collects first Martian rock sampleNASA's Mars science rover Perseverance has collected and stashed away the first of numerous mineral samples that the U.S. space agency hopes to retrieve from the surface of the Red Planet for analysis on Earth. Tools attached to Perseverance and operated by mission specialists from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles drilled a rock core slightly thicker than a pencil from an ancient Martian lake bed, then hermetically sealed it in a titanium specimen tube inside the rover.Virgin Galactic sees delay to space mission with Italian Air ForceVirgin Galactic Holdings Inc on Friday flagged a delay to its first commercial research mission with the Italian Air Force to mid-October due to a potential manufacturing defect. The company also attributed the delay in the mission, named ""Unity 23"", to the pending resolution of a probe by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).All jokes aside, scientists find talking duckA Dutch scientist has uncovered old recordings of a musk duck mimicking the phrase, ""You bloody fool!"" - learnt when it was raised by humans in an Australian bird park. Leiden University scientist Carel Ten Cate said that what was interesting about the vocal expression of the waterfowl, nicknamed ""Ripper"", was not so much the message, but that he could imitate humans at all.'Flying Dragon' dinosaur roamed the southern skies too, scientists sayScientists in Chile's Atacama Desert have unearthed the fossil remains of a so-called ""flying dragon,"" a Jurassic-era dinosaur previously known only to the northern hemisphere.

The attacks of September 11, 2001, were an American national tragedy triggered by the terror outfit al-Qaeda, which resulted in the loss of lives of thousands of people and changed the American culture forever.Interestingly, at the time when the 9/11 attack took place, NASA had a crew in outer space, which began to monitor the event as soon as they were informed about the incident. Expedition 3 Commander Frank Culbertson was stationed at the International Space Station and was the only American on the crew.As Commander Frank Culbertson was at the International Space Station when he was informed about the attacks, he began to closely observe the terror attack by capturing photographs. Luckily, the station was hovering over the Manhattan area, thus it made the process a bit easier. He captured many images during the attack and saw the world change within minutes in front of him.Astronaut Frank Culbertson (in the middle) and his crewNASA released a video on their YouTube channel back in 2013 where they first revealed that the International Space Station had documented the terror attack. The video is also an emotional tribute to the lives lost during the 9/11 attacks and talks about how NASA collaborated with the American Government and military for other high-profile missions like infiltrating Afghanistan. Station Astronaut Frank Culbertson again talks about his observations and the breath-taking images he clicked from the ISS of the 9/11 attacks.Later, he talked regarding the images he clicked, ""The smoke seemed to have an odd bloom to it at the base of the column that was streaming south of the city. After reading one of the news articles we just received, I believe we were looking at NY around the time of, or shortly after, the collapse of the second tower. How horrible!”He further said that before he was informed about the attack, he looked at the debris and saw a big cloud of dust and smoke across the Manhattan Area. He said that after seeing the aftermath of the attack, it was too painful for him because it was like a “wound in the side of your country, of your family or of your friends.”'The 9/11 attacks as seen from the spaceNASA wanted to pay a proper tribute to the victims of the 9/11 attack and did exactly on the tenth anniversary of the attack by taking an American flag on metal recovered from the site of the World Trade Centre towers and placing it on the surface of the planet Mars. The flag was recovered shortly after the destruction of the towers on Sept. 11, 2001, and it was taken to Mars on Sept. 11, 2011.NASA later said, “NASA wanted to come up with an appropriate tribute to the people who lost their lives in the tragic events of September 11. America's space program has a long history of carrying items into space to commemorate historic events, acts of courage and dramatic achievements.” ",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/dtgotugh5x3udllc_1631367222.jpeg,"Solar storm may hit Earth! Double whammy to destroy your Internet, electricity - HT Tech
A prediction, based on research, has it that a massive solar storm, dubbed a solar superstorm, is likely to hit Earth in the near future and it will be catastrophic for humanity. A solar storm is a powerful jet of mass and energy shot from the Sun and if Earth finds itself in the line of fire, it will suffer consequences that have never been seen before. This kind of a massive solar storm can easily strike a double blow and knock out the Internet and electricity. From satellites circling the Earth, to sea cables underneath the oceans and electrical infrastructure on the ground, all of it is under threat. And how big is the threat? Well, according to research, the Sun has been benign for decades and now it is waking up from slumber and a solar storm is likely coming soon.While we all live with a slow internet on a daily basis, and power is knocked out in similar fashion everywhere, the thing with a solar storm is that it will knock out the infrastructure for months. In short, what we are staring at is an Internet apocalypse!What proof is there that a solar storm of such a nature with a potential for wreaking such havoc is actually coming? In ""Solar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse"", a research paper by Indian origin scientist Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi of the University of California, Irvine, and VMware Research, has stated that there is a 1.6 to 12% chance of a solar storm happening soon - in the next decade itself! Jyothi made a clarion call for all nations to start preparing here and now as later it will be too late.How badly will a solar storm of this nature hit Earth? The Indian researcher has said that the potential of such a solar storm to wreak havoc on Earth is massive. Jyothi went to the extent of comparing the solar storm to a black swan event in terms of the impact on humanity like the Covid-19 pandemic - in terms of death, destruction of economies and altering forever how people live. In short, it will alter the way we live and is likely to cause many deaths and huge economic losses.Considering the fact that humanity is so dependent on electricity and the Internet to carry out each and every task nowadays, from hospitals to even the daily commute, the destruction potential can be well imagined.

It had a long pointed tail, wings and sharp, outward pointing teeth.The beast's fossil remains were discovered by Osvaldo Rojas, director of the Atacama Desert Museum of Natural History and Culture, and then further investigated by scientists at the University of Chile.Details of the discovery, the first linking such creatures to the Southern Hemisphere, were published in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.""This shows the distribution of the animals in this group was wider than what was known up to now,"" said Jhonatan Alarcon, a University of Chile scientist who led the investigation.The discovery points to close ties and possible migration between the northern and southern hemispheres at a time when most of the globe's southerly land masses where believed to be linked in a supercontinent called Gondwana.”There are pterosaurs of this group also in Cuba, which apparently were coastal animals, so most likely they have migrated between the North and the South or maybe they came once and stayed, we don't know,"" Alarcon said.Chile's vast Atacama Desert, once largely submerged beneath the Pacific Ocean, is now a moonscape of sand and stone.The region, parts of which haven't seen rain for decades, is a hot spot for fossil discoveries, with many remains untouched in remote areas not far beneath the desert surface.

By Wendy Whitman Cobb for The ConversationOn September 15, 2021, the next batch of space tourists are set to lift off aboard a SpaceX rocket. Organised and funded by entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, the Inspiration4 mission touts itself as “the first all-civilian mission to orbit” and represents a new type of space tourism.The four crew members will not be the first space tourists this year. In the past few months, the world witnessed billionaires Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos launching themselves and a lucky few others into space on brief suborbital trips. While there are similarities between those launches and Inspiration4 — the mission is being paid for by one billionaire and is using a rocket built by another, Elon Musk — the differences are noteworthy. From my perspective as a space policy expert, the mission’s emphasis on public involvement and the fact that Inspiration4 will send regular people into orbit for three days make it a milestone in space tourism.Why Inspiration4 is differentThe biggest difference between Inspiration4 and the flights performed earlier this year is the destination.Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic took – and in the future, will take – their passengers on suborbital launches. Their vehicles only go high enough to reach the beginning of space before returning to the ground a few minutes later. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and crew Dragon vehicle, however, are powerful enough to take the Inspiration4 crew all the way into orbit, where they will circle the Earth for three days.The four-person crew is also quite different from the other launches. Led by Isaacman, the mission features a somewhat diverse group of people. One crew member, Sian Proctor, won a contest among people who use Isaacman’s online payment company. Another unique aspect of the mission is that one of its goals is to raise awareness of and funds for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. As such, Isaacman selected Hayley Arceneaux, a physician’s assistant at St. Jude and childhood cancer survivor, to participate in the launch. The final member, Christopher Sembroski, won his seat when his friend was chosen in a charity raffle for St. Jude and offered his seat to Sembroski.Because none of the four participants has any prior formal astronaut training, the flight has been called the first “all civilian” space mission. While the rocket and crew capsule are both fully automated – no one on board will need to control any part of the launch or landing – the four members still needed to go through much more training than the people on the suborbital flights. In less than six months, the crew has undergone hours of simulator training, lessons in flying a jet aircraft and spent time in a centrifuge to prepare them for the G-forces of launch.Social outreach has also been an important aspect of the mission. While Bezos’ and Branson’s flights brought on criticism of billionaire playboys in space, Inspiration4 has tried – with mixed results – to make space tourism more relatable. The crew recently appeared on the cover of Time magazine and is the subject of an ongoing Netflix documentary.There have also been other fundraising events for St. Jude, including a 4-mile virtual run and the planned auction of beer hops that will be flown on the mission.The future of space tourism?Sending a crew of amateur astronauts into orbit is a significant step in the development of space tourism. However, despite the more inclusive feel of the mission, there are still serious barriers to overcome before average people can go to space.For one, the cost remains quite high. Though three of the four are not rich, Isaacman is a billionaire and paid an estimated $200 million to fund the trip. The need to train for a mission like this also means that prospective passengers must be able to devote significant amounts of time to prepare – time that many ordinary people don’t have.Finally, space remains a dangerous place, and there will never be a way to fully remove the danger of launching people – whether untrained civilians or seasoned professional astronauts – into space.Despite these limitations, orbital space tourism is coming. For SpaceX, Inspiration4 is an important proof of concept that they hope will further demonstrate the safety and reliability of their autonomous rocket and capsule systems. Indeed, SpaceX has several tourist missions planned in the next few months, even though the company isn’t focused on space tourism. Some will even includes stops at the International Space Station.Even as space remains out of reach for most on Earth, Inspiration4 is an example of how billionaire space barons’ efforts to include more people on their journeys can give an otherwise exclusive activity a wider public appeal. (The author is Professor of Strategy and Security Studies, US Air Force School of Advanced Air and Space Studies)Follow us on Facebook  | Twitter  | Dailymotion  | YouTube  ",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png

",https://www.gizchina.com/wp-content/uploads/images/2021/09/Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold3.png,"Explained: Why WhatsApp is encrypting backups and how this will impact users - The Indian Express
Facebook-owned messaging platform WhatsApp has introduced  of chats that its users take on cloud services such as Google Drive or Apple’s iCloud. The move is being looked at as a step towards closing a loophole that allowed user chats to be outside the purview of encryption and could therefore be accessed by a third-party, affecting the user’s privacy. WhatsApp said it has been working on bringing this feature out for years and it will be rolled out by the end of this year.What is the need for backups to be end-to-end encrypted?Many users of WhatsApp take backups of their chats, which include text messages, photos, videos and documents shared on the messaging platform. “The content of message chats is valuable to WhatsApp users and WhatsApp offers an in-app backup feature to protect the content in the event a user’s device is lost or stolen; and to enable the transfer of their chat history to a new device,” WhatsApp has noted in a security white-paper on encrypted backups. While WhatsApp’s chat service is end-to-end encrypted, it depended on cloud partners like Google Drive or iCloud to store backups of WhatsApp data. The company had said earlier that once the chats were uploaded to Google Drive or iCloud, they were out of the encryption channel and weren’t private anymore. In several cases, armed with a warrant, law enforcement agencies across the world have been able to gain access to WhatsApp chats through backups stored on these cloud services.What does a user need to do to encrypt the backups of their WhatsApp chats?Once the service is rolled out later this year, users will get an option to turn on encryption for their backups. There will always be an option to not backup the chats to ensure that the chats never go out of WhatsApp’s infrastructure. Once a user decides to encrypt the backup, a 64-digit key will be generated — this key will be necessary for the backup to be restored at a later point in time. Here, the user will have two options — either they can store the 64-digit key themselves for safe keeping or use WhatsApp’s new Hardware Security Module-based Backup Key Vault to store their key with a password they can create. It is essential to note that in case the password, the 64-digit key or the device through which the key was generated is lost before the encrypted chat backup is decrypted, the user will lose access to the backup. The encryption of the backup will happen before it is uploaded to one of the two cloud services and will stay there as an encrypted file that will be accessible only with the use of the 64-digit key. When someone wants to retrieve their backups, they enter their password, which is encrypted and then verified by the Backup Key Vault. Once the password is verified, the Backup Key Vault will send the encryption key back to the WhatsApp client. With the key in hand, the WhatsApp client can then decrypt the backups. Alternatively, if a user has chosen to use the 64-digit key alone, they will have to manually enter the key themselves to decrypt and access their backups.How does this work?In its security white-paper, WhatsApp has compared the system to a safe deposit vault offered by banks, where one key to a vault is provided to the customer to ensure that no one from the bank can alone open the vault without access to the key given to the customer. “With the introduction of end-to-end encrypted backups, WhatsApp has created an HSM (Hardware Security Module) based Backup Key Vault to securely store per-user encryption keys for user backups in tamper-resistant storage, thus ensuring stronger security of users’ message history,” the company said. The HSM-based vault is a digital equivalent of a physical vault, sitting in one of WhatsApp’s servers, containing the key to the encrypted backup. To ensure resilience, WhatsApp said it will deploy this vault in five data centre sites.
A pertinent point to note is that the encryption for backups is being provided only for online cloud services. “Currently, end-to-end encrypted backups are only supported on a user’s primary device In addition, we recommend that users who opt in to end- to-end encrypted backups also deselect WhatsApp from the apps that are included in their device-level backups We will inform users of the need to do this when they set up their end-to-end encrypted backup in WhatsApp,” the company noted.What could be the impact of this feature?In a series of tweets, announcing the new feature, Head of WhatsApp at Facebook Will Cathcart said: “Of course, whenever technologists advance security, some will argue that offering more privacy is bad if it makes it harder for governments to access that information. We believe free societies need the best security to protect people. Billions of people now have sensitive digital information — like their private messages — and that information is at an increasing risk of being stolen by hackers, criminals, and even hostile states themselves”. Governments across the globe, including in India, have been seeking a backdoor into encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp. In the Information Technology Rules announced earlier this year, the Indian government mandated significant social media intermediaries (those with more than 50 lakh users) to trace the originator of a message that is deemed unlawful. The ability to encrypt the backups could elicit a pushback from governments. “…we’re far from a consensus on this. Some governments continue to suggest using their powers to require companies to offer weaker security. We think that’s backwards: we should demand more security from companies for people’s sensitive information, not less,” Cathcart wrote.

Apple‘s hardware event is , which is just a few days away from now. The company is expected to unveil the most-anticipated iPhone 13 series, Watch7 and probably other hardware products at the event. The iPhone 12 successors are expected to bring significant upgrades such as a ProMotion 120Hz display (Pro and Pro Max), improved cameras, and a better chipset — A15. The Watch 7 series renders showed the smartwatch will have an iPhone 12/iPad Pro like square-edge design with a slightly bigger display to fit in more content and more colour options. Here’s everything that Apple is expected to announce at its hardware event.The iPhone 13 is expected to come in four models: iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. They’re said to pack similar display sizes as the iPhone 12. Meaning the upcoming iPhones will have 5.4-inch, 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch sizes. The iPhone 13 series is said to have an improved OLED display, with iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max are said to have a . The standard models will have a 60Hz refresh rate. There are rumours the iPhone 13 lineup may add an always-on display to surface notifications, time and more.The upcoming iPhone 13 series will be powered by the A15 chipset, which should offer significant improvements over the A14 Bionic and should be able to take on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus. The iPhone 13 and 13 mini storage could be bumped to 128GB storage from 64GB. The iPhones are expected to boot iOS 15 out of the box. Not much else is known about the cameras but the iPhone 13 series should bring noticeable improvements, such as a better night mode, among others.iPhone 13 mini is said to pack a 2,406mAh battery, while the standard iPhone 13 could have a 3,095mAh capacity. The iPhone 13 Pro or the 13 Pro Max could have a large 4,352mAh battery. Apple is said to bump up the charging speed from 20W to 25W support this time around but the adapter might not be included in the box. There are speculations the Pro and Pro Max models will get a new 1TB storage option, mmWave 5G in more countries and probably a new colour option.Apple Watch Series 7 will have Apple iPhone 12 and iPad Pro like square-edged design, according to the renders surfaced online. This will be a major redesign for the Apple Watch in recent times. Series 7 will be available in 41mm and 45mm sizes, up from 40mm and 44mm. It isn’t clear what new health features the upcoming smartwatches will gain but rumours suggest the Watch Series 7 is said to bring improvements to existing features like blood oxygen measurement, irregular heart rhythm notifications and others.However, recent reports suggested that Apple is facing production delays due to the new Watch Series 7 design. This means the Cupertino giant might not announce the smartwatch at all or either introduce them officially on the September 14th event and put them for sale at a later date.The September 14th launch is expected to see the unveiling of the iPhone mini and entry-level iPad. This comes after the company had updated the iPad Pro earlier this year with an M1 chipset. The new iPad mini will be powered by the same A15 processor, while the entry-level model is said to ship with an A13 chipset. Both the models are expected to see design improvements such as slim bezels and faster performance. The new iPad mini may not come with a Home button in lieu of Face ID. Though speculations are rife the new iPad will be available later this year, there are no reports suggesting they will be unveiled at Apple’s September 14th event.Lastly, Apple will also announce when the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 updates will be rolled out to everyone. Historically, Apple has always pushed the stable version of its iOS updates days after (or on the same day sometimes) unveiling new iPhones. We can expect the iOS 15 to be available on September 14th or sometime later this month.",https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple_iphone_13_event_what_to_expect.jpg,"Realme 8s 5G vs iQOO Z3 5G vs Realme Narzo 30 Pro 5G: Price in India, Specifications, and Features Compared - MySmartPrice

 WhatsApp is working on a host of new features. The latest feature that WhatsApp is reportedly working on is a voice transcription feature. WhatsApp was earlier toying with the idea of integrating a third-party app for the voice transcription feature. However, as per the latest reports, WhatsApp has taken the matters into its own hands and working on the feature. The feature will reportedly be optional, and it is currently being developed. WhatsApp recently added a new security layer to its messages by offering end-to-end encryption for chat back-ups.As per noted tipster Wabetainfo, WhatsApp is working on a possibility to bring a voice transcription feature to its messaging app. This simply means the app will start transcribing the voice messages when the feature will be rolled out. “We already talked about the possibility to get a transcription of your voice messages four months ago, using a third-party app on WhatsApp for Android. An external app was needed because WhatsApp doesn’t support this feature, but today things are finally changing because we can announce that WhatsApp is working on voice message transcription!” the report said.The WhatsApp features tracker says that your messages won’t be sent to WhatsApp or Facebook server for getting the transcription, but Apple apparently provides a voice transcription feature. “Your voice message will also help Apple to improve its speech recognition technology, but it won’t be directly linked to your identity. This feature is optional but, when you decide to transcribe a message, special permission will be required,” the report said.The report reveals that you would have to grant special permission to the app to transcribe your messages. The screenshot shows that there will be a special transcript section within the app. You can paste your voice recordings and apply the transcript feature. Wabetainfo in its report said that when a message is transcripted for the first time, its transcription is saved locally in the WhatsApp database. So you will not have to transcribe a voice message again and again, as the details will get automatically saved in the database.Wabetainfo says that there is no information on when the feature will be rolled out to the users. On iOS, the feature is under development, so it will be released in a future update for beta testers. There is no information on whether the feature will be rolled out to Android users or not.Click here for IndiaToday.in’s ",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/../sites/all/themes/itg/images/itg_image370x208.jpg

This year, the Khairatabad Ganesh in Hyderabad has received an offering of a massive laddu, weighing 1,100 kg, on the occasion of Vinayaka Chaturthi on Friday, September 10. The offering was made by J Tanay Rana and his family, who run an air cooler business in the city.  On the same day, flagging off the Ganesh festival celebrations, Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan participated in the Ganapati Puja at Khairatabad.
The Khairatabad Ganesh, which stands 40 feet tall this time, has been named as Panchamukha Rudra Maha Ganapati, with the goddess Kaala Nageshwari on the right and goddess Krishna Kaali on the left. Several devotees lined up to pray and give offerings to the idol on Friday. As a part of the ritual, the largest idol gets a huge laddu as prasadam every year. Since 2016, only one family has been offering the laddu to the Khairatabad Ganesh every year. However, with COVID-19, the ritual was halted in 2020, said J Srikanth, a member of the family which offered the massive laddu this year.Srikanth further added that in 2016, they started with a 62 kg laddu, which became 172 kg in 2017, 271 kg in 2018, 751 kg in 2019, and now 1,100 kg in 2021. For the making of this humongous laddu, it took about 48 hours of continuous effort from 8 people. About 200 kg of besan (gram flour), 400 kg of sugar, 140 litres of oil and ghee with additional amounts of elaichi and dry fruits went into its making. It cost about Rs 1 lakh to make this laddu, including the material and labour cost, according to the family.Watch how the humongous laddu for the Khairatabad ganesh was made:

More than 72 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses have been provided to states and union territories so far, the Union Health Ministry said on Saturday. The doses were provided through the government of India (free of cost channel) and through the direct state procurement category, it added.The ministry said over 5.75 crore (5,75,43,795) balance and unutilised COVID-19 vaccine doses are still available with the states and UTs to be administered.The Union government is committed to accelerating the pace and expanding the scope of COVID-19 vaccination throughout the country, it said.The vaccination drive has been ramped up through the availability of more vaccines, advance visibility of vaccine availability to states and UTs for enabling better planning by them, and streamlining the vaccine supply chain, the ministry said.As part of the nationwide vaccination drive, the government has been supporting the states and UTs by providing them COVID-19 vaccines free of cost, it added.COVID-19 VaccineA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
