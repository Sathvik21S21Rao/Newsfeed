Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are one of the most in-form teams in Europe and are still unbeaten in the ongoing 2021-22 season winning 10 out of the 13 matches they have played in all competitions so far.They are also the only Premier League club who have not lost a single game after nine matches in the league. They are second on the league table with 21 points from nine matches, one less than leaders Chelsea.Most recently, Klopp's men thrashed arch-rivals Manchester United 5-0 at the Old Trafford. The humiliating defeat at the hands of their rivals at their own den has sparked a huge outrage among the fans of the club.

Beauty and fashion e-commerce company FSN E-Commerce Ventures which operates Nykaa is launching an IPO with an issue size of over Rs 5,350 crores seeking a valuation of over $7 billion. The issue opens for subscription on October 28, closes on November 1 and is to be listed on November 11. Founder Falguni Nayar spoke to Moneycontrol’s Nisha Poddar on the IPO pitch and growth prospects. Three months back we were expecting around a $4.5 billion valuation. What has changed, to seek over a $7 billion valuation?Nykaa has not had many transactions in the past and, as a result, journalists or anybody who wrote about it conjectured their own valuations. The current valuation has been arrived at after an in-depth process, for which we met more than 20 investors across the globe. You will see names of some of the highest-quality investors in the anchor book, and many of them had detailed conversations with us on our future prospects.In the RHP, you have given Rs 3.5 crore as profit after tax (PAT) and 3.3% as EBITDA margins for Q1FY22, while Nykaa reported Rs 62 crores PAT and 6.6% margins in FY21. So, just taking profit and profitability into account, since that is your USP for commanding high valuations, does the run rate of Q1 make you confident of beating FY21 profits this fiscal? Do seasonality and lumpiness also play a role in your business?There are a number of factors at play. In Q1FY21, we had a much larger loss, of close to Rs 50 crores. In spite of that, we had a full-year profit of Rs 65 crores. So, clearly there is a certain amount of seasonality to our business.Secondly, Q1FY22 was impacted by COVID-19 but despite that we've had strong quarter-on-quarter growth. You can see that, at the consolidated level, the business grew with about $199 million GMV for the first quarter this year. Nykaa has also been acquiring more customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, we’ve added almost one million new customers. The first half of the year ended March 21 was partly impacted by COVID-19. By the second half, we started performing better, but supply-chain constraints were there. So, as we were coming out of the COVID, there was a greater thrust on customer acquisition and building a whole bunch of programmes to engage existing customers more deeply. For any ecommerce company, it's a balance between a returning customer and acquiring a new customer. So, what we have guided is that there is a greater marketing spend in the first quarter and also the second quarter, which will mean more investment towards the future. Secondly, seasonality is there in our business. October to December is the strongest quarter and we build our capacities ahead of that quarter, whether through new app downloads, new customer acquisition or even building our warehouse capacity or our customer service capacity. All of these are built over quarter one and two. Fashion is another vertical for Nykaa, besides the beauty-products business. But, since this space is crowded, what’s your strategy and revenue mix outlook?First and foremost, both for beauty and fashion, we are a multi-brand retailer first. Whatever we do is to build a market and a consumer offering from a multiband retailer perspective, where we are bringing together the best global brands in the country. We distribute them and we support them via marketing, because we have a great customer platform. We grow each of the brands that comes on our platform. So we are not private-label centric.Beauty is an $18-billion market in India. In 2020, fashion was actually $54-billion market space. Beauty had about 8% online penetration while fashion was already at 12%. So, about three years ago, we decided to enter the fashion business but in a differentiated manner where we give more emphasis to premium products and on helping customers discover hidden treasures. I think that strategy is paying off. We have been able to hugely scale up in our fashion business, which now accounts for a substantial percentage of our GMV. We do believe that in fashion we will not be a dominant player. This is a very, very large market and there are just a couple of players… just in single digit numbers. The market is big enough for all players, with customers in different age groups and looking for different price segments from different parts of the country.  Looking at your numbers it’s evident that marketing and advertising spend is big. When that increases, your profits take a hit and, when that is lower, the profitability improves. How will the mix look, when it is incremental growth in profit and profitability versus market share expansion? For all internet companies, marketing or customer acquisition is the biggest cost. But the beauty is that a lot of our business comes from the past customers acquired, who come back and buy again and we call them returning customer cohorts, and Nykaa has a good track record with that. That reflects in our mix of new and repeat customers, 30% new and 70% repeat. ",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"21st Cen Mgt Consolidated September 2021 Net Sales at Rs 192.55 crore, up 300960% Y-o-Y - Moneycontrol.com

""We are committed to bringing this long-term vision to life and we expect to increase our investments for the next several years.""Facebook's earnings comes amid one of the most difficult periods in the company's history as a trove of internal documents leaked by a Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen detail the social giant's various missteps and struggle in moderating content, especially in multilingual countries like India, its biggest market with over 340 million users.During the earnings conference call, Zuckerberg termed it as a ""coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company""He said when they make these decisions, they need to balance ""competing social equities"" like free expression with reducing harmful content, or enabling strong encrypted privacy with supporting law enforcement, or enabling research and interoperability with locking down data as much as possible.""It makes a good soundbite to say that we don't solve these impossible tradeoffs because we're just focused on making money, but the reality is these questions are not primarily about our business, but about balancing different difficult social values"" Zuckerberg said.New Financial StructureIn an indication of how important the metaverse unit is becoming within Facebook, the firm is also recasting its financial reporting structure to break out Facebook Reality Labs as a separate reporting segment in its earnings reports from Q4 2021.""I recognise the magnitude of this bet on the future, and I am grateful for the support of our investors, the creative community, and the thousands of talented people working on this effort inside our company to bring this inspiring future to life,"" Zuckerberg said.He said that for the next few years, Facebook will focus on putting ""more of the foundational pieces into place"", an investment that is not going to be profitable for the company in the near future, but likely to mature over the next few years.""If we do a good job on this, and I would say later in this decade, is when we would, sort of, expect this to be more of a real business story,"" Zuckerberg said.He added that ""helping to shape the next platform"" would further reduce the company's dependence on delivering its services through its rivals. Apple is one such company which has had a significant impact on the company's advertising business in recent quarters through its new ad-tracking changes in the latest iOS update.Facebook also warned of significant uncertainty in Q4 due to ""continued headwinds from Apple's iOS 14 changes"".""We believe that the metaverse is going to be the successor of the mobile internet,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We think it's going to unlock a massively larger creative economy of both digital and physical goods than what exists today.""Zuckerberg is expected to share more details on the company's vision for the metaverse, apart from new at its annual Connect conference later this week.

"Study finds 'robust' evidence that COVID-19 is seasonal infection - Deccan Chronicle
London: COVID-19 may be a seasonal infection linked to low temperatures and humidity, much like seasonal influenza, according to new ""robust"" evidence found by researchers.The study, recently published in the journal Nature Computational Science, also supports the considerable contribution of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the need to shift to measures that promote ""air hygiene."" A research team led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), Spain, noted that a key question regarding SARS-CoV-2 is whether it is behaving, or will behave, as a seasonal virus like influenza, or whether it will be equally transmitted during any time of the year.A first theoretical modelling study suggested that climate was not a driver in COVID-19 transmission, given the high number of susceptible individuals with no immunity to the virus.However, some observations suggested that the initial propagation of COVID-19 in China occurred in a latitude between 30 and 50 degrees N, with low humidity levels and low temperatures between 5 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius. ""The question of whether COVID-19 is a genuine seasonal disease becomes increasingly central, with implications for determining effective intervention measures,"" said Xavier Rodo, director of the Climate and Health programme at ISGlobal and coordinator of the study.The researchers first analysed the association of temperature and humidity in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 spread in 162 countries across five continents, before changes in human behaviour and public health policies were put into place.The results show a negative relationship between the transmission rate (R0) and both temperature and humidity at the global scale, the researchers said. Higher transmission rates were associated with lower temperatures and humidity, they said.The researchers then analysed how this association between climate and disease evolved over time, and whether it was consistent at different geographical scales.They used a statistical method that was specifically developed to identify similar patterns of variation at different windows of time.The team found a strong negative association for short time windows between the number of cases and temperature and humidity.The patterns were consistent during the first, second and third waves of the pandemic at different spatial scales: worldwide, countries, down to individual regions within highly affected countries and even to the city level. The first epidemic waves waned as temperature and humidity rose, and the second wave rose as temperatures and humidity fell, according to the researchers.However, this pattern was broken during summertime in all continents, they said.""This could be explained by several factors, including mass gatherings of young people, tourism, and air conditioning, among others, said Alejandro Fontal, researcher at ISGlobal and first author of the study.When adapting the model to analyse transient correlations at all scales in countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where the virus arrived later, the same negative correlation was observed. The climate effects were most evident at temperatures between 12 degrees and 18 degrees Celsius and humidity levels between 4 and 12 grammes per cubic metre (g/m3).However, the study authors warned that these ranges are still indicative, given the short records available.Using an epidemiological model, the researcher showed that incorporating temperature into the transmission rate works better for predicting the rise and fall of the different waves, particularly the first and third ones in Europe.""Altogether, our findings support the view of COVID-19 as a true seasonal low-temperature infection, similar to influenza and to the more benign circulating coronaviruses,"" Rodo said. This seasonality could contribute importantly to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since low humidity conditions have been shown to reduce the size of aerosols, and thereby increase airborne transmission of seasonal viruses such as influenza.""This link warrants an emphasis on 'air hygiene' through improved indoor ventilation as aerosols are capable to persist suspended for longer times,"" said Rodo.The study highlights the need to include meteorological parameters in the evaluation and planning of control measures.

'In AFib, electrical impulses (which dictate the heart rhythm) are fast and chaotic, leading to irregular heartbeats and making it less effective in pumping blood,' explained doctors from AIG HospitalHYDERABAD: In an unique, minimal invasive treatment for patients with Atrial Fibrillation, AIG Hospitals, Hyderabad, performed the novel Cryoballoon Ablation procedure on two patients, making it the first hospital to do so in south India.“Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is a common heart rhythm disorder affecting more than 50 lakh Indians, which increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. In AFib, electrical impulses (which dictate the heart rhythm) are fast and chaotic, leading to irregular heartbeats and making it less effective in pumping blood,” explained doctors from AIG Hospitals.Patients with AFib complain of palpitations, weakness and shortness of breath and usually, if medicines do not help, they are required to go for radiofrequency ablation procedure to stop the malfunctioning electrical signals using radiofrequency energy. “This new technique, Cryoballoon Ablation, uses freezing (cryo) to deactivate the abnormal heart tissue causing the irregular heartbeats. This was chosen over Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) because it yields more effective results, and in that case, the reoccurrence of AFib is significantly less. The procedure time is also less as compared to RFA. All these lead to a better quality of life for our patients,” said Dr C Narasimhan, Director & HOD, Electrophysiology, AIG Hospitals.Meanwhile, post the first set of procedures done in the hospital, the two patients were discharged in a day and were able to resume their normal physical activities soon after. “This is an encouraging start for us as we have managed to treat AFib using this technique, which is much safer. Furthermore, we are coming up with a dedicated AFib clinic to identify and help these patients under a comprehensive programme involving specialists from cardiology, electrophysiology, cardiac surgery and imaging, and arrhythmia research,” he added.O

"Antim Trailer Launch: Salman Khan reveals how Mahesh Manjrekar continued to shoot despite cancer diagnosis - Bollywood Hungama
SEARCHLANGUAGEFOLLOW US ONFEEDBACKThe makers of Antim: The Final Truth released a trailer from the film  on October 25 in presence of Salman Khan, Aayush Sharma and director-actor Mahesh Manjrekar. The trailer released today is a bigger peek into the 'Antim world'. The trailer comes loaded with pumping action, high-octane background music, and much more. During the filming, Manjrekar was diagnosed with cancer. Salman Khan praised the director's work that it was the passion for films that drove him to work even in tough times.At the trailer launch on Monday, Salman said, ""He didn't tell us before. As soon as he finished a part of the shoot he got himself operated.""Mahesh said, ""I have lost 35 kilos. It was during the shooting of the last portions of Antim that I was diagnosed with cancer. But today I am cancer free. I was lucky that the chemotherapy didn't affect me. I was going through chemotherapy through the shoot. Later I underwent surgery. It is my passion towards work that drove me. When I got to know I have cancer, it didn't shock me. I know there are so many people who have cancer and they fight and survive.""“I didn’t want to act in ‘Antim’ but Salman forced me to do it. I prefer not to act in a film that I direct. Because you always feel you can’t see yourself right. You don’t know what you’ve done. But then, the role was a beautiful cameo so I did it,” the director added.Talking about working with Salman Khan, he said, “As a director, I’ve known Salman for so many years, we have done so many films as co-stars, too. Beyond films, I treat him more like a brother than a friend because I am always at his house. I am well aware of his capabilities as well. Directing him has never been difficult at all. In fact, this time it was much easier because I knew exactly what I wanted from him. The only thing I wanted was for Salman to say the lines and mean the lines. Many a times, people enact their lines. I told him to believe in the lines and then say those dialogues. People tend to scream and shout their lines. With Salman, I didn’t face any such difficulty because I know him and he knows me. I wasn’t scared of him either. That helped a lot. I really loved working with Aayush, too. He is one hell of a director’s actor.”Starring Salman Khan, Aayush Sharma and Mahima Makwana, Antim: The Final Truth is directed by Mahesh Manjrekar, produced by Salma Khan and is presented by Salman Khan Films.

"NASA's SpaceX Crew 3 members to arrive at Kennedy Space Centre ahead of launch to ISS - Republic World
The next crew of astronauts, SpaceX Crew-3, to go to the International Space Station is scheduled to arrive at the Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday, October 26, ahead of the launch this weekend. The NASA SpaceX Crew-3 mission is scheduled to launch from Launch Complex 39A at 2:21 am on Sunday, October 31 in a Crew Dragon spacecraft on SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. The launch, which had been set for Saturday, has been postponed to allow for extra ""spacecraft processing.""NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Tom Marshburn, and Kyala Barron, as well as European Space Agency astronaut Mathias Maurer, are slated to dock with the International Space Station early Monday, November 1, about 22 hours after the Crew-3 launch date, according to NASA. Four astronauts will spend six months on the International Space Station. Chari, Barron, and Maurer will be making their debut spaceflights on this mission, while Marshburn will be doing his third.According to NASA, astronauts will embark on a long-duration science mission onboard the orbiting laboratory, living and working as part of what is planned to be a seven-member crew. Astronauts would have some overlap with the Crew-2 mission. NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, and European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet are scheduled to return to Earth between early and mid-November, according to the space agency. The Crew Dragon spacecraft will make its fifth crew launch, although for NASA, it'll will be the fourth.The SpaceX rocket will transport a crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) for this mission, which will be led by Indian-American astronaut Raja Chari. In an announcement, NASA stated that this new date of launch is to allow them additional time for spacecraft processing.Moreover, if the mission needs more time, NASA has also planned on a backup launch time and date which is 10.40 am on November 3. Currently, the crew members comprising of NASA astronauts Raja Chari, mission commander, Tom Marshburn, pilot, and Kayla Barron, mission specialist, along with European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer, are under a quarantine period that started on October 16.SpaceX has improved the Dragon spacecraft to safeguard the communications system from radiation and to allow for flawless docking mechanisms and procedures once it reaches the ISS. Following the launch of the Inspiration4 spacecraft, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk promised a better waste management system, and the Endurance spaceship now features a better bathroom system. The Crew-3 mission will carry the third crew to fly a full-duration mission to the space station on Dragon for a six-month stay on the orbiting laboratory, with the goal of returning Crew-2 personnel to Earth.",https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xhdpi/eh5rnmiljakeleek_1635218890.jpeg,"Trigonopterus corona: A beetle species named after coronavirus - The Indian Express
On the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, museum scientists have discovered 28 new species of beetles.

In April, a new species of caddisfly (a moth-like insect) was collected near a stream in Kosovo by a team of scientists, and named Potamophylax coronavirus (Biodiversity Data Journal).The same month, out of six new species of Brazilian wasps described in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, one was named Allorhagas quarentenus, a reference to the quarantine, which occurred while the authors were describing the species.And earlier this month, out of five new wasp species discovered in Mexico, scientists named one Stethantyx covida (Zookeys).Newsletter | ",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/10/corona.jpg,"What The Giant James Webb Telescope Will See That Hubble Can't - Mashable India
Astronomers like Christine Chen are thrilled about the looming launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.The $10 billion instrument,  and replete with gold-coated mirrors, will orbit 1 million miles from Earth and peer into places humanity hasn't seen before. This includes some of the first stars ever born, the most distant galaxies, and curious planets in the cosmos. ""It's really cool,"" marveled Chen, an astronomer at the , an organization that will run the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST. The instrument's deeply-anticipated launch is currently set for Dec. 18, 2021, though in recent months the telescope has often been in the news for reasons unrelated to its scientific endeavors. , NASA's leader in the 1960s who oversaw the agency during a time when the federal government  from NASA and other departments. It was a shameful time in American history called the ""Lavender Scare."" For now, NASA said it will keep the JWST label after finding no evidence about Webb that ""warrants changing the name."" Here's what JWST, and ultimately you, will see that Hubble can't.Telescopes with bigger mirrors can see fainter objects. That's because larger mirrors capture more light. Imagine particles of light as ping pong balls, and a telescope's mirrors as a bucket. Hubble's mirror is around eight feet in diameter, while JWST's mirror is much larger, at over 21 feet in diameter.""You're going to collect more ping pong balls,"" explained Jean Creighton, an astronomer and the director of the Manfred Olson Planetarium at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee.Capturing more light is critical for observing the earliest stars and galaxies that formed in the universe, over 13 billion years ago. The , meaning it's constantly grown or stretched since its violent inception (the ""Big Bang""), so the light from these ancient parts of the cosmos is very, very, very far away (billions of light-years). The most far-off light left stars billions of years ago, so observing this light is like peering into the deep, deep past. ""We're looking back in time,"" said Chen. (Even when we look at our own star — with protection — we're also peering into the past; it takes over eight minutes for sunlight to reach Earth.) ""We're looking back in time.""And we'll see unprecedented things.""We're going to see the very first stars and galaxies that ever formed,"" said Creighton. ""We have not been able to do this with Hubble.""Hubble can see faint light that's some 12.7 billion years old, meaning light that existed 1 billion years after the Big Bang. If all goes as planned, JWST will see light that's nearly 13.7 billion years old, when the earliest stars and planets started to form.Hubble largely views light that humans can see (aka ""visible light""). But there are many types of light that our eyes can't see. JWST is specialized to observe one of these, called ""infrared,"" which allows astronomers to see vastly more stars and planets.How so?The universe is filled with thick, smoke-like clouds of dust and gas. ""That obscures things,"" explained Jason Steffen, an assistant professor of physics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who researches planets outside our solar system (aka exoplanets). ""It lifts the veil.""But infrared light can slip through thick clouds of dust. Infrared has longer wavelengths than visible light, so the light waves don't get scattered as much (and obscured) by particles in the universe. Longer wavelengths, whose peaks and valleys are spread far apart, are less likely to collide with particles in space. The image comparison below, taken by Hubble, shows how infrared light slips through cosmic dust. That's the Carina Nebula, a dazzling cloud of dust and gas. Hubble's infrared view reveals the many stars hidden behind the dust. ""It lifts the veil,"" said Creighton.What's more, viewing extremely distant galaxies and stars is made much easier (or at times possible) by seeing them in infrared light. As described earlier, , and the light traveling through the cosmos stretches, too. ""If you're looking at a distant galaxy, that light has been stretched out,"" explained Steffen. The light's wavelengths become longer. That's a problem. ""This can make distant objects very dim (or invisible) at visible wavelengths of light, because that light reaches us as infrared light,"" writes NASA. But JWST's infrared views make the invisible visible.There are few things in the universe more enthralling than exoplanets. Why, some of these known planets, like ""super-Earths"" some two to 10 times the size of our planet, might contain habitable, rocky environments, or even water. JWST will spend a significant amount of time viewing exoplanets in other star systems. (To JWST, these planets will appear as dots, not grandiose, colorful planets.)Already, NASA has confirmed . But with JWST's ability to peer through clouds of dust, the astronomer Chen expects to find considerably more.Crucially, JWST won't simply sleuth out the existence of exoplanets. It will analyze their atmospheres. The telescope  that can reveal what particles are composed of, based on how light reacts with them. (Light passing through water vapor or oxygen, for example, behaves in certain, well-known ways.)Even a  can be considerably more useful to astronomers than a brilliant picture. ""There's a whole lot of information,"" explained Creighton.""It gives much more information than the pretty picture does.""Of particular interest to scientists are , some 40 light-years (235 trillion miles) from Earth. Perhaps JWST will discover a rocky planet that has hints of potential life in its atmosphere, like the oxygen algae and plants breathe into our air.Before any of this cosmic science begins, however, JWST has a great, if not daunting, journey ahead. After a nail-biting launch (the robotic cargo is unusually precious), JWST must make the 1 million-mile journey through space. Its tightly packed hexagonal mirrors must unfold properly, and its  must unfurl as planned. And unlike with Hubble, astronauts can't launch into space and fix any potential problems with the extremely distant telescope. The launch looms large in the astronomical world.

Previous Starship prototypes have performed high-altitude flight tests from SpaceX’s Starbase facility in Boca Chica, Texas, but the next stage of development requires a massive Super Heavy rocket in order to propel it to orbit.   The November test will see Starship SN20 launch from Starbase before separating from the booster rocket and touching down 90 minutes later off the coast of Hawaii.SpaceX will attempt to catch the Super Heavy rocket using “robot chopsticks” attached to the launch tower – named ‘Mechazilla’ by Mr Musk – that will guide it back down onto the pad.  They will provide thrust for Starship’s upper stage when there is negligible atmospheric pressure.The Raptor Vacuum engines are a variation of the Raptor engines used in previous tests, featuring a much larger nozzle compared to their seal-level counterparts.  SpaceX shared a video on Sunday showing the latest progress of its Starship craft, titled ‘Gateway to Mars’. It included clips of the main Starship craft being attached to the Super Heavy booster rocket, measuring 120m (400ft) when connected together.Orbital flights require a launch license from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the authority previously proving a hindrance to launches of previous Starship prototypes.  “If all goes well, Starship will be ready for its first orbital launch attempt next month, pending regulatory approval,” Mr Musk announced on Friday.SpaceX signed a multi-billion dollar deal with Nasa earlier this year to build Starship rockets for the US space agency’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon in 2024.   The two rocket stages are capable of delivering roughly 100,000kg to low Earth orbit, according to SpaceX’s calculations, while producing around 70 meganewtons of thrust off the pad – approximately double that of the famous Saturn V rockets used to launch humans to the Moon during Nasa’s Apollo missions. Eventually, the craft could carry up to 100 people on missions to Mars and beyond, with SpaceX planning to build up to 100 new Starship rockets every year.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png

Apple announced the AirPods 3 alongside the new MacBook Pro variants last week and added another audio product to its audio portfolio. The new AirPods third generation bring a slightly new design to the wireless earbuds along with some new features, bringing its price closer to the AirPods Pro than ever before.So if you’re out looking for a new pair of AirPods to buy, which one exactly should be your pick? Here’s a head-to-head between all the AirPods variants available in India right now to help you figure out which one is for you. We will not be including the first-gen AirPods because Apple no longer sells them via its website.The AirPods 3 are priced at Rs 18,500 in India, making them more expensive by the AirPods second generation by quite a bit. However, that is still Rs 6,400 less than the price of the AirPods Pro which come in at Rs 24,900 in India. The older AirPods 2 are priced at Rs 12,900.The AirPods 2 come in a more elongated case shape and the earbuds themselves have plastic heads and no silicone tips, along with longer stems. With the AirPods 3 you still have a plastic head, but with shorter stems and more squarish case. The AirPods Pro come with a squarish case too but feature silicone tips on the earbuds.The AirPods 2 weigh at 4 grams per earbud and 38.2 grams for the case. The AirPods 3 weigh at 4.28 grams per earbud and 37.91 grams for the case. The AirPods Pro weigh at 5.4 grams per earbud and 45.6 grams for the case.The AirPods 2 misses out on key features including Spatial Audio, sweat and water resistance and MagSafe charging support. Both the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro come with these features. The AirPods Pro also packs Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a transparency mode.The AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro also support for Adaptive EQ, something that the AirPods 2 misses out on. The AirPods Pro features a vent system for pressure equalisation in your ear inside the silicone tips, something not present on (or applicable to) the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3.The AirPods Pro and AirPods 3 also feature a broader range of gesture controls on the earbuds that let you control music playback and calls and trigger Siri compared to the AirPods 2, which has minimal gesture support.The AirPods 2 feature up to 5 hours of listening time with a single charge of the earbuds and up to 3 hours for calls. The case gives you a total battery life of about 24 hours and 15 minutes of in-case charging will get you 3 hours of music time and 2 hours of talk time.Coming to the AirPods 3, you get up to 6 hours of music time and 4 hours for calls with a single charge of the earbuds. However, the 6 hours figure can come down to 5 hours if you have Spatial Audio turned on. The case will give you a total battery life of about 30 hours and 5 mins of charging in the case will get you 1 hour of battery life on the buds.With the AirPods Pro, you get 5 hours of music time (4.5 hours with ANC turned on) and 3.5 hours of call time. The case gives you a total battery life of about 24 hours and 5 mins of charging in the case will get you 1 hour of battery life on the buds.If you’re looking to buy the most affordable pair of AirPods, the AirPods 2 is your best bet. It should suit most college-goers and basic users who may use it for music and calls and may not need the absolute best call quality and feature support.Meanwhile, the AirPods 3 provides a good balance between pricing and feature, adding support for Spatial Audio, MagSafe and sweat and water resistance, making them ideal for outdoor activities like running in addition to other use cases. They also feature the best battery life between the three products.The AirPods Pro are still the best sounding truly wireless earbuds Apple makes, but they are more expensive and have slightly lesser battery life. However, if ANC support and the silicone-tipped design are important factors to you, you will have to go with the AirPods Pro.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/10/AirPods-2-vs-AirPods-3-vs-AirPods-Pro.jpg,"Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is already receiving the November security update - GSMArena.com news - GSMArena.com

What just happened? A recent Windows 10 update is pushing Microsoft's PC Health Check app to all Windows 10 systems. Even though it started as a compatibility tool for Windows 11, the latest update notes say users can now use the software more generally to check the status of a PC. Windows update KB5005463 brings the PC Health Check app (formerly the Windows 11 Compatibility Tool) to all Windows 10 systems running version 2004 and later. Even though Microsoft says it it now serves a more general purpose, the app is not coming to Windows 11 systems.Although checking Windows 11 eligibility is still one of the app's functions, it now also presents a single page aggregating a collection of other features that might make them easier to reach. Somewhat like the ""About"" page in System Settings, PC Health Check presents some basic information about a PC like its name, system RAM, the capacity of its primary storage drive, and its age (it's unclear how it calculates age).The app provides another access point from which users can backup and sync OneDrive folders. It's also another way to check the Windows Update status and what specific version of Windows 10 a system is currently running. According to the update notes, the PC Health Check app can ""view the battery capacity relative to the original for devices that use a single or multiple batteries,"" in what sounds like a battery health check. Though it can view a device's remaining storage capacity, it seems only to check the main OS drive.The update notes say this is part of the automatic Windows 10 update, but you can manually download the PC Health Check app from our download archive or the bottom of Microsoft's Windows 11 page.",https://static.techspot.com/images2/news/bigimage/2021/09/2021-09-07-image-34.jpg

The reality is that no such dangers exist there at present,"" the Chief Minister said.The Tamil Nadu government is cooperating with Kerala in a good manner on all issues, the CM said, adding that there were some areas where the two states have minor differences and these needed resolution through discussions.
