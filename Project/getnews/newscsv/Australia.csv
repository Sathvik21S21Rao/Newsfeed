"'Vulnerable' teen finalists given major US Open 'warning' - Yahoo Sport Australia
Teen tennis sensations Emma Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez may be riding a wave of euphoria, but the US Open women's finalists have been given a stern warning about their newfound status as global stars.British 18-year-old Raducanu and Canada's 19-year-old phenom Fernandez have become the toast of the tennis world on the back of their improbable march to the Flushing Meadows final.'INCREDIBLE': 'WOW': 'ABSURD': The teenage prodigies have set the sport alight with their fearless play and youthful exuberance, and regardless of a win or loss in Sunday morning's (AEST) final, both of their lives will never be the same again.With their incredible rise to fame off the back of a stunning run of form, comes a whole new level of pressure and public scrutiny that some can find suffocating.""Everyone is going to want them, every tournament is going to want them to play,"" said Ashley Keber, the WTA Tour's vice-president of member relations, who leads a team that develops programs and resources for players and their teams.Virtual unknowns when the year began, Raducanu and Fernandez are anonymous faces no more to New York crowds chanting their names and celebrities offering praise on social media.Following her semi-final win over Maria Sakkari on Thursday, Raducanu was asked by a reporter how it felt to be the most famous person in Britain.A lot to digest for a tennis-loving schoolgirl who sat her A-levels, high school-leaving exams, in June.From royalty to the prime ministers of Canada and Britain to sports stars and the famous, the world has taken notice and so has the WTA.While the WTA has programs in place to help players cope with the demands of the sport, Keber acknowledged Raducanu and Fernandez will require a little more diligence.You don't need to look hard to find cautionary tales.Fernandez and Raducanu have exuded an invincible aura, but so did Naomi Osaka.As a 20-year-old, Osaka was anointed tennis's next big thing in 2018, winning the first of her four Grand Slam titles in the very same Arthur Ashe Stadium.The three years since have been challenging for Osaka, who has struggled to deal with the crushing expectations, putting the focus on athletes' mental health.Beaten in the third round by Fernandez last week, the distraught defending champion left Flushing Meadows saying she did not know when she would play again.""We have seen this before and that's where we draw our knowledge from and try to get ahead of some of these items,"" said Keber. ""We can't predict on an individual level but we have seen some of the warning signs overall.""Let's be honest, these are tough times, people are growing, they are going to make mistakes.""It doesn't mean it is going to be perfect or a smooth path but how can we make it as smooth as possible.""When the US Open ends for both teenage stars they will step out of their grand slam dream into the cold reality of the day-to-day grind, weighted down by expectations and obligations that were not part of their lives two weeks ago.Protecting those assets from added stress will be a priority for a women's game looking for new engaging identities as the careers of Serena and Venus Williams draw closer to an end.""This will be a vulnerable time for them win-or-lose and it is not just the next couple of days. It will be many months, and I think this is where their teams can reach out to us.""Their time in New York has been unencumbered by the burden of expectations and the pressure that comes with them.""Now there is no pressure on her (Fernandez) at all,"" said second seed Aryna Sabalenka after being knocked out in the semi-finals by the 73rd-ranked Canadian. ""Crowds are here for her. You're kind of feeling this crush and you're using it, hitting the ball, not really thinking, everything is going in.""This is nice kind of feeling. I felt it before.""But the question is when you will start to understand what's going on and where you are, how good can you deal with all these expectations and all this level, all this pressure.""with AAP",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tqwjHuWCt0sgQ3QiP5q0lg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d8822c0-12bd-11ec-afd7-0c68cdb44662,"Daniil Medvedev rolls into US Open final with straight-sets win over Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime - ABC News

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Wests Tigers are considering throwing a lifeline to Adam Elliott as the club prepares to make a call on embattled coach Michael Maguire in coming days.The futures of Maguire and Elliott, both at a career crossroads for very different reasons, will become clearer this week. Elliott made a clean break with Canterbury, who were considering ripping up his contract with two years still remaining after his latest misdemeanour.Instead, the parties came to an amicable parting, which will result in the backrower being paid his dues for the rest of the current financial league year and about $100,000 over the next two seasons. In return, the 26 year old will waive his right to take legal action against the Bulldogs.However, the Tigers are in a holding pattern on the retention and recruitment front until Maguire’s future is resolved. The Kiwis mentor has two years remaining on his contract after a 13th placed finish, the low point coming in a 38-0 loss to the Bulldogs last weekend.While there has been widespread speculation that Maguire is facing the axe, Tigers powerbrokers are mindful of the costs of paying him out and replacing him at a time when there isn’t a standout candidate for the position.Adam Elliott is searching for a club after parting ways with the Bulldogs on Friday.Credit:NRL Photos and those with knowledge of the situation have indicated he is now a strong chance of retaining his position.Asked is sacking Maguire improves the club’s situation, Bulldogs supremo Phil Gould told the ‘Six Tackles with Gus’ podcast: “I don’t think so.“I know Michael Maguire, I know how hard he works and how passionate he is about the job. Do I think their performances reflect his coaching ability? No, I don’t.“We tend to point the finger at the coach rather than the players. I think their roster management has needed to be a lot better than it’s been.“That started many years ago, Michael Maguire inherited an unenviable situation when he first went there …“It all sours with what happened on the weekend, they got beaten 38-0 by the team running last. They did have a number of NRL players out … whilst it was a dismal performance, it’s not a reflection of the strength of their club at the moment.“So it’s heightened all the talk around it.“The pressure has built on the club and the coach.”Tigers chairman Lee Hagipantelis defended the club’s decision to extend Maguire’s tenure last December and said a decision on his future will be made once a club review is completed this week.“My dealings with Michael Maguire and [Tigers CEO] Justin Pascoe … there’s never any indication they are going to change the coach,” Gould said.“Even after the game on the weekend, I basically just checked in with Michael and Justin because it was a bad result for them. I didn’t sense any indication they were going to break ranks and change that.“I’m not sensing they are looking for a change of coach, but sometimes media pressure can sometimes put pressure on people in the organisation to say ‘Hang on, maybe we need to rethink’.“If their intention all along was to keep Michael Maguire, they really need to hold their ranks and march through this.”",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.536%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_443%2C$y_123/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/65d5d5336c4cc0dfb54834e683c0590a6e57c985

It’s not often you actually know that you’re watching a business school case study unfold before your eyes. While it may not have been completely clear until after the fact that , there’s no doubt that the world’s oil and gas industry is heading towards an existential moment that is somewhere between 10 and 20 years away.The urgency created by this reality is driving a wave of consolidation across the energy sector, including the merger of Santos and Oil Search,  following an extra week of due diligence.Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher has sealed his $21 billion deal.     David RoweThere are no major changes to the terms of the deal – Santos investors will still control 61.5 per cent of the merged entity and Oil Search investors 38.5 per cent – but there is some more detail around the synergies that will be extracted, with the two parties flagging annual savings of between $US90 million and $US110 million ($122 million and $149 million).The bringing together of two mid-sized energy groups is typical of the three types of deals we can expect to see in the sector, according to Accenture Australia’s energy industry lead, John Pascoe.He says mergers of mid-sized groups are designed to help create the sort of scale that will be needed to navigate a world where financing new projects and growth is going to become more difficult as environmental, social and governance concerns continue to rise. The Santos-Oil Search deal is instructive; .A second (but not unrelated) group of merger candidates, Pascoe says, will come from larger groups that need to find ways to quickly increase their oil and gas reserves, either to get growth or backfill existing projects. The  is an example of this trend, Pascoe says.Again, this is about scale and ESG concerns. If getting projects up in the next decade is going to be harder for energy companies, maybe it’s better to go out and acquire existing ones.The final group of deals Pascoe sees is arguably the most interesting: private equity driven M&A. The well-established argument here is that private equity investors, without some pressures of public markets, can opportunistically pick up oil and gas assets that will have short but profitable lives, and make big returns over the next decade.This sector has been attractive to PE in the past, particularly in the US. According to Fitch, more than $US150 billion was invested in fossil fuel assets over a 10-year period, compared to about $US40 billion in solar and wind between 2010 and 2020.But the winds of ESG change are also sweeping through private equity. Will this make private equity more hesitant? Or will a certain type of private equity – cash from family offices not worried by a potential reputational hit, for example – be willing to grab bargain-basement assets that offer good medium-term returns?Another question is how energy’s biggest players balance the need to keep running their existing assets with the potential need to transform themselves into a different type of business.The merger rationale for the Santos-Oil Search merger, for example, is mainly focused on the development of the group’s current crop of gas assets. Gas is likely to have a long future as a firming technology, but may the merged group eventually push into another clean power source to cement its future? If so, what does that look like? What deals will be involved?The role of government and regulators is fascinating here too. Pascoe points out that typical competition concerns around oil and gas deals may need to take a back seat to more practical considerations.For example, it may be better to see bigger deals that form larger, more robust companies with the financial wherewithal to remediate projects that have reached the end of their useful lives, and not just abandon them, leaving behind an environmental mess.Could governments eventually emerge as the fourth driver of energy deals for assets no one wants to own, but society still needs?It sounds far-fetched in an Australian context, but one veteran banker in the sector, who has been stunned by the ESG-led shift against oil and gas in markets – “It took 15 years for investors to go sour on coal. It took 15 months for them to go sour on oil” – points out that governments own 70 per cent of oil and gas assets around the world.The next chapters of this case study will be absolutely fascinating. And, as Pascoe says, not every firm is going to make it.Fetching latest articles",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"Sight unseen property sales on the rise amid inspection ban - The Age
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, In an ideal world, Nikki would have inspected her dream home before purchasing it.But with a ban on private inspections during lockdown, the 27-year-old knew she’d miss out on the four-bedroom Fitzroy North house if she didn’t buy it sight unseen.“If you had asked me three years ago, there’s no way I would’ve bought a property without seeing it,” said Nikki, who does not want to disclose her surname or the price she paid for her new home.Nikki recently purchased a four bedroom house in Fitzroy North but was unable to inspect it in person due to Melbourne’s lockdown restrictions. Credit:Wayne TaylorMany buyers are in a similar situation, with real estate agents reporting an increasing number of sight unseen property sales during Melbourne’s sixth lockdown.It comes as property prices continue to soar, David Gigliotti, a sales manager at Moonee Valley Real Estate has sold 14 properties sight unseen during Melbourne’s latest lockdown.This week he sold a three-bedroom house in Keilor East that faced a railway and factory for $975,000, more than $140,000 above its reserve. The property sold a week after it was listed and just four hours after the contract was emailed to 27 prospective buyers.“There was no time for lawyers to look over the contract,” Mr Gigliotti said.Mr Gigliotti said prospective homeowners were weighing up the risks of buying a property sight unseen with the risk of more intense competition when restrictions ease and private inspections resume. “The fear of missing out is the biggest driving force,” he said.Belle Property St Kilda director Sam Inan said savvy buyers had learnt the lessons of previous lockdowns.“The aftermath is similar to a shaking of a soft drink can,” he explained.“The market tends to come back with vigour. They know they will pay more after lockdown so why not pay now with minimal competition?”This week Mr Inan sold an unrenovated three-bedroom Caulfield house for more than $2.6 million five days after it was listed. It was advertised with a price range of $2.3 million to $2.5 million and received offers from five people who had never set foot in the property. The vendors took their own photos as professional photographers were banned from entering the premises.He also recently sold a sight unseen three-bedroom Californian bungalow in Elwood for $1.97 million, almost $300,000 above the top of its estimated price range.As weary Melburnians emerged from last year’s 1But Domain’s chief of research and economics Nicola Powell suspects the post-lockdown price rise won’t be as significant this time due to the “psychological hurdle” of Melbourne’s median house price now sitting above $1 million.“Affordability will start to restrain buyer budgets which will have an impact on the pace of price growth in Melbourne,” Dr Powell said.Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has pledged that private inspections of unoccupied properties will go ahead once 70 per cent of Victorians have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a milestone estimated to occur on September 23.But that’s too little, too late, according to the Real Estate Institute of Victoria and Real Estate Buyers Agents Association of Australia.The peak bodies have been lobbying the state government to immediately allow one-on-one property inspections, arguing they are an essential service for renters, homeowners and prospective buyers. They point out that private inspections have been allowed to continue in every other Australian jurisdiction, except the ACT, during lockdowns.“Housing has been essential from the beginning of time,” said buyers agent Mark Errichiello. “You need air, water and shelter.”Mr Errichiello said sight unseen purchases could be risky unless buyers planned to demolish or significantly renovate a dwelling.“You are making a big financial decision based on limited information,” he said.“You can’t walk through and get the precise dimensions or the feel of the space.”Nelson Alexander property consultant Charlie Barham acknowledges sight unseen sales are not for everyone but said the move to virtual inspections had given many prospective buyers the confidence to vie for properties they’d never set foot in.“They are becoming increasingly popular,” he said.Mr Barham responded to Nikki’s queries about her Fitzroy North home and arranged for the vendor to take prospective buyers on a virtual tour via Zoom.This was an invaluable experience, according to Nikki.“The owner knew a lot about the neighbourhood,” she said. “He pointed out all the features and if we had any questions, we could type them into a chat box. I wanted to know the condition of the decking, so he went up to the deck and showed us a close up.”Nikki doesn’t regret her decision and did her due diligence, arranging a comprehensive building and pest inspection and scoping out the neighbourhood.“I like the property and I’m content with the price,” she said. “At the end of the day I am the one who’ll be living there.”The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.102%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_16%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/d50f853ae6c4dfd88af38deb5a542debd0387e47

"Milkweed butterflies tear open caterpillars and drink them alive - Livescience.com
Not all caterpillars grow up to be beautiful butterflies. Some become living milkshakes for their dads, who guzzle caterpillar body fluids to attract the ladies.Recently, scientists reported the first evidence of butterflies sipping from the bodies of caterpillars — dead and alive. They observed adult milkweed butterflies in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, using tiny claws on their feet to scratch wounds in caterpillars' bodies so they could lap the liquid that oozed out. Male butterflies seek certain compounds produced by milkweed (flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae), which repel predators and help the butterflies produce pheromones that attract females. Since caterpillars are stuffed with juices from chewed-up plants, they make an easy target for butterflies looking to chemically boost their attractiveness to females. Related: ""The caterpillar larvae would contort their bodies rapidly in what appeared to be futile attempts to deter the persistent scratching of adults,"" said the researchers who observed the butterfly baby-drinking. They described their observations in a study published Sept. 8 in the journal Ecology.Butterflies in the Danainae family are known as milkweed butterflies because most of the caterpillars in this group feed on milkweed plants, which contain toxic alkaloids that are absorbed by the caterpillars and then processed into useful chemicals that protect them from predators. Another use for these alkaloids is in mating pheromones, which are transferred to females in the males' sperm packet ""as a nuptial gift,"" the scientists wrote.Most milkweed butterfly species are found in Asia, but four species live in North America, one of which is the colorful monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), . Male butterflies in this family are known for a unique behavior called leaf-scratching, in which adults supplement the plant sap they absorbed as hungry caterpillars by scraping at milkweed leaves with their tiny claws to release alkaloid-loaded sap for drinking through their long proboscis. Sometimes males gather by the hundreds to scratch and sip on milkweed leaves, according to the study.But on Dec. 9, 2019, lead study author Yi-Kai Tea, a doctoral candidate in the University of Sydney's School of Life and Environmental Sciences, and co-author Jonathan Soong Wei, a naturalist in Singapore, saw milkweed butterflies in Indonesia's Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve that were scratching at a different sap-loaded source: live milkweed caterpillars.""Multiple adults were observed scratching many caterpillars along a stretch of coastal vegetation"" that spanned more than 1,600 feet (500 meters), the researchers reported. They then saw the butterflies actively drink ""from the wounded and oozing caterpillars"" for hours, with the butterflies sometimes gathering in mixed-species groups. So intent were the butterflies on drinking from the caterpillars that not even the touch of a human observer could distract them, the study authors wrote. To describe the behavior, the scientists coined the term ""kleptopharmacophagy,"" which means ""consuming stolen chemicals.""""The alternative neologisms 'kairopharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from wounded caterpillars detected via 'eavesdropping') or 'necropharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from dead caterpillars) might also be appropriate,"" the researchers reported.— ——Over three days, the scientists counted seven species of milkweed butterflies that scraped and sipped living and dead caterpillars (it is unknown if the dead caterpillars were drunk to death or died of their wounds). One possible explanation for why the butterflies find caterpillars so delicious is because milkweed alkaloids accumulate in the caterpillars' bodies from the leaves that they eat, making their internal ""juices"" a more potent, alkaloid-rich brew — and thereby more attractive to thirsty males, the scientist suggested. It's likely that the butterflies are drawn to milkweed leaves that are already damaged from caterpillar chewing; those caterpillars would be close by when the adults start scratching. If a butterfly accidentally scrapes a caterpillar, the wound would release a heady chemical scent that would attract the butterfly and encourage it to scratch the caterpillar even more, according to the study. Many questions remain about this unusual (and ghastly) behavior, such as which specific plant compounds attract the butterflies to the caterpillars and do butterflies in other parts of the world also practice baby-drinking, Tea said in a statement. ""These simple observations raise questions about the ecology of these well-known butterflies, providing numerous opportunities for future studies,"" he said.Originally published on Live Science.Mindy Weisberger is a Live Science senior writer covering a general beat that includes climate change, paleontology, weird animal behavior, and space.

Beards aren't just cool and trendy - they might also be an evolutionary development to help protect a man's delicate facial bones from a punch to the face.That's the conclusion of a trio of scientists from the University of Utah who are among the winners of this year's Ig Nobel prizes, the Nobel Prize spoofs that honor - or maybe dishonor, depending on your point of view - strange scientific discoveries.The winners of the 31st annual Ig Nobels being announced Thursday included researchers who figured out how to better control cockroaches on U.S. Navy submarines; animal scientists who looked at whether it's safer to transport an airborne rhinoceros upside-down; and a team that figured out just how disgusting that discarded gum stuck to your shoe is.For the second year in a row, the ceremony was a roughly 90-minute prerecorded digital event because of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, said Marc Abrahams, editor of the Annals of Improbable Research magazine, the event's primary sponsor.No faces were punched for the beard study published in the scientific journal Integrative Organismal Biology.Instead, University of Utah scientists Ethan Beseris, Steven Naleway and David Carrier used a fiber epoxy composite to simulate human bone, and sheepskin to act as the human skin - sometimes with the fleece still on, sometimes sheared. They then dropped weights on them.The sample with the fleece still attached absorbed more energy than the sheared samples.""If the same is true for human facial hair, then having a full beard may help protect vulnerable regions of the facial skeleton from damaging strikes, such as the jaw,"" they said. ""Presumably, full beards also reduce injury, laceration, and contusion to the skin and muscle of the face.""It's obvious that those wads of discarded chewing gum found on sidewalks around the world are pretty revolting.But just how revolting?Researchers from a Spanish university determined the already-chewed gum that has been stuck to the sidewalk for three months is teeming with nasty bacteria.It sounds like a silly study, but as usual, there was some method to the madness.""Our findings have implications for a wide range of disciplines, including forensics, contagious disease control, or bioremediation of wasted chewing gum residues,"" Leila Satari, Alba GuillÃn, Ã?ngela Vidal-VerdÃº, and Manuel Porcar from the University of Valencia wrote in their paper, which was published at Nature.com.A team of U.S. Navy researchers won for figuring out a cheaper and more effective way to control cockroaches on submarines. The 1971 study that appeared in Journal of Economic Entomology found that traditional methods such as carboxide fumigation and use of the pesticide malathion were not good enough.They found that using the pesticide dichlorvos was less expensive and more effective.The goal is to return next year's ceremony to its traditional home at Harvard University's Sanders Theatre, Abrahams said, but much depends on whether the pandemic is under control and what kind of travel restrictions are in place around the world.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Bizarre 'dog bone' asteroid is bigger than New Jersey and has two moons - CNET

They found that one of the space rock's lobes is larger than the other and determined its length, which is longer than the state of New Jersey, or about half the length of the English Channel. A second study published in the same journal refined previously estimated orbits of the two moons around Kleopatra, allowing the researchers to calculate the mass of the main asteroid, which turned out to be a surprise.  Kleopatra has over a third less mass than indicated by previous estimates, a strange development considering it's thought to be metallic. All this suggests it's more a porous pile of pebbles than one big hunk of iron.  Rubble pile asteroids aren't that uncommon. There's reason to believe that  spacecraft, has a similar structure. Such space rocks can be formed when material from a major impact accumulates or ""accretes,"" creating a new body. The researchers suspect that Kleopatra's moons may've also been formed through similar processes.  Up next, Marchis says he hopes to point more-powerful telescopes at Kleopatra to see if it might host more moons or other surprises.  ""Kleopatra is a puzzling multiple system,"" the team's paper concludes. ""This system certainly deserves particular attention in the future, with the Extremely Large Telescopes and possibly a dedicated space mission, to decipher its entire formation history.""

"Epic Games To Appeal iOS App Store Court Ruling As Apple Declares Win - PCMag AU
Epic Games isn’t content with Friday’s court ruling forcing Apple to loosen its payment system for the iOS app store. A spokesperson for Epic Games told PCMag the company plans on appealing the court ruling. The reason is because Friday’s ruling only gave Epic Games a partial win. The company’s main goal was to try and convince the court Apple’s iOS store constitutes a monopoly. However, US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers wasn’t convinced. Instead, she found that Apple was only in violation of California’s Unfair Competition Law for blocking app developers from using other payment systems on the iOS app store. Hence, she ordered an injunction that bars Cupertino from the practice. Going forward, iOS app developers will be able to use third-party payment options outside of Apple’s in-app store system, potentially bypassing the need to pay Cupertino a 15% to 30% cut of all app sales.  “The final trial record did not include evidence of other critical factors, such as barriers to entry and conduct decreasing output or decreasing innovation in the relevant market,” Rogers wrote in her 185-page judgement. But interestingly, Rogers added: “The Court does not find that it is impossible (Apple engaged in antitrust); only that Epic Games failed in its burden to demonstrate Apple is an illegal monopolist.""The statement is likely prompting Epic Games to come up with better legal arguments in the appeal. In the same 185-page judgement, Rogers notes: “While the Court has found that evidence suggests Apple’s 30% rate of commission appears inflated, and is potentially anticompetitive, Epic Games did not challenge the rate. Rather, Epic Games challenged the imposition of any commission whatsoever.” In the meantime, Apple has been supportive of the ruling, despite the impending injunction, which takes effect in 90 days. “Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law,"" the company said in a statement. ""As the Court recognized ‘success is not illegal.’ Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world.”But for now, it’s unclear how Apple will adjust the company's iOS app store policies in light of the new ruling.",https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/news/e/epic-games/epic-games-to-appeal-ios-app-store-court-ruling-as-apple-dec_a2ac.1920.jpg,"It doesn't sound like EA is involved with the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake - Eurogamer.net
It doesn't sound like EA is involved in the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake.This week, during Sony's PlayStation Showcase event,  as coming to PC and PlayStation 5 as a console launch exclusive.Aspyr - the Texas-based studio that has collaborated with Lucasfilm on various projects for over a decade, including ports of the original Knights of the Old Republic to iPhone and iPad - , the ever-growing company that also owns Borderlands maker Gearbox.The question of whether EA is involved in the eye-catching KOTOR remake seems to me to be a reasonable one, given EA owns BioWare, the developer of the original game.The Game Awards chief Geoff Keighley wondered the same, and asked EA. Its response is equal parts hilarious and frustrating. Rather than simply say, 'yeah, sure, we're helping out,' or, 'no, we're not involved, sorry,' EA chose to state it makes Star Wars games - and that's it.I asked Bioware (and EA) if they are involved in the STAR WARS: KNIGHTS OF THE OLD REPUBLIC remake announced yesterday and just received this response.So I guess that's a no? That's right: when asked if it's helping out with the KOTOR remake, EA's response was: 'we make Star Wars games.'The video game industry has a habit of producing these types of desperately silly non-answers. EA isn't alone in that! But this one borders on the ridiculous. I'm guessing BioWare isn't involved, because surely EA and Lucasfilm would have said it was if it were. I think EA's statement is an attempt to remind people that while it's not working on the KOTOR remake, it is still going big on Star Wars stuff, but who knows?At least BioWare itself was clearer on the situation:We?re proud of the work we did on the original Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and genuinely cannot wait to play Aspyr?s Remake! As we continue our work on Star Wars: The Old Republic, we will watch with great interest. May the Force Be With You.Here's what we know for sure: the remake will be published on PS5 by Sony Interactive Entertainment, while the PC version of the game will be published by Aspyr itself. Aspyr is ""working in close collaboration with Lucasfilm Games"".",https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2018/eurogamer/illustrations/wesley-yin-poole.jpg/EG11/thumbnail/192x192/quality/50/format/jpg,"Ray-Ban and Facebook launch new smart glasses that look the real deal - GamesRadar
Ray-Ban has launched its first line of smart glasses in collaboration with Facebook - and you can order them right now.The Ray-Ban Stories range is the first of a new generation of smart glasses that offer a 'new way to capture, share & listen'. Aimed firmly at the wearable tech sphere the glasses provide people with the chance to seamlessly share and capture whatever they're looking at with their social media friends and followers.Cutting to the chase, the quick-fire tech list looks like this: dual 5MP cameras, touch controls, open speakers, a charging case (with USB-C port), integration with the Facebook app, and a blue light filter - which will help with looking at screens or gaming for sessions. Thus, these glasses have a strong feature set.Smart and gaming glasses have seen a rise in popularity in recent years, and the combination of tech giants Facebook and specialist sunglass designers and makers Ray-Ban seems like it could be a great combination to ride, but also extend, that wave.The 5-megapixel cameras aren't going to melt your eyeballs with quality but for something integrated into the frame of a pair of sunglasses, they'll be excellent - and positioned close to your actual eyes means you'll be getting an accurate picture of what you're looking at. And any pictures you take with them, you'll be able to edit on the go too, with the Facebook View app, allowing you to tweak your pics before you send them out into the wild.The open speakers will ensure good sound quality and the way that audio experts are cramming consistently high-end drivers into earbuds and the like, means that they'll be sufficient for podcasts, music, and calls - however, sound leaking will remain a concern. Personally, however, I would love to see if any other makers of smart glasses can design something similar to AfterShokz's discreet bone conductivity audio-provision; this is exceptionally good for keeping things private, and avoiding sound leaking - although you do compromise on some sound quality. Touch controls are getting neater and neater too - just look at the  - though being on glasses, and the frequency that one touches them, means it might be easy to accidentally engage with them. And while the hands-free commands can help you out for taking pictures and certain commands, this does mean this alternative is talking out loud a lot - to your sunglasses.We love smart tech as much as anyone here at GamesRadar+, and these glasses are welcome in terms of gaming glasses and eye protection, but we think there are some slight eyebrow raisers with the Ray-Ban Stories. First, you'll need a Facebook account which will irk some people. Secondly, walking around with two relatively obvious cameras on the front of your glasses might be a little frowned upon socially now, and make folks - friends or other world citizens - a little uneasy, given how easy it would now be to capture and record everything you look at. It's also a bit of a shame to be launching smart sunglasses at the end of the northern hemisphere's summer...But should the glasses get all this tech right, and manage to drop the usage seamlessly into folks' everyday life, then these might just be the most stylish smart glasses going right now. You can't deny that Ray-Ban sleekness.Ray-Ban Stories will be available for both those who do and don't require prescription lenses and will come in three styles and six color/lens combos. The styles are familiar-looking, chic Ray-Ban looks: Warfarer, Meteor, and Round.Ray-Ban Stories will be available from the Ray-Ban store, and retail for $299/£299 - though this can fluctuate a bit if you're after prescription lenses.Our friends at TechRadar have the full lowdown in their review if you want some more in-depth information.If the smart features onboard here have piqued your interest for other gear, perhaps consider the best gaming earbuds, or the best webcam to fill out or upgrade your setup.I'm one of the Hardware Editors for GamesRadar+, and have been for nearly three years; I've also been a writer on games - freelancing and the like - for four or so years for the likes of Eurogamer, RPS, PCGN, and more.

Apple is about to release the iPhone 13. That might not be the name, and we might not know exactly what it looks like – but something important is coming.That something is likely to be a new handset, which could also be released alongside a new Apple Watch, new AirPods and more.We will finally find out the exact answer to what it is on 14 September, when Apple will hold a virtual event to reveal the new phone. While it has not said specifically that the event is for the iPhone – and the release was delayed into October, last year – it almost certainly will be the launch of the new handset.Everything else is a little more unclear. But plenty of rumours have helped to give an indication of what might be coming at the event.The first question is what exactly it will be called. While we’ve been referring to it as the iPhone 13 – and will continue to do so – there’s no guarantee that’s what it will be called.One problem is that the number 13 is unlucky for many, though it is of course lucky for some others. That could lead Apple to avoid it, if only to keep superstitious people as customers.It is also a large number, and for the most part, Apple has tended to drop the numbers once its products get to a high enough number, and simply refer to products by their year or another name. That has led some to suggest that it could simply drop the numbering system entirely this year, and refer to it simply as the “new iPhone” – but that has been suggested for every other iPhone in recent years, too.The design changes may also be minimal, and Apple could just call the phone the iPhone 12S, as it has in the past.There will probably be four versions of the phone, in the three different sizes that are available for the iPhone 12: a small Mini, a medium-sized normal iPhone and Pro one, and a Pro Max. Those names seem to have worked for the existing line-up and there is no reason to think they will go this time around.But there is no way to know for sure. As with all marketing decisions – which also include the price, for instance – they can be changed relatively late on, and are less likely to leak outside of Apple.The design is likely to stay much the same as the current iPhone 13. Its flat sides, metal design and rounded camera bump is not likely to change much, if at all.Some rumours do suggest that the phone could get a little bigger, or heavier. Apple hasn’t shied away from doing that in recent years – it was once seemingly on a quest for thinness over everything – so it would not be hugely surprising if it has sacrificed some bulk for an improved battery, for instance.But the biggest design change will be the shrinking of the notch, according to various rumours. It will still be there – it is needed to hide the camera and Face ID sensors – but Apple is reported to have foudn a way to have it take up less space as it protrudes into the display.And that display is set to get improvements, too. Apple could finally bring the fast refresh technology that has been seen in its iPads – which allows scrolling and other behaviour to appear Previous rumours suggested that it has been working on such technology for previous iPhones, but had been hampered by its cost to battery life. Those may finally have been overcome.Various rumours have suggested that perhaps the biggest area of focus will be the cameras. That would be in line with previous years, which have radically improved the pictures the iPhone can take, and which Apple has often made much of in its introduction and advertising.Reports suggest that could include a focus on video, especially that for pros. It could also bring with it better performance at night and in low-light – something that might have been referenced in the event invitation.As with every year, the processor is likely to get faster and more efficient. Apple brings a new chip to each iPhone, and will probably do the same this year, adding an extra number to the chip name – the iPhone 12 is powered by the A14 Bionic,  and now iPads – and some better performance.Apple is famous for its surprises, and it does seem to have plugged up many of the leaks that once revealed its products in advance. So there could still be some surprise waiting to happen – Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

"John Howard says ‘clash of personalities’ ended Scott Morrison’s tourism career - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Former prime minister John Howard said Scott Morrison’s controversial stint as the boss of Tourism Australia ended for reasons including a “clash of personalities” with then-tourism minister Fran Bailey.New details of the bitter falling out are included in a biography on Mr Morrison, The Accidental Prime Minister, to be released on Wednesday and written by this reporter.Scott Morrison as Tourism Australia’s managing director in 2005.Credit:Greg TomanSpeaking for the first time about the events that led to Mr Morrison losing his $320,000-a-year job as the managing director of Tourism Australia in 2006, Mr Howard said he ultimately sided with advice from his minister Ms Bailey, whose relationship with Mr Morrison had become unworkable.Mr Howard, who distanced himself from the spat at the time, confirmed he was aware of the bitter falling out between the pair, with the “So where the bloody hell are you?” tourism campaign acting as a flashpoint in the deteriorating relationship.“The explanation for the dispute was a clash of personalities,” Mr Howard said. “They obviously didn’t get along.”Ms Bailey reveals in the book she felt under pressure from Mr Morrison to release millions of dollars in taxpayers’ cash to fund the controversial commercial, describing Mr Morrison as “unrelenting in pursuing his agenda”.“I was the one that had to sign off on $180 million worth of funding,” Ms Bailey says.After its release, the “Where the bloody hell are you?” ad campaign caused a stir and was banned from British television over concerns it would cause offence.John Howard says he backed his then-tourism minister.Mr Morrison insisted it was a PR dream and attempted to convince Ms Bailey that the censor’s decision was not entirely unexpected, but political insiders reveal the minister was growing increasingly wary of his assertions.With the help of former British high commissioner Sir Alastair Goodlad, Ms Bailey led an Australian delegation to London to push Australia’s case, shadowed by the ad’s star, Lara Bingle, now Lara Worthington, but deliberately excluded Mr Morrison.According to government staff from that time, Ms Bailey blamed Mr Morrison for the ban and told Mr Howard’s office that there was no way Mr Morrison could be involved in the rescue mission as “he’d stuffed it up”.But a source close to Mr Morrison said he was already in Europe for other meetings and laid the groundwork to overturn the ruling before Ms Bailey arrived.Fran Bailey in 2011 with former prime minister John Howard and then opposition leader Tony Abbott.Credit:Paul RovereAfter returning from Britain, Ms Bailey sought advice from then-secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Peter Shergold. The pair had a heated discussion about Mr Morrison’s future, but Ms Bailey had essentially made up her mind: Mr Morrison no longer had her backing or that of the board.In July 2006, Ms Bailey met Mr Howard and convinced him the relationship had deteriorated to the point where Mr Morrison had to go. “I accepted the minister’s advice and backed her,” Mr Howard said.Mr Morrison has not disputed the breakdown of the relationship with Ms Bailey.It was left to then-Tourism Australia board chairman Tim Fischer to break the news to Mr Morrison that his time was up, just over halfway through his three-year contract.Those closest to Mr Morrison believe he didn’t see it coming.“He would have thought he was safe and should be running the place,” one of his friends says. “He really didn’t see it, and he was gutted.”Mr Morrison was approached for comment.The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.307%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/4e999ffcddb75365ab1cb4fb4bf1e026e32afc02,"Peter Dutton accuses China of aggression and is called 'extremely dangerous and irresponsible' by the Chinese Foreign Ministry - ABC News
