"As it happened Australia v Pakistan first Test LIVE updates: Labuschagne, Smith hold key for Australia after top order leads fightback - Sydney Morning Herald

Australia reach stumps on the third day on 2/271, in reply to Pakistan’s 4d/476.Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith hold the key for Australia on the fourth day, which for Tests in this part of the world is known as “moving day” when pitches start to misbehave.If Australia can get bat well and reproduce another day like today they will be out to 550 with a handy little lead to push for an unlikely win on the fifth day.Usman Khawaja was a perfectly executed reverse sweep away from fulfilling a boyhood dream of scoring a Test hundred in Pakistan on Sunday, just a few kilometres from where he was born, on a day that Australia’s batters cashed in on a highway of a pitch and keep themselves in the first match of the series.Australian and Pakistani players left the field at 3:53pm local time with 21 overs still to bowl because of poor light, with the visitors cruising at 2-271 and reducing their first-innings deficit to 208 runs.After David Warner (68) and Khawaja (97) put on 156 runs for the first wicket, No.3 Marnus Labuschagne carved out a half-century (69 not out) and Steve Smith (24 not out) looked at ease in the middle.The fairytale almost came to fruition for Khawaja in Rawalpindi but a triple-figure score on this tour, Australia’s first to Pakistan since 1998, will have to wait.As Khawaja eyed off a third Test ton from five innings since coming back into this Australian XI, he pulled out a reverse sweep on 97, which had been a productive shot throughout the morning.Khawaja was given not out on the field but replays showed it had clipped his glove before ballooning to Imam-ul-Haq in close.Full report hereCovers are going on the pitch, so we’re done for the day. It’s worth noting that sunset in Rawalpindi is at 6:08 pm. There has been cloud cover all day and rain was forecast for this afternoon but we haven’t seen a drop yet.The light is even more problematic at other times of the year, outside the traditional cricket season of September to April (Pakistan do play all year round].Geoff Lawson talks about starting some one-dayers when he was coach of Pakistan before 9am, just to get play in.This is how bleak the picture is from Rawalpindi.At 3:53pm, players came from the field here in Rawalpindi for poor light. There are 21 overs to go in the day but I’m tipping they won’t be bowled.It’s definitely darker now than yesterday when played was called off early. Interestingly, it is my understanding that whatever the light reading was yesterday is now the benchmark for the rest of the Test.Facing spinners would be fine but the quicks? No thanks.The curators are now coming out into the middle. We’re yet to get official confirmation but I reckon that could be it for today. Combined, Pakistan and Australia have made 6-747 this Test.The umpires aren’t happy with the light, even with the floodlights on. Artificial light is dominating the natural light, so they’re coming off.I’m not sure which team is favoured by the stop in play. Probably Australia, as the batters would prefer better light to see the ball, but it will not help their chances of winning the game.They need as much time as they can to build a lead to set up a tilt at victory on the final day.Pakistan, though, will think with 476 on the board that they are still ahead but the pitch is not doing much and Australia, on 2/271, are making good ground.We’ll keep you posted on whether they will get back on.Back to the on-field action. There’s not much love for the bowlers out there.It actually feels quite flat without the trumpet today. The crowd isn’t making much noise either.This will lighten the mood a bit on a Sunday night. Some happy memories of the great Shane Warne.Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne reset well after the loss of Usman Khawaja for 97, but one of the trends of cricket in Asian conditions was maintained.A hard new ball in the hand of pace bowlers is easier to score against, allowing Khawaja and David Warner to get going. As the ball ages and the spinners close in, scoring slows and, often, wickets tend to follow.Certainly, that was the case in each of Australia’s past two series away to Pakistan. This time, though, Smith is back in the team and Labuschagne is at his best. Much will rest upon their shoulders in the final session.1 of 5",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Bigwigs pack corporate boxes as rain spares Mardi Gras parade - Sydney Morning Herald

It was a meteorological phenomenon which would have been most displeasing for controversial NSW upper house MP Fred Nile.The conservative who has opposed the march and progress on gay rights has famously prayed for rain on Mardi Gras every year since 2006 when he released a statement ahead of the protest event begging for God to “forgive Sydney”, saying he was praying for rain over the parade rather than “fire and brimstone”. But not this year, Fred!The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade enjoyed a break in the weather.

Two suites along inside Sydney World Pride’s corporate box, Gladys Berejiklian received a hero’s welcome when she arrived with her main squeeze, barrister Arthur Moses. The former premier was praised by Sydney World Pride boss Kate Wickett as one of the true believers and champions of the international event coming to Sydney in 2023.“When no one else thought it was possible, Gladys did,” Wickett told an adoring audience.In the parade, Lord Mayor of Darlinghurst Clover Moore was unmissable heading the City of Sydney’s superhero contingent alongside always-on-trend Sydney MP Alex Greenwich in a Kyiv Pride T-shirt. ABC News presenter Jeremy Fernandez was living his best life in an embroidered dinner jacket riding shotgun on a Harley.In an election year, the political contingent was heavy on the SCG ground. Warringah independent MP Zali Steggall headed the Independents for Inclusion float together with political hopefuls Kylea Tink of North Sydney, Sophie Scamps for Mackellar and Allegra Spender who is running in Wentworth.Labor leader Anthony Albanese led the Opposition’s marching troupe alongside Penny Wong, Tanya Plibersek and dozens of enthusiastic Young Labor supporters. Not far behind them, North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, Wentworth MP Dave Sharma and NSW Senator Andrew Bragg fronted the Liberal crew. This column revealed last week some consternation in the party’s rainbow ranks over the design of the party’s Mardi Gras t-shirts which included Sharma and Zimmerman’s names and no party logo, prompting some party members to shun the new design.That palaver had been put to bed by Saturday but it’s clear the new t-shirts haven’t won everyone over. On the evening, Sharma and Bragg marched in last year’s white number while Zimmerman wore this year’s blue t-shirt. Diversity in action.Clive Palmer has a busy Monday.

The claims came in mid-2020 as Palmer waged several actions against the WA Government including a failed  and failed challenge of a  In response to the defamation action, McGowan has hit back with his own claims that Palmer caused him distress and damaged his reputation by saying he “lied to the people of Western Australia” and was “abusing the parliamentary system”.

But the philanthropist’s absence was only a momentary blip for the theatre’s biggest fundraiser considering she was duly represented by her mother and Walsh Bay theatre namesake Ros Packer.The ever-gracious octogenarian set a cracking pace for the evening’s live auction. Ever the enthusiastic benefactor, Packer left jaws on the floor when she paid almost $40,000 for a dinner for ten at home cooked by chef celeb Guillaume Brahimi.Others in the room were more excited by the sight of MC and art dealing supremo Justin Miller dangling a ladies gold watch before the crowd. Not an auction item but lost property! It was soon reunited with Bondi-based film producer Rebel Penfold-Russell.Board chair and former CBA chief executive Ian Narev presided over the festivities and earned points with the crowd as he name-checked the event’s undisputed and unofficial guest of honour, former NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian - who was dubbed “Our Glad” for the evening by Narev and Miller.Unlike Mardi Gras, Berejiklian attended the bash solo. Her barrister “boo” Arthur Moses SC had spent the day in the NSW Supreme Court where he is representing former commando and alleged lunchbox-burying enthusiast Ben Roberts-Smith in his action against Nine Entertainment Co which owns this newspaper.Moses was notably ticked off by Justice Anthony Besanko on Thursday in the trial when the judge reminded Moses to make sure his tone in court wasn’t “belittling, insulting or otherwise inappropriate” to the witness.Perhaps Our Glad ran home to console Moses because her chair was empty when she won one of the raffle items - a Haulier Luxury Tote, apparently “crafted from robust selvedge canvas woven to size on mid-century shuttle looms.” Then again, it was a school night after all for Berejiklian who has just wrapped her first week as Optus’ new managing director of enterprise, business and institutional.Former UBS investment banking boss Matthew Grounds contributed an auction item of five days’ work experience for someone aged 15 years and over inside his new investment bank startup Barrenjoey.

And it’s one both parties have engaged in very positively,” he said. This bid has been enhanced . But not all presidents The Age has spoken with are convinced this is the right time financially for a new team to enter. What is clear is that the AFL cannot let Tasmanian football wither on the vine. The compromise may be agreeing to a licence but waiting until closer to the end of the decade for the team to debut.Yes, but just how it looks will be interesting. Discussions between the AFL and AFL Players Association have opened, with union chief Paul Marsh now seeking feedback from players during his annual road show. AFLW players are after more pay, and are keen to become full-time professionals by 2026. But do the economics match up? , but are the men prepared to cede income to help the women? It’s already a tricky question. It won’t be a surprise if the whole debate gets ugly., but would you rather have , the bull that is Christian Petracca or the extractor that is Clayton Oliver? And surely Gawn enters this discussion. Sam Walsh, fourth in last year’s Brownlow count, will have a delayed start to the season but expect the ball magnet to be back to his best by mid-season. Eagles ruckman Nic Naitanui is another standout and, while this may seem odd to say, a healthy Dustin Martin may have a point to prove despite his place in history already being confirmed. Don’t forget Lachie Neale and Patrick Dangerfield, the latter coming off an injury-impacted season, and then there’s Jordan De Goey, with his manager declaring he could be the best player in the league. “I definitely think he wants to be. Jordan can be anything Jordan wants to be,” Ryan Vague said.Brownlow medallist Ollie Wines.Credit:Getty ImagesIt’s an interesting debate. The Cats had 11 players aged 30 or older in last year’s preliminary final flameout. Dangerfield will turn 32 in April, Joel Selwood will be 34 in May, while Tom Hawkins will be 34 in July. They rightly deserve a win-now mentality, but there has been a change of philosophy . Even if Selwood and/or Hawkins retired this year, the Cats would still have a strong list, led by Jeremy Cameron, 29 in April. What they must do is move the ball quicker and overcome a worrying September hoodoo.There is no reason to suggest otherwise, even if it’s just for this season. History is littered with fallen empires – and we are only talking about AFL teams. The Lions of 2001-04, for instance, couldn’t get back. The Tigers, five years since their 2017 breakthrough flag, believe they still have enough juice in the tank in a team led by Martin, Tom Lynch, Jack Riewoldt (), Trent Cotchin and.Plenty. The Saints have a win-now list and Brett Ratten, in the final year of his contract, is under pressure. The Suns have backed Stuart Dew, but he is also off contract and has not experienced finals in four attempts. The spectre of Clarkson looms large.

"Japanese encephalitis virus detected in NSW resident - St George & Sutherland Shire Leader
NSW Health has confirmed one highly probable case of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in a NSW resident, and is warning the public to be vigilant and safeguard themselves against mosquito bites.The person is in ICU in a stable condition. They are a resident in the NSW-Victoria border region.Several more patients in NSW are undergoing further testing, and more cases are expected to be confirmed over coming weeks.Locally acquired cases of JEV have never previously been identified in NSW in animals or humans. JEV is usually only found in far northern Australia and neighbouring countries.JEV can cause severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.There is no specific treatment for JEV.JEV is a viral illness spread by mosquitoes. It can infect animals as well as humans, and has been confirmed in samples from a number of pig farms in regional NSW.The virus cannot be transmitted between humans, and it cannot be caught by eating pork or pig products.NSW Health Acting Chief Health Officer, Marianne Gale, said the best way to avoid infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes, which are most active between dusk and dawn.""NSW Health is cautioning people undertaking outdoor activities such as camping and fishing to carefully consider their plans. This is especially important for people planning activities near waterways or where mosquitoes are present, particularly the Murray River and its branches,"" Dr Gale said.""People should be particularly vigilant given the recent wet weather conditions, which have led to very high mosquito numbers that may increase further in the coming days and weeks.""NSW Health is working closely with the NSW Department of Primary Industries and other state and territory agencies to determine the extent to which the virus is circulating, through animal testing and mosquito monitoring.Mosquito control activities are being carried out in the vicinity of farms where pigs are confirmed to have been infected by JEV and NSW Health is arranging vaccination of workers on affected farms.Simple actions you can take to avoid mosquito bites include avoid going outdoors during peak mosquito times, especially at dawn and dusk, wear long sleeves and pants outdoors (reduce skin exposure), use repellent, especially those that contain DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus, and reduce all water holding containers around the home where mosquitoes could breed. as mosquitoes only need a small amount of liquid to breed.The warning follows detection of a mosquito-borne disease Ross River virus found in mosquitoes at Picnic Point, a suburb north of the Georges River, on two occasions in the past month.",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"Single test to screen for over 50 genetic diseases shown to be accurate - UNSW Newsroom
Medical researchers are now working on validations and expect the test to be standard in global pathology labs within five years.Dr Ira Devson. Photo: Garvan Institute of Medical ResearchA new DNA test, developed by researchers at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney and collaborators from Australia, UK and Israel, has been shown to identify a range of hard-to-diagnose neurological and neuromuscular genetic diseases quicker and more accurately than existing tests.The diseases covered by the test belong to a class of over 50 diseases caused by unusually-long repetitive DNA sequences in a person’s genes – known as ‘Short Tandem Repeat (STR) expansion disorders’.“They are often difficult to diagnose due to the complex symptoms that patients present with, the challenging nature of these repetitive sequences, and limitations of existing genetic testing methods,” says Dr Deveson.The study, published in Science Advances, shows that the test is accurate, and allows the team to begin validations to make the test available in pathology services around the world.A patient who participated in the study, John, first realised something wrong when he experienced unusual problems balancing during a ski lesson.“It was very worrying having symptoms that, over the years, increased in severity; from being active and mobile to not being able to walk without support. I had test after test for over 10 years and absolutely no answers as to what was wrong,” says John, who was eventually diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called CANVAS, which affects the brain.“It was reassuring to finally confirm my diagnosis genetically, and it’s exciting to know that, in the near future, others with these types of conditions will be able to get a diagnosis quicker than I did,” he says.“For patients like John, the new test will be a game-changer, helping to end what can often be a taxing diagnostic odyssey,” says Dr Kishore Kumar, a co-author of the study and neurologist at Concord Hospital and the University of Sydney, and visiting scientist at the Garvan Institute.Repeat expansion disorders can be passed on through families, can be life threatening and generally involve muscle and nerve damage, as well as other complications throughout the body.Current genetic testing for expansion disorders can be hit and miss, says Dr Kumar. “When patients present with symptoms, it can be difficult to tell which of these 50-plus genetic expansions they might have, so their doctor must decide which genes to test for based on the person’s symptoms and family history. If that test comes back negative, the patient is left without answers. This testing can go on for years without finding the genes implicated in their disease. We call this the ‘diagnostic odyssey’, and it can be quite stressful for patients and their families,” he says.“This new test will completely revolutionise how we diagnose these diseases, since we can now test for all the disorders at once with a single DNA test and give a clear genetic diagnosis, helping patients avoid years of unnecessary muscle or nerve biopsies for diseases they don’t have, or risky treatments that suppress their immune system,” says Dr Kumar.Although repeat expansion disorders cannot be cured, a quicker diagnosis can help doctors identify and treat disease complications earlier, such as heart issues associated with Friedreich's ataxia.Using a single DNA sample, usually extracted from blood, the test works by scanning a patient’s genome using a technology called Nanopore sequencing.“We’ve programmed the Nanopore device to hone in on the roughly 40 genes known to be involved in these disorders and to read through the long, repeated DNA sequences that cause disease,” he says. “By unravelling the two strands of DNA and reading the repeated letter sequences (combinations of A, T, G or C), we can scan for abnormally long repeats within the patient’s genes, which are the hallmarks of disease.”“In the one test, we can search for every known disease-causing repeat expansion sequence, and potentially discover novel sequences likely to be involved in diseases that have not yet been described,” says Dr Deveson.The Nanopore technology used in the test is smaller and cheaper than standard tests, which the team hopes will smooth its uptake into pathology labs. “With Nanopore, the gene sequencing device has been reduced from the size of a fridge to the size of a stapler, and costs around $1000, compared with hundreds of thousands needed for mainstream DNA sequencing technologies,” says Dr Deveson.The team expects to see their new technology used in diagnostic practice within the next two to five years. One of the key steps towards that goal is to gain appropriate clinical accreditation for the method.Once accredited, the test will also transform research into genetic diseases, says Dr Gina Ravenscroft, a co-author of the study and a researcher working on rare disease genetics at the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research.“Adult-onset genetic disorders haven’t received as much research attention as those that appear in early life,” she says. “By finding more people with these rare adult-onset diseases, and those who may be pre-symptomatic, we’ll be able to learn more about a whole range of rare diseases through cohort studies, which would otherwise be hard to do.”The research was led by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney, with UNSW Sydney, University of Sydney, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research, Pathwest, Westmead Hospital, Royal North Shore Hospital, University College London, Beilinson Hospital, ANZAC Research Institute, Concord Hospital.The work was supported with funding from The Kinghorn Foundation, Medical Research Futures Fund (MRFF), NHMRC, Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship, Margaret and Terry Orr Memorial Fund, Paul Ainsworth Family Foundation, Michael J.

Washington [US], March 6 (ANI): A recent study led by a tea of clinical researchers has found that women who got their first menstrual period (menarche) at a younger age are more likely to report chronic pain in adulthood.The findings of the study were published in the journal 'PAIN', the official publication of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).Also Read | ""We found strong associations between age at menarche and chronic pain outcomes in adult women,"" according to the new research by Charlotte Indre Lund, PhD fellow in Epidemiology at Oslo University Hospital, and colleagues.The findings add to previous evidence suggesting that increased estrogen levels associated with early menarche may contribute to pain, and to sex differences in pain in general.Also Read | The study included data on more than 12,000 women (average age 55) participating in the Tromso Study, an ongoing population study of the health of people in northern Norway. The researchers analysed associations between women's self-reported age at menarche and the presence and characteristics of chronic pain.The women's reported average age at menarche was about 13 years. About 40 per cent of women reported experiencing chronic pain.Women with younger age at menarche were more likely to have chronic pain. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the relative risk of chronic pain decreased by 2 per cent for each one-year delay in menarche. Absolute risk decreased by 1.1 to 1.4 percentage points per year. Across the full range of reported ages - from 9 to 18 years - the absolute risk of chronic pain differed by 12.6 percentage points.Older age at menarche was associated with lower rates of chronic pain in each of 10 body regions assessed, with the strongest associations for chest and abdominal pain. Younger age at menarche was associated with a longer duration of pain.Based on recently updated criteria, the prevalence of chronic widespread pain (CWP) was 7.4 per cent. Later menarche was associated with a decreased risk of experiencing CWP, with a risk ratio of 7 per cent and an absolute risk difference of 1.5 percentage points per year.Based on the new findings, the researchers conclude that ""Age at menarche is an independent risk factor for chronic pain, site-specific chronic pain, and chronic widespread pain and (thereby) contribute to the explanation of sex differences in pain.""Each additional year of delay to the first menstrual period is associated with a reduced risk for having chronic pain lasting 5 years or longer, as well as a reduced risk of CWP.

The first real-world study was done that shows just how effective the COVID-19 vaccine is at keeping children out of the hospital. The pandemic has been going on for about 2 years now, and the world seems to be going back to normal in some semblance. Vaccine availability has played a large part in that, and there are children all over the US who have received their vaccines. There is currently only a vaccine for children over the age of 5, and enough time has passed that we are starting to see the effect this has had in the real world.According to Medical Xpress, a real-world study was done and showed that the COVID-19 vaccine kept a lot of children out of the hospital. This study was done by the CDC, and it can be read in full here.RELATED: The study used data from 10 different states, and it showed that two doses of an mRNA vaccine provided enough protection that it kept children out of the ER and urgent care. It also showed to have high protection for youth from 12 to 17 years old and kept them out of the hospital as well.Experts are stating that they are now starting to see the same pattern emerge in youth that they saw in adults, and it shows that the vaccine is working exactly how it is supposed to. Vaccines are never meant to fully prevent someone from getting the virus, but they are meant to protect against hospitalizations and serious illness and death, and reports are showing that they are working.They also are stating that boosters are showing to be effective as well and that this is important information for parents who may be still making the decision about vaccinating their children.There remains a lot of vaccine hesitancy among parents and their children, and studies are the only way to show just how the vaccine works and how well it works. Now that time has passed since the vaccine has started to be administered, parents can be reassured that the vaccine is working and that it is also safe for their children.Vaccines continue to be the best way to prevent serious illness and death from the virus, and even though the world seems to be opening back up, it is still important to make sure children are protected, and this is the message that experts are trying to get out in the world.Sources: Medical Xpress, CDC",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2
"Gigs ‘just go off’ in Australia and Dave Grohl can’t wait to come back - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.After a hero’s welcome in Geelong on Friday night, American rock band Foo Fighters will return to Australia in late November for a run of national tour dates.Dave Grohl and his band, who last year were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,  and will be back to play stadium shows in Perth on November 30, Melbourne on December 4, Brisbane on December 10 and Sydney on December 12.Foo Fighters Dave Grohl and Chris Shiflett play to a sold-out crowd at GMHBA Stadium in Geelong.Credit:Paul RovereGeneral public tickets for the band’s first headline tour since 2018 will be available from March 10. A pre-sale of tickets for Frontier Touring members opens on March 8.Grohl, who had the initial idea for Foo Fighters , has a strong affinity for Australia and local audiences. He first toured here in 1992 while playing drums in Nirvana.“From the first time Nirvana came down, since then it’s always been this magical refuge, a place we’ve always looked forward to coming,” he told The Age and Sydney Morning Herald.“We’ve never had a bad tour — we haven’t really had bad tours anywhere — but there’s something about Australia and Australians we feel akin to … maybe it’s the love of big guitars. A lot of places don’t have that same passion for rock music as Australians.“Rock music is much more celebrated in Australia than America, we’ve got a great thing going on in America, but you come here and there’s so many great bands down here, and the gigs just go off.”Foo Fighters’ three-hour show in Geelong featured tracks from new Grammy-nominated album Medicine At Midnight, covers of Queen’s Somebody To Love, the Bee Gees’ You Should Be Dancing and Australia’s biggest, most euphoric stadium-size singalong in recent memory.The concert coincided with the cinema release of horror-comedy Studio 666, featuring Grohl and his bandmates. The film is based on a story by 53-year-old Grohl, who also released his autobiography, The Storyteller: Tales Of Life and Music, last year.“I don’t consider any of this work,” he said. “I’ve had jobs that I considered work … I know what it’s like to punch a card, to come into work and be relieved when it’s over.“I don’t get that feeling with this job of mine. I do feel very appreciative and very blessed that I am able and allowed to do any number of these projects, whether it’s documentaries or the book, or the horror film or this rock band or that rock band.”Foo Fighters’ Hall of Hame induction came seven years after Nirvana were inducted. Grohl said the recent ceremony in Cleveland, Ohio, when Paul McCartney officially inducted the band, was “amazing” and was thrilled his band could perform on the night.“Every single one of the inductees has really planted a flag in the history of music, but to meet and get a real hug from Carole King, it was unbelievable,” he said. “To watch LL Cool J completely steal the whole show … you’re surrounded by greatness, and you realise … that’s why they’re here.”Foo Fighters will also travel to New Zealand and play shows in Wellington on December 15 and Auckland on December 17.For more information and tickets, go to HPF Park, Perth (all ages)Wednesday, November 30Tickets on sale Thursday, March 10 (2pm local time)Ticketmaster.com.auPhone: 136 100AAMI Park, Melbourne (all ages)Sunday, December 4Tickets on sale Thursday, March 10 (2pm local time)Ticketek.com.auPhone: 132 849Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane (all ages)Saturday, December 10On sale: Thursday, March 10 (5pm local time)Ticketek.com.auPhone: 132 849Accor Stadium, Sydney (all ages)Monday, December 12Tickets on sale Thursday, March 10 (4pm local time)Ticketek.com.auPhone: 132 849A cultural guide to going out and loving your city. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.402%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_47%2C$y_31/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/9748458a9ebc316a87e896544494906fd031d8ec,"Why does Home and Away endure when Neighbours is coming to an end? - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.Since its premiere on March 18, 1985, for more than 8780 episodes – and still counting – Neighbours has gradually become a cultural monolith, an echo of Australia’s suburban roots turned into a nightly stage play about the mundanity of everyday life.Had it not met an untimely end, caught in the perfect storm of declining ratings and changing business models, you could be forgiven for thinking it would have endured forever. But the end of Neighbours is a cautionary tale about trying to have your budgetary cake and eat it too.Blue skies and bright colours. Is the endurance of Home and Away that simple?Credit:Seven NetworkIn the end it was not ratings that killed Neighbours – in the UK, it was still pulling one million viewers daily compared to 400,000 watching Home and Away – but a business model that crumbled because it depended on a delicately imbalanced production model. Without a deep-pocketed British broadcaster, and with Fremantle and Ten unwilling to make up the shortfall, the show was doomed.“We’re not talking about a show that has had seven seasons, we’re talking about a show that has had 37 seasons,” says television historian Andrew Mercado. “When you think of how several generations of families have watched it, people who watched it as a child and then as an adult. It’s sad when an institution comes to an end.”The bigger worry, says James Manning, editor of television and radio industry trade publication Mediaweek, is what will replace it. “In the UK and US prime-time dramas are still a magnet for audiences. In Australia [where reality TV is more dominant] that is not happening. Has the industry neglected drama, or is it changing audience tastes? It’s probably a bit of both.”In contrast, the sun is still shining on Australia’s other nightly soap, Home and Away. With a brighter colour palette and more location filming, its survival is a combination of better brand management and clearer positioning in the Australian market, Manning says.The cast of Neighbours in 1989.“Seven keep Home and Away on a primary channel, and they arguably do a better job of promoting it and investing in it,” Manning says. “There is a confluence of things. They believe in it a bit more than maybe the different owners of Ten over the last couple of years believed [in Neighbours].”It is bittersweet, says Mercado, crediting Neighbours for more creative storytelling in the last decade. “They have rebuilt their sets, introduced a fourth wall, they use their studio back lot well, every blade of grass. Home and Away perhaps survives because it never changes. To me, it is a show that is completely risk-averse.”Make no mistake, the loss of Neighbours will be deeply felt by the local industry. You may not miss it from your TV schedule since Ten sidelined it to the 10Peach digital channel in 2011, but as one of two key incubators of emerging talent in Australian television (the other being Home and Away), Neighbours more than pulled its weight.The show’s alumni include actors Margot Robbie, Guy Pearce, Ben Lawson, Daniel Macpherson, Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan. Less loudly signposted are the directors (Peter Andrikidis, Amanda Brotchie) and writers (Pete McTighe, Marieke Hardy) it gave opportunities to.“There are other ways for talent to be incubated – short-form content, online and digital content – but I think I am more worried about what projects those people can go onto,” Manning says. “It would have been good if [Ten owner] Paramount had more clearly signalled their future investment in drama. Will streaming pick up that space? I don’t know.”That loss will be acutely felt in Melbourne, Mercado says. (Home and Away is filmed in Sydney.) “That’s the part that makes me feel sick. If you were in Melbourne, Neighbours was a place to break in, to learn your craft. To me, this is like the closing of a film and television school. It’s devastating for the next generation of writers and directors.”It some respects the Neighbours which now begins a slow journey to the finish line in June is a show whose halo has faded. Once upon a time – long before aggregation, digitisation and streaming disruption – its characters and storylines fed into the national conversation.The nation watched (and sobbed) as Scott (Jason Donovan) married Charlene (Kylie Minogue) in 1987. We were shocked when, in 1991, Harold (Ian Smith) was swept out to sea. And then, five years later, when he came back to Erinsborough suffering from amnesia.Though the show’s glow faded over time, it could not be said they didn’t give it a red-hot go: there was the Erinsborough bushfire in 2008 (and the tornado in 2014), and the wedding of David (Takaya Honda) and Aaron (Matt Wilson) following the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Australia in 2018.Then there was Neighbours vs Zombies, the Halloween-themed web spin-off, featuring cast members Stefan Dennis, Ryan Moloney, Dan Paris and others, which rewrote the theme song lyric “everybody needs good neighbours” to “everybody eats their neighbours”. (No, really, there was. YouTube it.)And the many celebrity cameos, from American Idol judge Paula Abdul and British pop singer Lily Allen, to Little Britain characters Lou and Andy, who made a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it appearance in 2007. Plus Andre Rieu, Human Nature, The Wiggles, Shane Warne, Emma Bunton, Michael Parkinson and many others.In that sense, Neighbours is something of an historical document, chronicling four decades of slightly tele-warped Australian life. And on history’s page it, with Home and Away, completes a pantheon of iconic home-brand dramas: Bellbird, Number 96, Prisoner and The Sullivans.“They are all stories that are, in some way, recognisable to us,” says Mercado. Bellbird was about small-town life. The Sullivans was a chronicle of a nation at war. And Number 96 was a glimpse into the sexual revolution of the 1970s.“Even Prisoner was relatable, as the story of ordinary women behind bars,” Mercado says. “Each of those shows talks a cultural moment. And Neighbours and Home and Away, in tandem, reflect a sort of modern Australia, lived on the coast, or lived in the suburbs. They are stories of us.”The final episode of Neighbours will be filmed in June and will air in September.Find out the next TV, streaming series or movie to add to your must-sees.

Sci-fi movies have often fascinated us with the superhuman potential that the switching 'on and off' of genes can give rise to. However, in the real world, the expectation from this process is more modest, say tackling diseases. Opening new doors in this paradigm, scientists have combined CRISPR technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a technique where individual genes can be awakened through the disabling of chemical ""off switches"" that silence or suppress them.In a new multi-institutional study, scientists have used AI to create a protein, and then apply CRISPR technology to it in order to inhibit a protein complex called Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to awaken and upregulate several genes. According to the researchers, the new approach will aid in understanding the role that individual genes play in normal functions such as cell growth and development, processes such as aging, and diseases such as cancer, better.""The beauty of this approach is we can safely upregulate specific genes to affect cell activity without permanently changing the genome and cause unintended mistakes,"" said Dr. Shiri Levy, lead author of the study, in a statement. The research was published in the journal Cell Reports.What makes this technique unique is that the activity of the genes is controlled without any alteration to the DNA sequence of the genome. This is done by targeting chemical modifications that aid in the packaging of the genes within the human chromosomes and moderate their activity. As these changes occur on top of the genes and not inside them, they are known as 'epigenetic' (Greek: epi means ''above' or 'over') changes. Therefore, the chemical modifications that control gene activity are known as epigenetic markers.Epigenetic modifications are of particular interest to scientists because their effect extends beyond that on gene activity within the realm of normal cell function. The accumulation of epigenetic markers over time promotes aging. In addition to this, they can also have a profound effect on the health of one's offspring and future generations as they can be passed on from parent to child.In the study, the authors concentrated on Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), a protein complex. While PRC2 is active throughout human development, it plays a crucial role, particularly during the embryonic stage where embryonic cells metamorphose into several cell types that result in the formation of tissues and organs within the growing embryo.PRC2 suppresses genes by adding a methyl group to a protein responsible for the packaging of genes called histones. Methyl groups are structural units of organic compounds. If PRC2 is blocked, then the genes it has suppressed can be awakened again. Chemicals can be utilized to block PRC2. However, they are not reliable. Therefore, the team strived to find a method that could block PRC2 in a manner that affected only one gene at a time.In order to accomplish this, the researchers used AI to create a protein called EED binder (EB) that could attach itself to PRC2 and hinder the protein that PRC2 utilizes to alter histones. Following this, the team fused the fabricated protein with a deactivated form of a protein called Cas9.In CRISPR, a gene editing technique, Cas9 binds with RNA and uses it as an 'address tag'. This process enables scientists to guide Cas9 to specific locations in the genome by synthesizing particular 'address-tag' RNA. As a result, genes can be cut and spliced at specific locations. For this study, the slicing action of Cas9 was disabled. Therefore, the genomic DNA sequence remained unaltered; resulting in 'dead' Cas9 or dCas9.Nevertheless, the function of Cas9 as a vehicle to carry cargo to a particular location in the genome remained unchanged. The AI-designed blocking protein EB served as the cargo for the dCas9-RNA construct. Simplifying the process, Dr. Levy explained, ""dCas9 is like UBER. It will take you anywhere on the genome you want to go. The guide RNA is like a passenger, telling the UBER where to go.""Utilising the new technique, the scientists demonstrated that it was possible to block PRC2, and four different genes were selectively turned on. In addition to this, they also showed that induced pluripotent stem cells could be converted to placental progenitor cells by merely turning two genes on.""This technique allows us to avoid bombarding cells with various growth factors and gene activators and repressors to get them to differentiate. Instead, we can target specific sites on the gene transcription promoters' region, lift those marks and let the cell do the rest in an organic, holistic manner,"" illustrated Dr. Levy.Also, the team was able to demonstrate that the technique can be leveraged to locate specific PRC2-controlled regulatory regions from where activation of individual genes takes place. Interestingly, the locations of several of these regions remain unknown. Through the current research, the authors recognized a promoter region—known as a TATA box—for a gene called TBX18, which is associated with several diseases.This step led to the challenging of the general understanding that these promotor regions are near the gene, mostly within 30 DNA base pairs (building blocks of the DNA double helix). For the TBX18 gene, the promoter region was found to be over 500 base pairs away.Dr. Hannele Ruohola-Baker, lead author of the study, noted, ""This was a very important finding. TATA boxes are scattered throughout the genome, and current thinking in biology is that the important TATA boxes are very close to the gene transcription site and the others don't seem to matter. The power of this tool is that it can find the critical PRC2 dependent elements, in this case, TATA boxes that matter.""Importantly, the findings of the study shed more light on epigenetic modifications. ""With these two advances, AI-designed proteins and CRISPR technology, we can now find the precise epigenetic marks that are important for gene expression, learn the rules and utilize them to control cell function, drive cell differentiation and develop 21st-century therapies,"" concluded Dr. Ruohola-Baker.",https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/770091/dna.jpg?w=10&h=6

The world’s largest connectivity event dedicated to mobile technologies hosted over 61,000 attendees from almost 200 countries this week.The trade event (MWC22), organised by GSMA, a global organisation which aims to unify the mobile ecosystem in order to discover, develop and deliver innovation, is one of the first major physical trade shows in Europe since the pandemic started.“Nothing beats MWC (Mobile World Congress) in person, and it was exciting to bring our community – which is so passionate about connectivity – back together to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead.” John Hoffman, CEO of GSMA, said.The previous MWC in 2021 was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. At this event in Barcelona, there was no Russian Pavilion. In a statement, GSMA strongly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine. “In light of this emerging situation and considering the tragic loss of life, the MWC seems irrelevant in these circumstances,” it added.“The situation is fast-moving, and we understand that various governments are considering broader sanctions against Russia. MWC is a unifying event with a vision to convene the mobile ecosystem to progress ways and means that connectivity can ensure people, industry, and society thrive.”Among leading telecommunication companies, Huawei’s booth, which was one of the largest at the event, was designed to mimic a “DigiTelligent Forest,” showcasing the opportunities now available within the ICT industry.The space presented the company’s latest products and solutions, such as gigabit mobile networks, cloud-network “fast lines”, digital and intelligent operations and maintenance (O&M) transformation, and comprehensive green development solutions.Data analysis over the past few years suggests network O&M problems and major operating interventions are increasing by 5 per cent annually. Digital O&M transformation has become an industry consensus, according to Huawei.Other major highlights included Qualcomm’s announcement of two new components that will be brought to market, the Snapdragon X70 modem and the FastConnect 7900 wireless controller.The company also showcased initiatives in AR/XR (which the company referred to as “metaverse”), industrial IoT, personal computing, and automotive solutions.The concept of Metaverse was a big theme at the event. HTC, for example, unveiled Viverse, their own version of the metaverse, a digital space where reality meets virtual communities, cryptocurrencies and NFTs. Users will be able to move around several virtual worlds through a dedicated browser.Initially, Viverse will be accessible via dedicated “HTC Vive Flow headsets,” but the manufacturer’s ultimate ambition is to make it accessible from anywhere and any deviceWith more than 160 delegations from countries and international institutions around the world, policymakers, regulators, industry leaders, and the international development community exchanged experiences and views on how to build policies for a digital world, maximise the potential of 5G, close the digital gap, and meet global climate targets.Focus on the local entrepreneurial start-up community returned with the 4YFN (Four Years from Now) programme – supported by platinum sponsor BStartup Banco Sabadell – as it welcomed over 500 international start-ups and over 300 speakers to share insights on how to drive the ecosystem forward.Competing for more than €24 billion of investment, 200 start-ups pitched to leading funds during the event.“The momentum leading into MWC22 was palpable, and it delivered,” said Mats Granryd, Director General, GSMA. “In the spirit of our theme ‘Connectivity Unleashed’, we saw how industries were going beyond simple connectivity to deliver meaningful connectivity, deploying technology in ground-breaking ways that will shape industry and society.”Local initiatives like Meet and Eat Barcelona showcased the best of the city. A preliminary economic analysis indicated that MWC will have contributed more than €240 million to Barcelona’s economy and created more than 6,700 part-time jobs in 2022 alone. And once again, MWC was a carbon-neutral event.Following the event in Barcelona, GSMA is now working to deliver the full series of mobile world congresses in 2022. The next event, MWC Shanghai, will take place from 29th June – 1st July, followed by the inaugural MWC Las Vegas from 28th-30th September and rounded off by MWC Africa from 25-27th October – which will return in person to Kigali for the first time since 2019.Copyright  2021 The Brussels Times.

Apple is poised for its first livestream event of 2022 on Tuesday, March 8th at 1PM ET. The company sent out press invitation emails for the event titled “Peek Performance,” with  Apple will announce a new third-generation iPhone SE with 5G.The iPad Air might also get a new spec bump update at the event, with upgrades to both 5G and an A15 Bionic processor, similar to last year’s iPad Mini. Another rumor suggests an  alongside a redesigned MacBook Air might be coming. New Macs, including a Mac Mini with an M1 Pro / M1 Max processor update, could also get a showing, and new iMac and Mac Pro hardware are said to be in the works — but those will likely show up later in the year. Whatever the case might be, we might see at least one of these new Macs on March 8th.That’s not all Apple might announce on Tuesday, so prime your expectations for the Apple event by reading about all the rumors and details below.The upcoming third-generation iPhone SE is expected to succeed the 2020 model as the new budget-friendly iPhone option. The first iPhone SE came out in 2016 and remained available for four years, which means the SE line is set for a quicker change of pace.According to reliable analyst and leaker Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone SE 3 will probably include the latest A15 Bionic chip, 5G with millimeter wave, 64GB base storage with 128GB / 256GB options, and retain the design and colors of the current model. Kuo  on a verified account that has remained quiet until now.Some predictions for the coming new iPhone SE:1. Mass production in Mar'22.2. Estimated shipments of 25-30 mn units in 2022.3. Storage: 64/128/256GB.4. A15 & 5G support (mmW & Sub-6 GHz).5. Casing: white, black, and red.6. Similar form factor design to current SE.The 2020 iPhone SE offered shockingly good value with the then-latest chipset, but its battery life was never the star of the show. Now that US carriers only want phones with 5G on their shelves, the battery life in a new iPhone SE would be a bigger concern — especially if the form factor remains the same. The current iPhone SE body models the iPhone 8, but its aging design language dates all the way back to 2014 with the iPhone 6.It’s also possible that the iPhone SE could borrow the form factor of the iPhone 13 Mini. Due to reports of less than expected sales of the iPhone 12 Mini, it’s rumored that the iPhone 13 Mini might be Apple’s last compact mainline phone. But just as the iPhone SE from 2016 carried on the compact design of the iPhone 5s, and the 2020 iPhone SE copied the smaller iPhone 8 design, the iPhone SE might become the new home for the Mini.There’s no word on price yet, but don’t expect to see a reduction to the starting $399 price. 5G modems are still expensive, so a starting storage option of 64GB makes sense if the price is to remain intact. Touch ID would also keep costs down if the design remains.The iPad Air received an iPad Pro-style redesign in 2020: it got flat edges, thin bezels, Apple Pencil 2 support, USB-C, and a new Touch ID sleep / wake button. But the still fresh design is already lagging behind: the iPad Mini from last year followed the design of the iPad Air but one-upped it with with the latest A15 Bionic processor and 5G data options (though just sub-6GHz and no millimeter wave support).So it makes sense for Apple to roll out an updated iPad Air with the latest A15 Bionic processor and with a 5G option — and perhaps center stage as well. And although FaceID would welcome, don’t expect any other changes.It’s possible that Apple announces a new MacBook Air with a new M2 chip at this event. The current design of the MacBook Air dates back to 2018 and was a testbed for the Apple M1 chip debut in 2020.We reviewed the current MacBook Air with M1 as one of the best laptops you could buy in 2020, with a score that was cut short of perfect only because of the less-than-stellar webcam.But it’s 2022 now, and we have freshly updated MacBook Pro designs with better screens and a better camera that you can expect the MacBook Air will soon follow. It might even come with a notch.A new Mac Mini was , but it never showed up. Right now, the only way to harness the power of the latest M1 Pro and M1 Max chips is in the latest MacBook Pro models. A new Mac Mini with the latest processor options would change that.The current Mac Mini design dates back to 2010, which was made to be just large enough to fit an optical drive. So it’s about time we get a new Mac Mini chassis, but if we don’t, then hopefully, we will at least get a “Pro” looking space gray finish again. We could even see Mac Mini split up into a pro option and a standard option that comes with a new M2 processor.Right now, there’s only one iMac option with M1 processors, but it only has a 24-inch screen option. If we don’t see new larger iMacs on Tuesday, we might see it later in the year. The iMac Pro was also discontinued a year ago, so that would make for an interesting surprise, though there haven’t been any supply chain leaks that would indicate a new version is imminent. There’s also the Mac Pro that has no M1 option yet — and while it’s rumored to be in the works, don’t hold your breath for that one on Tuesday.The last time Apple held an event in March was in 2019, a live presentation that showcased new premium Apple services like Apple TV Plus. Three years later, it’s very possible Apple could showcase new TV shows or movies like it did last September.Some speculation of the meaning of Apple’s event invite title “Peek Performance” points to the word “Peek” as the name of a VR / AR product. While Apple’s long-rumored headset product is , perhaps there’s a chance Apple can surprise and delight — just don’t expect to see an Apple Car anytime soon.Apple is also expected to release some software updates: iOS 15.4 that can let your Face ID-enabled iPhone  and also a macOS Monterey plus iPad OS 15.4 update that will finally enable the iPad to Mac traversing Universal Control feature.Check out all the latest Apple news as it breaks here on The Verge.Please confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hdOrD2V50xZHae3K5CDsbVG2uY=/0x0:1198x728/1200x800/filters:focal(504x269:694x459)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70585589/Screen_Shot_2022_03_02_at_12.03.10_PM.0.jpg,"What Is AppleCare+ And Is It Worth Getting For iPhone? - Canstar Blue
Having access to a warranty or insurance can give people peace of mind when it comes to accidental loss or damage of your device. However, insurance doesn’t always cover everything, and adding on the extra cost might not be worth it, depending on your circumstances. AppleCare+ might be Apple’s own version of product insurance, but it is by no means a perfect solution, or the best solution for everyone.In this guide we’ll take a look at Apple’s own service and support product, AppleCare+ and whether it’s worth buying for your iPhone.

Is AppleCare+ worth it?

AppleCare+ is a service and support product, essentially Apple’s own version of product ‘insurance’. It can be purchased with an Apple product for an additional cost with access to service and support directly from Apple’s team of experts. This is separate to Apple Limited Warranty, which is included by default on all products, and is also separate to what you’ll be entitled to under Australian Consumer Law.You can purchase AppleCare+ for a range of Apple products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple’s headphone products, Apple TV, HomePod, iPod and Apple Display. What is covered and other details relating to AppleCare+ will differ between the device you are purchasing coverage for.One thing to keep in mind if you’re considering AppleCare+, is that you’ll need to purchase this within a certain time frame of buying your new Apple device. This period does differ between devices, but for iPhones, you’ll need to add on AppleCare+ within 60 days of your purchase. If you take advantage of a complimentary 7-day coverage offer (which may be available with certain devices), this period will reduce to 53 days. You may also be able to renew your existing coverage if you purchase new coverage within 30 days of your original coverage’s expiry.When purchasing AppleCare+ for your iPhone, be sure to retain any receipts and proof of purchase, particularly if you’re buying after you’ve purchased your device.Apple is notorious for its preference for its own services and repairs (rather than a third party), especially since iPhones tend to have more integrated and Apple-only systems included in iPhones. So, it’s no surprise that such a service as AppleCare+ exists to encourage customers to stick with Apple-specific care and support.You can choose between AppleCare+ or AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss for iPhone. Both will include access to the following:The two incidents covered under AppleCare+ are for accidental damage. AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss includes the same two incidents of accidental damage, plus up to two incidents of theft or loss. Theft and Loss cover does require you to have Find My iPhone enabled at the time the device is lost/stolen and needs to remain enabled (with your lost/stolen iPhone still associated with your Apple ID throughout the process).When it comes to repairs and incident coverage, there is, of course, a catch. You’ll be required to pay service fees for certain types of repairs, however these service fees may be a cheaper upfront cost if you have AppleCare+ than if you don’t.Another advantage to AppleCare+ is its Express Replacement Service. This means that you may be entitled to a replacement device before Apple even receives your damaged phone. If you’ve already used up your two accidental damage incidents but still need the replacement, you’ll need to pay an ‘out of warranty’ fee for $149 (for eligible iPhone models). Keep in mind that you may be charged a temporary amount to your credit card while Apple waits to receive your device.In addition to easier and more affordable access to service and replacements, AppleCare+ customers have the benefit of direct and fast customer service from Apple’s experts — whether that’s on the phone or via online chat and support hubs. Customers in most metropolitan areas may even have access to same-day service.Apple is a little tight-lipped when it comes to sharing how much you’ll pay for AppleCare+ for your device. Coverage costs will vary between device types, such as iPhones and Apple Watches, and will also vary between the models.Here is how much you’ll pay for AppleCare+ and AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss for devices in the iPhone 13 series:As previously mentioned, AppleCare+ includes coverage for two incidents of accidental damage (plus two additional incidents of loss or theft if you have AppleCare+ with Theft and Loss). These services require you to pay an upfront service fee, which is an additional cost to your AppleCare+ subscription. However, battery service is included at no extra cost if your battery retains less than 80% of its original capacity.Some of the service fees Apple lists, with how much it will cost you upfront (in addition to your AppleCare+ service), include:While bundling a subscription with your upfront service fees might seem a bit steep, keep in mind that without AppleCare+, the overall cost could be much higher if you need to pay for a repair or replacement. For some, the inclusions with AppleCare+ could pay off in the long run.Related: While additional insurance coverage is nothing new with consumer products, especially when it comes to appliances and technology, Aussies still have Australian Consumer Law and the product’s warranty to also guarantee some extra protections, without additional cost.It’s important to note that AppleCare+ (and an AppleCare Protection Plan) is a separate product to Apple’s own Apple Limited Warranty. Apple Limited Warranty covers issues such as defects in the product and lasts up to one year for iPhone (or two years for Apple Watch).Australians are also covered by Australian Consumer Law when it comes to faulty products and right of replacement/repair. What you are covered for, how long that coverage lasts and what you are covered under is different between the three products. The following table breaks this down.While the above table is a guide as to what you’re covered under in the cases of damaged, faulty or broken products, there are caveats to this. Apple has a responsibility, under Australian consumer law, to supply goods in a quality and workable order, along with a responsibility to repair, replace, refund or re-supply goods if it fails to meet consumer guarantee.Australian consumer guarantee in relation to goods, means that:It’s important to note that Australian consumer law is in place to protect Australians from faulty or poor-quality goods, and holds companies accountable for supplying quality products that work as advertised. It does not cover instances where a customer has changed their mind, damage that has been made intentionally, if the customer was aware of the fault when making the purchase and if a customer doesn’t have proof of purchase.If the quality of the goods does not match what is listed above, Apple does have a further responsibility to remedy the situation within a reasonable time, such as providing repairs or parts, or offering a replacement. Apple also has a responsibility to honour its Apple limited warranty and AppleCare+ products, on goods that require service, repair or replacement.While Australians are covered by consumer law, and when you purchase an Apple product you’ll also have coverage under warranty, AppleCare+ does cover some instances that aren’t covered by law or warranty. Having access to coverage for theft and loss, along with damage that may occur by accident, such as dropping your phone, may be worth paying additional costs for if you find that you frequently lose or damage your device.Related: If you prefer to pick up your iPhone on a plan rather than outright, you have the option to buy your phone from Telstra, Optus or Vodafone.

If you’re accident-prone or have had several instances in the past where your device has been lost or stolen, the extra security of having AppleCare+ might give you the peace of mind you need.It’s obviously hard to predict if you’ll be in a situation where you’ll need the protection that AppleCare+ provides. If you’ve never had a phone lost, stolen or damaged, and you generally take good care of your phone, especially if you use your phone at home a lot, the extra cost might not be worth the bother. Be aware of how much repairs or replacements will cost you, or if you have a spare ‘back up’ phone available to you.If you find it hard to prepare for the unexpected, you might want to consider setting aside a budget specifically for an emergency ‘phone repair/replacement’ fund. You could even set aside the AppleCare+ price in your budget in anticipation for one or two iPhone-related emergencies. After all, to get your full money’s worth from AppleCare+, you’ll need two instances of damage (and two additional instances of device theft or loss if you add on the additional coverage), and for most people, you might have just one instance of damage over the space of several years.Ultimately, you’ll need to decide if the extra costs and what AppleCare+ gets you makes the purchase worth it. As it’s a rather expensive additional expense that not everyone will need or find value in, it’s important to not get sucked into buying it ‘just in case’. Seriously think about whether it’s likely you’ll ever need or use the service before signing up to AppleCare+.**Max.

"‘Sydney in the firing line’: Fresh flooding concerns as more rain on the way for state - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later.Large parts of NSW will continue to face rain and flooding risks in the coming days, as more than 35,000 people remain out of their homes.Residents in Picton’s CBD, in Sydney’s southwest, have been told to prepare to evacuate with rising floodwaters overnight a key concern.NSW SES spokesperson Adam Jones said the weather system was likely to turn into an east coast low on Monday night or Tuesday morning. He added that while floodwaters had started to recede in some river systems, a new deluge could bring renewed flooding concerns.“We have had a busy 24 hours with over 1334 jobs coming in 24 hours. Of those, 38 have been flood rescues and the busiest areas are in western Sydney and the Northern Rivers area. There are 40 evacuation warnings out still, that means there are 35,000 people still out of their homes,” he said.Flash flooding near Shane’s Park in Sydney as flooding continues to impact parts of the city. Credit:Brook MitchellThere are currently eight evacuation warnings and more than 20 flood warnings covering the state, with the SES particularly concerned for residents in the low-lying Hawkesbury region.The Nepean River at Menangle Bridge may reach the major flood level of 12.2 metres on Monday afternoon, with further rises possible.“Over the next 24 to 48 hours, [that weather system] will move down the coast and there will be a lot of water in the systems,” Mr Jones said. “All up and down the whole coast, we are asking the community to prepare themselves and make safe and smart decisions around travel.”Weatherzone meteorologist Joel Pippard said in the 24 hours to 9am on Monday there had been widespread rainfall of 30 to 90 millimetres across Sydney.Over the weekend there had been heavy rainfalls in western Sydney of about 80 to 120mm, central Sydney recorded 30 to 50mm and the eastern suburbs had 10 to 20mm.“In terms of today, Sydney is still in the firing line,” he said.An upper low-pressure system is lingering over the state, drawing in cold and tropical air that is resulting in heavy rainfall across much of the state.Flood-affected areas in the Northern Rivers region and far North Coast are expected to receive more rain on Monday, with 5 to 10mm predicted for Lismore and 5 to 15mm for Grafton. Meanwhile, Sydney can expect 45 to 90mm of rain, while Penrith could experience 50 to 100mm.“It does look like it will get a little bit worse before it gets better,” Mr Pippard said. “The system will move offshore tomorrow and that means that it will spawn a surface low-pressure system off the Sydney coast, so basically any areas from the Hunter [region] and south could see some pretty heavy falls.”By the time the clouds are predicted to lift at the end of this week, Sydney will have experienced ongoing rain for more than a fortnight.More than 2000 homes and businesses in the state’s inundated Northern Rivers and NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet warned the recovery will take years as the true extent of the disaster becomes clear.Two out of three flood-affected homes in Lismore, which bore the brunt of last week’s historic weather event, will need to be demolished and rebuilt, or substantially repaired, before they can be inhabited, while more than 200 schools across the state remain non-operational.While the NSW government has offered payments to those affected by floods, Lismore resident Tony Bazzana, whose accounting firm in town has been inundated by floodwaters, said it is not enough to help the community rebuild. Instead, he believes the government needs to increase incentives for people to stay in the region, such as by subsidising flood insurance.“It’s hard to describe: it’s catastrophic. It’s just like nothing we’ve ever seen,” he said. “It’s like a war zone — there are no words to describe the community spirit but what we are facing is like nothing we have ever seen and the community can only do so much.”Insurers are bracing for the biggest flood claim event in history. Insurance Council of Australia on Friday reported that 67,537 claims had been lodged so far, with the number continuing to rise.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the scale of this year’s floods had not been seen “in living memory in anyone’s lifetime.”“There is an enormous effort that is being put in to get to everywhere that people can get to,” he told 2GB on Monday morning. “But the real focus of the effort is up there in and around Lismore, which has had an experience that no one there has ever even heard of before in old stories, let alone in their own lived experience.He added while he was aware that some communities remained cut off and stranded, work was being done to reach them.“There’s food drops and helicopter assistance going into Evans Head over the next 24 hours. That should be happening very, very soon. The task is almost unimaginable for a flood we’ve ever seen in that part of Australia,” Mr Morrison said.The biggest climate driver of the wet summer has been a La Nina event which has brought above-average rainfall, marine heatwaves and humid nights.The Bureau of Meteorology’s Autumn Climate Outlook for 2022 suggests that as La Nina wanes, Australia still faces a potentially wetter than average autumn, with night-time temperatures in many areas predicted to be higher than normal.The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.138%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/7c3f6d5f8f51d1462c0f521805317e9fd0f759c8
