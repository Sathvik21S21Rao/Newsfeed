"'Taken out of context': Nick Kyrgios clears up comments about cancelling the Australian Open - Wide World of Sports
Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios says his comments about cancelling the upcoming Australian Open were ""taken out of context"".Kyrgios stunned fans earlier today  due to the impact COVID-19 lockdowns have put on the Victorian population.""I don't think the Aus Open should go ahead, just for the people in Melbourne, you've got to send a message,"" Kyrgios said earlier on his No Boundaries podcast.""How long did [Melbourne] do in lockdown? 275 days or something?""With those comments making headlines around the tennis world, the 26-year-old took to Instagram this afternoon to clear the air.Kyrgios said his concerns were ""more so for the people of Melbourne"" and that it wouldn't be fair to allow players into the country who aren't vaccinated.READ MORE: ""First of all, I just want to clear up a couple of things. As you know, I've started a new podcast with two of my childhood friends, and some things have been taken out of context regarding the Australian Open,"" he said.""I just wanted to send this video to clear it up, and have a bit of clarity. Tennis has been such a big part of my life for 15 years plus.""I have given myself and a lot of sacrifices every single day for this sport. I love it.""To say I would want the Australian Open cancelled, that was the sentence that was taken out of context.""It's more so for the people of Melbourne, who have been through hell.

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Tim Tszyu will get only one crack at Takeshi Inoue.If the Japanese fighter pulls off a massive upset in their fight on Wednesday, which would scupper Tszyu’s shot at Brian Castano’s world title, the Australian won’t get a chance for revenge.It has been custom for Tszyu’s handlers to insist on a rematch clause, even when the 27-year-old is a raging favourite. However, Tszyu won’t have that safety net when he faces Inoue at Qudos Bank Arena.“A loss in this fight, a rematch won’t avenge what he loses,” said George Rose of No Limit, Tszyu’s promoter.“It’s not just a loss to Takeshi, it’s a loss of being the mandatory challenger, a loss of No.1 ranking. That’s the bigger loss.

That would change everything and he would have to start all over again.”The risks of taking on Inoue appear to outweigh the rewards. However, Tszyu believes that to be the best he has to beat all-comers, and has welcomed the challenge.“No risk at all,” Tszyu said. “I’m in this sport for 10 years, I’m here to make as many fights as I possibly can.

It’s you versus you, every day.”While both men will be significantly heavier by the time they step into the ring, this is one of the few times Tszyu won’t have a considerable size advantage over his opponent.“Now I’ll just be recovering, getting my energy back in, eating some good food, relaxing,” Inoue said. “I feel confident I can make this a really good fight.”Asked about his chances of becoming the first man to defeat Tszyu, Inoue said: “Yes, I do still feel I will knock him out.”The bookies have a different view. They have installed the WBO’s seventh-ranked fighter as an $8 outsider. Tszyu again predicted he will win within six rounds.“One thing I know is that I’m coming for his head, his body, everything,” he said.Should he prevail against Inoue, Tszyu hopes to take on Castano for the WBO world title.

"As it happened: ASX closes 0.7% lower; RBA rethinks inflation outlook - The Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.1 of 3That is all from us today, thank you for your time and your comments.The markets team will be back tomorrow with more news.Goodnight.The ASX sunk lower on Tuesday as it became clear the nation’s central bank was far more dovish than hawkish, leading to fears of price and earnings squeezes amid an inflation breakout. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 declined by 0.7 per cent to 7420.4 points, the largest one-day decline since 29 October. A speech by the Reserve Bank Governor and the release of minutes from the early November board meeting confirmed the RBA saw Australia’s inflation to be exceptional and well below that of other major economies.The target cash rate was still unlikely to lift until 2024, but that didn’t stop Westpac increasing fixed mortgage rates.The ASX200 closed 0.7 per cent lower with all sectors down except for tech stocks.  Credit:Louie DouvisLast week, US annual inflation numbers increased to 6.2 per cent, the sixth straight month of sharp increases.This pushed bond yields higher on the open market, adding to fears inflation was not ‘transitory’ as the US Federal Reserve keeps insisting. The inflation fears saw gold prices hit a five-month high of $US1,870 on Monday, and a 12-month high of $2,556 in the local currency last week as investors looked for a hedge against inflation. “The (gold) market is looking fairly positive,″⁣ global general manager at ABC Bullion, Nick Frappell, said. “People are concerned about the persistence of inflation and the fact that so far the central banks have not been too aggressive about what they are going to do about it.” He also noted that some people might see cryptocurrencies as a defensive asset, but they were more closely correlated to equities and had no historical proof of being a hedge. Major miners fell heavily as iron ore prices continued to soften with BHP down 2.6 per cent and Rio Tinto down 2.2 per cent. Mixed miner Iluka Resources fell by 4.1 per cent, but Chalice Mining continued its ascent, rising 3.7 per cent to $10.33. The financial sector was buoyed by a 2.6 per cent rise in Virgin Money UK, but dragged lower by declines in the big four banks, a 3 per cent fall in Magellan Financial, and 4.4 per cent drop in Pendal Group. Among the blue chip stocks declining, Telstra was down 1.3 per cent after its Investor Day, CSL declined by 0.8 per cent, and Wesfarmers fell by 0.6 per cent. Only 40 companies ended Tuesday’s session higher. This included a 1.7 per cent gain in Afterpay, a 1.8 per cent rise in NextDC, and 1.6 per cent gain in PolyNovo. Incitec Pivot increased 1.2 per cent to $3.28 as analysts wrote positive notes about Monday’s results.Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has conceded inflation could force the bank to lift official interest rates before its 2024 target while arguing it would still be highly unlikely.Giving a speech on recent trends in inflation to a meeting of the Australian Business Economists, Dr Lowe on Tuesday sought to play down the risks of a breakout in price pressures that is now hitting some of the world’s largest economies.RBA Governor Philip Lowe is sticking to his central scenario of 2024.Credit:BloombergThis week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the government was committed to “keeping downward pressure” on interest rates, which are at a record low of 0.1 per cent. The RBA is also creating $4 billion a week to support the financial system.But with inflation at 6.2 per cent in the United States and global supply chains struggling to meet demand, financial markets are expecting the RBA to start lifting interest rates here by the middle of next year.Dr Lowe said while there were signs of inflationary pressure across the globe, Australia was different in two key areas.He said energy prices in Australia were not rising nearly as quickly as overseas, partly due to increased capacity made available by wind and solar generators.Another major difference was Australia’s wages market, with multi-year enterprise agreements and the annual minimum wage decision creating a “degree of inertia” that prevented a sharp lift in incomes.Without strong wages growth, it would be difficult for inflation to pick up to a point that the RBA would have to lift rates earlier than its stated 2024 expectation.Read the full story hereAGL, the nation’s heaviest emitter, has described the Glasgow Climate Pact as a sign of the world’s commitment to accelerating the energy transition and averting catastrophic global warming despite the wording being watered down from “phasing out” coal to “phasing down”.After two weeks of climate negotiations, the final text endorsed by nearly 200 nations included for the first time a pledge to curtail coal-fired power, which British Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared had “sounded the death knell” for the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.AGL’s Loy Yang coal-powered generator, which is scheduled to operate until 2048. Credit:Paul JonesAGL chief operating officer Markus Brokhof said the changing of the wording following a last-minute intervention by India and China appeared to have been a necessary compromise.However, he said the nature of the commitments left little doubt about the world’s willingness to speed up the shift away from fossil fuels and achieve the Paris Agreement’s ultimate aspiration of limiting global heating within 1.5 degrees.“In general, it’s a clear sign [that] the energy industry, in particular the carbon-heavy industry, has to go,” Mr Brokhof told a UBS Australasia conference on Monday. “We are fully committed along these lines at AGL Energy.”AGL is preparing to shut down its Liddell coal plant in NSW in 2023, which Mr Brokhof said would strip out 23 per cent of AGL’s emissions. “It’s a significant step forward, but the right step,” he said.The company has also committed to reaching net-zero operational emissions by 2050.However, with other coal plants across the business not scheduled to close until the 2040s, AGL has come under mounting pressure from environmental advocates and powerful investors to commit to vastly stronger decarbonisation goals.At its annual meeting in September, the company was rocked by an unprecedented investor revolt as  requesting new “short-, medium- and long-term” emissions targets aligned with the Paris Agreement.Read the full story hereTelstra CEO Andy Penn has taken a subtle swipe at energy retailers that have moved into selling internet or telco services, arguing the telco giant is much better at understanding the needs of customers compared to the growing crop of new entrants.Speaking to investors on Tuesday, Mr Penn said that with the internet now as critical a service as electricity for customers, Telstra had the resources and the expertise in place to sell energy plans at scale.“Being a provider of telecommunications services...the customer service that we need to provide is very, very significant - there are a vast range of different things that can be impacting the internet...and it’s also become such a ubiquitous service that people are relying on these days,” he said.“I can’t necessarily compare with energy, but I think about my internet at home a lot more than I do about my power.”Telstra CEO Andrew Penn says the telco is well-placed to sell energy to its large customer base. Credit:Justin McManusThe comments came as Telstra said it would begin selling its energy and gas products to employees, before offering it to customers by the end of this financial year.Telstra announced in July that it had received authorisation to sell electricity and natural gas to customers in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and the ACT. It also lodged an application to sell energy to customers in Victoria.The telco already offers bundles of mobile, broadband and pay TV and streaming products such as Foxtel and Kayo Sports, but the move into the energy sector is a strategic shift for Telstra, which went carbon-neutral in early 2020 and has been very public about its attempts to reduce its carbon footprint.“Climate change is everybody’s business and there are no sidelines for any of us to sit on when it comes to meaningful action,” Mr Penn said in July. “It affects every business; every industry and every person on this planet, and to do nothing risks everything.”Read the full story hereBitcoin slid toward the $US60,000 level amid a broad retreat in the cryptocurrency market.The largest digital token was trading 4.5 per cent lower at about $US61,000 as of 11:57 a.m. in Singapore on Tuesday.

It is up a further 1.4 per cent today to $3.28 in a falling market. Morgan Stanley upgraded its valuation on the stock from $3.55 to $4.30 saying the group is ideally positioned to benefit from the current strength in global fertiliser markets.“We see further upside to prices from here, implying further earnings upgrades and strong cash generation.“Morgans also upgraded its price target from $3.05 to $3.75 saying Incitec has leverage to attractive industry fundamentals and the potential for further material upgrades.The financial regulator will require struggling superannuation fund EISS to review its spending and stop any sponsorships that are not in members’ interests, as it also pushes the fund to find a merger partner.EISS has been under intense scrutiny recently, after it was accused of wasting members’ savings on , shortly after it failed the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority’s performance test.Now APRA has slapped new licence conditions on the fund, and is pressuring it to find a new merger partner after merger talks with TWUSUPER collapsed last month.Under the new conditions, EISS will need to review its expenditure and stop any sponsorship deals and other spending that is not in members’ best interests, and it must also develop a plan to merge with a larger and better-performing fund by June next year.APRA said the changes were needed to protect the interests of members, as it continues to investigate spending by the industry super fund for electrical workers.APRA member Margaret Cole said the best way for EISS to improve the outcomes for its members would be to transfer them to a better performing fund as soon as possible.“Being a trustee of an APRA-regulated super fund, and managing – and spending – billions of dollars of members’ money, is a privilege, not a right,” Ms Cole said in a statement.“Although our investigation into EISS’s expenditure is ongoing, we have sufficient concerns about the trustee’s ability to demonstrate that some decisions are in members’ best financial interests that we believe it’s necessary to intervene now. Further action may follow, depending on what the rest of the investigation uncovers.”Jewellery retailer Lovisa hit all-time highs of $23.07 today following a Macquarie Equities report upgrading the stock to ‘outperform’ from ‘neutral’.The analysts increased their price target to $25, based on expectations of higher earnings in coming years as the brand expands into China and India with potentially 3,000 stores across the two countries. Meanwhile, on Friday Lovisa revealed it received $18 million in JobKeeper entitlements over the past two financial years and has not repaid any of it. The new chief executive, Victor Herrero, who replaced Shane Fallscheer earlier this year, has experience growing retail brands in China and India, according to Macquarie’s note to clients.Brett Blundy’s BB Retail Group has large stakes in retailers Lovisa, Honey Birdette, Bras n Things, Politix, and Adairs. Credit:Louise Kennerley“Collectively, the Chinese and Indian costume/fashion jewellery markets exceed that of the US by approximately 15 per cent,” the analysts wrote.“Given Lovisa’s track record, we are confident in it managing language, price, product and competition. Furthermore, while the strategy for Lovisa will only be fully understood in time, we consider the ability for international retailers to command higher price points in these markets relative to home markets as being supporting for the strategy.”They point out that opening 1000 new stores is part of Mr Herrera’s long-term incentive package. The Brett Blundy-chaired retailer now has a market cap of $2.4 billion thanks to gains of 94 per cent over the past year. Mr Blundy’s private equity group BB Retail Group owns 40.2 per cent of Lovisa.Macquarie increased it revenue forecasts for 2022-23 by 11 per cent to $495 million, leading to a post-tax profit of $64 million, which is 24 per cent higher than previously forecast.

COP26 in Glasgow sure has unleashed the animal spirits of climate change derangement.Andrew Liveris – professional conference panellist and global statesman without portfolio – has wrangled yet another interview in which to spout his manifestly unworkable policy prescriptions.Andrew Liveris speaks in favour of virtuous action while doing the precise opposite. Louie DouvisThe latest brainwave: “The federal government should set a carbon price of up to $US80 ($109) per tonne” and “repurpose its ageing coal power plant fleet with nuclear technology”.It is barely necessary to identify both of these proposals as arrant fantasy. Liveris might just as well argue for Australia to re-invade Baghdad.Speaking of Iraq, John Howard was the last national leader to propose domestic nuclear energy generation. The Australian people gave that idea a rock solid “no, thank you”, on November 24, 2007. Howard will therefore remain the last national leader to propose one.Australia will have a nuclear power industry when the first reactor is inaugurated next door to Liveris in Point Piper (across the street, Malcolm Turnbull’s house can quietly seethe in the shadow of its cooling towers).As for a carbon price, Liveris says, “Australia had one 12 years ago; it is time we had one again”. But even nine years ago, Australia’s carbon price was $23 per tonne, not $109.And Liveris wants his carbon price “raised in a way that did not mean higher prices for customers”. That would be a world first!A carbon price of $109 would add $10.1 billion just to the annual cost base of Australia’s four largest power generators. That is a $10 billion impost that would be transferred directly to households and businesses. The price of electricity would skyrocket.The generators couldn’t absorb it. At $109, AGL alone would be liable for $4.5 billion. That’s 41 per cent of annual revenue for a business operating on a 9 per cent EBIT margin. It’d be lights out, Irene.And yet again, Liveris speaks in favour of virtuous action while doing the precise opposite.He is a serving director of Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest producer of fossil fuel. While Australian businesses apparently need a carbon price “to encourage them to cut back their investment in carbon emitting ventures”, Aramco is increasing its output by 8 per cent to 2027.Its 71 million tonnes of carbon emissions are widely recognised as gross under-reporting. Is Liveris calling for a $US80 carbon price in the pages of Al Watan? He’d be .The heady mix of duplicity and naivety summons to mind the last Liveris soapbox: his  after 15 years (and $US262 million of executive pay) leading the world’s largest plastics manufacturer.Or his gas-led manufacturing boom that would require state governments to lift moratoriums on coal seam gas exploration on pastoral land – so, literally never happening.Liveris is a specialist in unworkable solutions to problems nobody asked him to solve. His desperation to be constantly in the newspaper overwhelms the onus to say anything of value.Liveris considers himself a trusted adviser to governments, including – at least historically – the Morrison government. Yet in the pursuit of just another headline, he now itemises a recipe for economic suicide.No government would survive a week with his agenda, not even the government of Point Piper, were it a sovereign country.

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Woodside’s $16 billion Scarborough LNG project is a step closer to reality after US investment giant Global Infrastructure Partners signed up for 49 per cent of a new $US5.6 billion ($7.64 billion) gas processing train at Pluto.The project is vital to Woodside which in the past month has downgraded reserve estimates for its gas fields feeding the Wheatstone and Pluto LNG plants in WA’s Pilbara.Woodside plans to double the capacity of its Pluto LNG plant in WA’s Pilbara region.Credit: SuppliedPluto marks GIP’s third investment in Australian LNG plants in 12 months despite questions about the fuel’s long-term role in the Asian energy mix as decarbonisation efforts step up.The deal announced on Monday relieves Woodside from fully funding the project if its purchase of BHP’s petroleum division, which owns 26.5 per cent of the Scarborough field, goes ahead.GIP will pay Woodside $US835 million in addition to its 49 per cent share of the cost of a second LNG train at Woodside’s Pluto project but if cost, schedule, regulatory approvals or emissions liabilities do not go to plan Woodside will bear most of the risk.The Scarborough project could have first gas production in 2026 and will require 430 kilometres export trunkline to connect it to the onshore Pluto gas plant on the Burrup Peninsula for processing.Woodside will reap all the savings if the final cost is less than the current estimate of $US5.6 billion but it is also fully exposed to the potential for a cost blowout of up to a maximum of 30 per cent. The train will be built by Bechtel that has a relatively good record of restricting cost and schedule blowouts on Australian LNG plants.Woodside will also have to compensate GIP if the liability for direct emissions rises above agreed levels and in some circumstances if the start-up of the train is delayed. The US-based fund can also sell its interests back to Woodside if “the status of key regulatory approvals materially changes”.Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic said the $US835 million carry payment looked strong for Woodside. “But in return for that Woodside is assuming a greater share of construction risk despite management indicating in the past they would be sharing it or fully with any partner,” he said.Mr Kavonic said there was insufficient detail to determine what value Woodside gained or lost in the transaction. In particular, the toll that Pluto will charge to process gas from Scarborough which forms GIP’s return for its investment and a major cost for Scarborough is yet to be finalised.Woodside chief executive Meg O’Neill said the GIP deal was a significant milestone towards a final investment decision.GIP was reported to be the only party negotiating to buy into Pluto after Brookfield dropped out in October.Environmental groups have campaigned against the investment in the hope of stopping the Scarborough project. Market Forces Asset campaigner Will van de Pol said there was no room for new gas fields like Scarborough if global warming was to be limited to 1.5 degrees.“Woodside has again shown its desperation to pursue Scarborough at all costs, with the deal offering GIP concessions on regulatory, carbon and construction risks,” he said.GIP chair Adebayo Ogunlesi said Pluto Train 2 was one of the least carbon-intensive sources of LNG for Asia.The next milestone for Woodside is the execution this month of an agreement with BHP to buy its oil and gas assets. The companies are then targeting to sanction the Scarborough to Pluto project by December 15 with an option for BHP to sell back to Woodside in late 2021 if Woodside shareholders do not support the purchase of BHP Petroleum.A WA Conservation Council challenge of a vital approval from the WA Environmental Protection Authority to be heard in the state’s Supreme Court on December 20 could provide an early trigger for GIP to exit Pluto.Other regulatory risks to the Scarborough to Pluto project identified in a recent CCWA report were possible changes to its emissions reduction plan and the effect of industrial pollution on the World Heritage-nominated Murajuga Indigenous rock near the Pluto LNG plant.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.517%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/b16eca91af3ab143113cbc76c1801d4bbc22586a

""Common Disinfectant May Promote Generation of Superbugs""

We tend to think of disinfectants as our allies in the fight against disease, a feeling that may never have been stronger than during the COVID-19 pandemic. But now a ground-breaking Macquarie University study has found a commonly used disinfectant may be a double agent, blocking antibiotics from working and even promoting antibiotic resistance.Antimicrobial resistance is a huge, ever-growing, challenge for global healthcare, and among the worst offenders is a group of resistant bacteria known as the ESKAPE pathogens.These common bacteria – Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species – are harmless enough in their natural habitats of gut, soil or water. However, if a patient who is already critically ill or immunocompromised comes into contact with one, it can result in life-threatening illness including pneumonia, sepsis and wound infections.One of the last lines of defence against the ESKAPE pathogens are aminoglycoside antibiotics, but now they, too, are under threat from friendly fire.Biocides are not regulated in Australia, and there isn’t a lot of information on what they are doing to the bacteria they are being used on.A team led by Dr Francesca Short and Professor Ian Paulsen, from Macquarie University’s Department of Molecular Science, tested the effects of the disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BAC) on aminoglycosides and the ESKAPE pathogens.“BAC is a biocide disinfectant valued for being non-toxic, and as a result is widely used in healthcare, food safety and agriculture, as well as in common household products such as antibacterial wipes, wound disinfectants, eyedrops and eardrops,” Dr Short said.“Our study found BAC could not only prevent aminoglycoside antibiotics from working, but also promote the evolution of resistant bacteria, which is extremely concerning given how widely BAC used.”Mutants on the marchThis study – funded by a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council – is the first time researchers have systematically examined the interaction between BAC and aminoglycosides.The team found even when administered at low levels, BAC can block aminoglycosides from doing their job, as it prevents the antibiotics from entering the bacterial cell.“It also dramatically increases the frequency at which new, potentially resistant mutants emerge.“Our results suggest that measures need to be taken to prevent the exposure of bacteria to lower levels of BAC – levels that are not high enough to kill bacteria but may be high enough to allow mutations to occur or help the bacteria gradually get used to the effects of the antibiotics.As consumers, though, we shouldn’t choose antibacterial products as a default just because we think they’re giving our families better protection.“While disinfectants like antibacterial wipes usually contain high levels of BAC that are sufficient to kill the bacteria they come into contact with initially, they still pose a risk as this compound has a long half-life, which means it remains in the environment for a long time before breaking down.“Our results also suggest that the effectiveness of aminoglycosides may be reduced by low levels of BAC taken at the same time, for example, if someone were using antibacterial eyedrops while taking a course of antibiotics.”Dr Short said further research would help guide us in using these products to best effect, while reducing the risk of them causing bacteria to become more resistant.“There are many different factors determining which disinfectants are best for hospitals, and obviously we can’t simply stop disinfecting surfaces in healthcare settings,” she said.“If you’re cleaning around the house, in general there’s no need to use anything marked ‘antibacterial’.“Ordinary soap and cleaning products will remove nearly all the germs. While it’s a good idea to use a bleach-based product on your toilet, you simply don’t need hospital-grade disinfectant for your bathroom sink or a wipe that leaves an antibacterial residue on your kitchen bench.“When it comes to personal care products like eyedrops, in future, it would be preferable to switch to single-use, pre-sterilised products instead of using chemical preservatives, as BAC not only reduces the effectiveness of antibiotics, but can also cause irritation and even eye damage with long-term use.”ReferenceShort FL, Lee V, Mamun R, et al.

The anticoagulant medication dabigatran yielded similar results to warfarin for the prevention of cognitive decline in older adults with atrial fibrillation after two years of treatment, according to late-breaking research presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2021. The meeting is fully virtual, Saturday, November 13-Monday, November 15, 2021, and is a premier global exchange of the latest scientific advancements, research and evidence-based clinical practice updates in cardiovascular science for health care worldwide.
                                                




 Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in older adults, and it is associated with an increased risk of stroke, cognitive impairment and dementia. Stroke can occur when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the brain, and oral anticoagulants, or medications that prevent the formation of blood clots such as dabigatran and warfarin, are typically prescribed to prevent stroke. Dabigatran has been found to be comparable to warfarin for the prevention of stroke and also has a lower risk of major bleeding complications.
Previous research has found that people with atrial fibrillation taking oral anticoagulation therapy have a lower risk of dementia, however, the mechanism involved in this benefit is unknown, and previous clinical trials have not evaluated cognitive and functional impairment outcomes among patients.
""It's possible that cognitive decline is related to the formation of small blood clots in the brain, which may be attacked by effective medications that prevent blood clots,"" said lead study author Bruno Caramelli, M.D., associate professor of medicine at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. ""Since dabigatran offers a more stable anticoagulation status, we investigated whether it may be more effective than warfarin for the prevention of cognitive decline in patients with atrial fibrillation.""
The study, known as GIRAF, (acronym for CoGnitive Impairment Related to Atrial Fibrillation) is a two-year randomized, multi-center, prospective trial in Brazil evaluating the effects of dabigatran and warfarin on cognitive and functional impairment, bleeding occurrence and cerebrovascular complications in older patients with atrial fibrillation.
This study included 200 adults over age 70 with confirmed atrial fibrillation, and about 62% of the study participants were male. Participants were randomly assigned to take dabigatran (110 or 150 mg twice daily) or warfarin (once daily, dose controlled based on how long it takes the blood to clot) for two years. Patients also had a brain MRI at baseline and after two years to identify possible strokes.
Participants completed 90-minute cognitive and functional evaluations at the one-year and two-year follow-up visits. Another MRI was performed at the end of the two-year study period to identify possible cerebrovascular events.
The researchers found that after two years:
no participant was diagnosed with dementia during the trial, and,   among the entire study population, there was less than a half point difference (statistically not significant) between study participants taking warfarin and those taking dabigatran on scales measuring memory, executive functions, language and attention from baseline.
These findings highlight the importance of adequate anticoagulation treatment to decrease cognitive decline in older atrial fibrillation patients. In addition, the GIRAF researchers concluded that among older patients with atrial fibrillation who were adequately treated with warfarin or dabigatran, there was no difference in cognitive outcomes after two years of treatment.
""Cognitive aspects are important for patients with atrial fibrillation, and these results could help guide the decision about which oral anticoagulation medication should be prescribed,"" Caramelli said. ""Further studies are needed to explore new concepts on potential prevention of cognitive decline and the possible benefits of treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation and their families.""

Stem cell therapy helped to reduce the number of heart attacks, strokes and death among people with chronic, high-risk, NYHA class II or III heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), especially among those who have higher levels of inflammation, yet hospitalization was not reduced, according to late-breaking research presented today at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2021.
                                                




 Heart failure is a condition when the heart is unable to adequately pump blood to meet the body's need for oxygen and nutrients. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the heart muscle enlarges and weakens, resulting in a decrease in pumping ability and fluid buildup in the body's tissues. Inflammation plays a significant role in the progression of heart failure over time.
This study set out to examine the effects of using stem cells (mesenchymal precursor cells) injected into the heart to target inflammation and treat chronic heart failure. Researchers hypothesized that a single injection of stem cells from healthy adult donors in addition to guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure would affect the number of times participants were hospitalized for heart failure events and reduce heart attacks, strokes, and/or death.
""Cell therapy has the potential to change how we treat heart failure,"" says Emerson C. Perin, M.D., Ph.D., the study's lead author, the director of the Center for Clinical Research and medical director of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston. ""This study addresses the inflammatory aspects of heart failure, which go mostly untreated, despite significant pharmaceutical and device therapy development. Our findings indicate stem cell therapy may be considered for use in addition to standard guideline therapies.""
The ""Randomized Trial of Targeted Transendocardial Delivery of Mesenchymal Precursor Cells in High-Risk Chronic Heart Failure Patients with Reduced Ejection Fraction"" study also called the DREAM-HF trial, is the largest stem cell therapy study to date among people with heart failure. In this multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial, researchers enrolled 537 participants (average age 63, 20 percent female) with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, which is when the left side of the heart, its main pumping chamber, is significantly weakened.






Heart failure was defined using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. This classification system places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited during physical activity. Class I heart failure means no limitation of physical activity, with class IV heart failure meaning an inability to have any physical activity without discomfort.
Participants were randomly divided into two groups: 261 adults received an injection of 150 million mesenchymal precursor cells, commonly known as stem cells, directly into the heart using a catheter. The remaining 276 adults received a scripted, or sham, procedure. Healthy adult donors provided the mesenchymal precursor cells.
The study participants were discharged from the hospital the day after the procedure, and researchers followed these participants for an average of 30 months. The study's focus was to examine if the stem cell treatment affected the likelihood of participants returning to the hospital for treatment of worsening heart failure. They also tracked whether participants had a heart attack or stroke, or died, and measured levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a measure in the blood indicating inflammation.
While researchers did not see a decrease in hospitalizations due to the stem cell treatment, they did notice several other significant results. The findings include:
Those who received stem cell therapy had a 65 percent reduction in non-fatal heart attacks and stroke throughout the period of the study;Participants with high levels of inflammation (CRP levels of at least 2 mg/L) were 79 percent less likely to have non-fatal heart attack or stroke after being treated with stem cells; and,Stem cell treatment reduced cardiac death by 80 percent in people with high levels of inflammation and less severe, class II HF.
""We were impressed to learn that stem cell treatment effects were additive to current standard heart failure treatments,"" says Perin. ""For the first time, the known anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of these cells may be linked to a cause-and-effect benefit in heart failure. The stem cells acted locally in the heart, and they also helped in blood vessels throughout the body.""
Perin and colleagues believe further research is needed to better understand how these stem cells may affect the course of progression of heart failure and how these therapies may be directed to the patient groups that could see the most benefits.
Limitations to the research include the selection of endpoints commonly used in heart failure studies. The study's results suggest that traditional endpoints associated with recurrent heart failure hospitalization do not fully reveal the benefits or mechanisms of these stem cells on heart attack, stroke and death in patients with chronic heart failure.

"Taylor Swift’s All Too Well short film: control the narrative, you win - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Taylor Swift isn’t afraid to portray herself as a victim of men depicted as caddish, even if it’s only as a preamble to emerging victorious. And it’s a dynamic she wields to devastating effect in All Too Well: The Short Film.This 14-minute music-video-with-dramatic-bits depicts a young woman at the mercy of an older man’s emotional dishonesty. Though he’s unnamed in the song, which was originally released in 2012 and has now been re-recorded for her album Red (Taylor’s Version) – part of her campaign  – Swift’s fans believe it to be Jake Gyllenhaal.Since her back catalogue was sold (and sold again) Taylor Swift has set about re-recording her first six albums.Credit:APAnd now, prompted by the video written and directed by the 31-year-old Swift, they have turned on the 40-year-old actor on social media with the fury of a fanbase scorned.“You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath,” Taylor sings in reference, the internet is certain, to the three-month affair between a then-20-year-old Swift and the then-29-year-old Gyllenhaal some 11 years ago. “You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine, and that made me want to die.”The film stars Sadie Sink as “her” and Dylan O’Brien as “him”, and is full of gorgeously cliched Notebook-style images of romance: dewy-eyed drives into the country; spontaneous piggyback rides through an autumnal forest; wine and cheese in front of a roaring fire. But then comes the crash: the hand spurned at the dinner table; the lonely wandering through an older crowd at an art opening; the angry scene in the kitchen after the guests have gone home. Oh, and the scarf.“You keep my old scarf from that very first week, cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me. You can’t get rid of it cause you remember it all too well.”How did it come to this? Jake Gyllenhaal has suddenly found himself the most hated man in the Twitterverse. Credit:Richard ShotwellTaylor is a great storyteller and a not-bad director, and there’s bound to be some sort of power imbalance in any relationship between a 20-year-old and a 29-year-old. But I’m wondering if the dice aren’t just a little loaded here.The film’s Taylor avatar clings to Fake-Jake like a limpet, with no boundaries when it comes to public displays of affection. Little wonder, perhaps, that he shrugs off her hand at dinner with his mates, unknowingly in his telling, callously in hers. She has a finely tuned sense of offence and a fiery temper, as seen in the kitchen-sink argument scene (almost an exact copy of one from the 2009 video for Mine, which Swift also directed).She refers to herself as “the one true thing you’ve ever known”. In a scene set 13 years later, the older Fake-Jake stands outside in the snow (still wearing that regret-scented scarf), gazing longingly at the older, wiser narrator (the actual Taylor Swift) as she reads from her novel All Too Well. A poster declares it “a stunning debut”.In case you haven’t got the message yet, Taylor wins.Swift has built a career on turning crash-and-burn love affairs into superb tell-all pop songs. In her world, romances start like Mills and Boon and end like Burton and Taylor. Almost without exception, she is the injured party. It’s emotionally, lyrically and musically compelling, but there’s not much room for the idea of two sides to every story.In a sense, Swift’s campaign to re-record her past works is all about having the last word too. And in this it’s hard not to support her.She was furious when Scott Borchetta, boss of her old label Big Machine, sold the rights to her first six albums in 2019 to music manager Scooter Braun, with whom she’d had a long-running feud (Braun onsold a chunk of those rights to a private equity firm last November). So she has set about re-recording, virtually note-for-note, those six albums, to be released under her new and vastly improved deal with Universal.Red (Taylor’s Version) is the second album to be released under this arrangement, , and its impact on the value of the original recordings is likely to be significant.Writer-director Taylor Swift, centre, with Dylan O’Brien and Sadie Sink, the stars of her short film All Too Well.Credit:Evan AgostiniThe original 2008 recording of Fearless was dislodged from the Billboard top 200 album chart in April when the new version debuted at number one. The new version of Red has again made Swift the most streamed artist in the world. Her short film has racked up more than 32 million views on YouTube in just three days.Perhaps most importantly, when it comes to licensing Swift’s music for movies, TV shows and commercials in the future, it’s likely to be her versions that get precedence. No brand or show will want to risk a backlash from the fanbase like the one Jake Gyllenhaal has had to deal with over the past few days.She may occasionally cast herself as the victim, but whether she’s taking on a label or an ex-lover, Taylor Swift is anything but. The importance of controlling the narrative, and turning it to her advantage, is something she knows all too well.Email the author at kquinn@theage.com.au, or follow him on Facebook at karlquinnjournalist and on Twitter @karlkwin",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.395%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_19/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/a3046e974646372605a7786c784e224b729a9889,"Leaked email reveals Meghan was furious over reports she had a stylist - Sky News Australia
Meghan Markle once complained that the Royal Family controlled every aspect of her life besides her own style, and was furious when reports suggested otherwise, a leaked email has revealed.The Mail on Sunday newspaper is seeking to overturn a ruling that it breached Meghan Markle’s privacy by publishing a series of articles based on a letter provided to the publications by her father Thomas Markle.She apologised to the Court after texts revealed she anticipated the personal letter to her father could be leaked and that it would “pull at heartstrings”.Bombshell texts between Ms Markle and her communications advisor Jason Knauf revealed her motivation when crafting the letter.

"Russia debris threatens ISS astronauts - Goulburn Post
A Russian weapons test has created more than 1500 pieces of space junk that is threatening the seven astronauts aboard the International Space Station, US officials say.The State Department confirmed the debris was from an old Russian satellite destroyed in Monday's anti-satellite weapons test.""It was dangerous. It was reckless. It was irresponsible,"" said State Department spokesman Ned Price.Earlier on Monday, the four Americans, one German and two Russians on board were forced to seek shelter in their docked capsules because of the debris.At least 1500 pieces of the destroyed satellite were sizeable enough to show up on radar, Price said.But countless other fragments were too small to track, yet still posed a danger to the space station as well as orbiting satellites.""We are going to continue to make very clear that we won't tolerate this kind of activity,"" Price said.NASA Mission Control said the heightened threat might continue for another couple of days and continue to interrupt the astronauts' science research and other work.Four of the seven crew members arrived at the orbiting outpost Thursday night.NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei, who is midway through a year-long mission, called it ""a crazy but well-coordinated day"" as he bid Mission Control good night.""It was certainly a great way to bond as a crew, starting off with our very first work day in space,"" he said.The US Space Command said it was tracking the field of orbiting debris. NASA had made no comment by mid-afternoon.Earlier in the day, the Russian Space Agency said via Twitter the astronauts were ordered into their docked capsules, in case they had to make a quick getaway. Later, the crew was ""routinely performing operations,"" the agency noted.""Friends, everything is regular with us!"" tweeted the space station's commander, Russian Anton Shkaplerov.The cloud of debris seemed to pose a threat on each passing orbit - or every 90 minutes. German astronaut Matthias Maurer was told to move his sleeping bag from the European lab to a safer location for the night.Until Monday, some 20,000 pieces of space junk were being tracked including old and broken satellites.Last week, a fragment from an old Chinese satellite - the target of a missile-strike test in 2007 - threatened to come uncomfortably close.While it later was dismissed as a risk, NASA had the space station move anyway.Australian Associated Press",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"A 97 Per Cent Partial Lunar Eclipse Is Happening on Friday – Here's How and When To See It - Broadsheet
Total lunar eclipse photographed in May 2021 from Sydney ObservatoryKarlie Noon, astrophysicistCancel your early-bird dinner date on Friday – there’s going to be a perfectly timed partial lunar eclipse that, without a telescope, will look a lot like a total lunar eclipse. “At 97 per cent, we’re getting very close [to a total lunar eclipse],” says Kamilaroi astrophysicist Karlie Noon. “To our human eyes, it’d be very unlikely we’d see that sliver of three per cent that isn’t eclipsed.”Friday night’s partial lunar eclipse is a somewhat rare chance to see the moon tinted deep red thanks to the effects of light passing through the Earth’s shadow. “Visually, we will have this beautiful, spectacular full moon and we’ll be able to see it go from this luminous white colour to a really deep red that is almost going to look like Mars. It’s an effect that will be visible all around the world, and it’s not that common to be able to see the same phenomenon around the world,” Noon tells Broadsheet. In the Southern Hemisphere, the partial eclipse will be visible just after sunset – exact times are listed below. “It’s going to take a little bit of time for the sky to start getting dark, but you’re going to be able to see some lingering effects until about 9pm.“My recommendation, if you ever want to see something up in the sky, is to get up high,” says Noon. “Go somewhere dark. You don’t have to leave the city, but if you can face away from the bright lights with the moon in front of you, it will help reduce the effects of light pollution.” The moon will be rising in the north-east, and if you want to get the best possible view without going outside, you can tune into a  hosted by Noon, fellow astrophysicist Dr Andrew Jacob and Sydney Observatory astronomy ambassador Kat Ross. It’s an opportunity to see it in “high definition”, says Noon. “I’m doing a PhD in astrophysics and I don’t have a telescope – they’re really expensive pieces of equipment – so this is an opportunity to see it up close but also to listen to really fantastic Australian scientists.”Noon, the first Aboriginal woman in Australia to graduate with a double degree in mathematics and physics, will be sharing perspectives from First Nations scientists and storytellers. She says the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land often talk about seeing the colour red in the sky in connection with the sun woman, Walu.“They see the sun as a woman, which is a common thread among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. They say that each morning Walu lights a small fire and she decorates herself with red ochre, and that’s why we see this red colour in the sky, whether it’s in the morning, during sunset or in eclipses. It’s an acknowledgment of this phenomena in their stories.” Where and when can I see the partial lunar eclipse?Melbourne

Special relativity could open the door to ultra-secure ATM machines.Could there be a safer way to do this? A team of researchers hailing from Canada and Switzerland are determined to find out. They  earlier this month that detailed an ultra-secure cash machine that would completely reinvent the system.""The assumption of trusting the device when you are doing anything related to identification is kind of a problem, at least at the fundamental level,"" said Sébastien Designolle, a physicist at the University of Geneva and co-author of the study.""Drop all assumptions"" is the motto he and fellow researchers abided by while coming up with a more secure mechanism to retrieve cash.Anchoring their far-fetched idea with physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, they propose replacing the PIN system with what's called a zero-knowledge proof. Here's how it works.Remember brain teasers? Zero-knowledge proofs are like a grownup version of such mind games. In cryptography, which is the study of secure communication, they're a method by which party A proves to party B that they know something. The catch is, party A, the prover, can't reveal the information they know to party B, the verifier.But there's a way for party A to get around the caveat.Suppose you have a friend named Jones who can only see in black and white, but you can see in color. Your objective is to prove to Jones you can, in fact, see color. If you were to use a zero-knowledge proof, it might go something like this:Jones holds a red card and a blue card before you. Then, behind his back, he either swaps them or doesn't swap them. Laying them out in front of you again, he asks, ""Did I swap them?""The game could be repeated a hundred times, and you'll always have the correct answer because you can see the colors. After many iterations, Jones would eventually say, ""Alright, I believe you. You can see color."" At that point, you've shown him your color-identifying ability without revealing the colors you see.""In our study,"" explained Designolle, ""the proof is the three-colorability of a graph."" Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity could get a new practical application.There's some lore behind the idea. Three-colorability is a  that theorists have studied for years. It posits the question: How can you color an enormous map of shapes with three shades such that the same colors never touch? This wouldn't be like world maps we're used to. It'd be so huge that humans need technology to comprehend it, but even with such help, Designolle said it would take years to find a three-colorability solution.Taking the concept to ATMs, he suggests giving everyone a device holding a uniquely colorized map with a preprogrammed three-colorability solution. To withdraw cash, you'd plug the device into an external outlet on the ATM, the verifier in this case. The machine would query your device, or prover, with hundreds of thousands of questions regarding sections of your map's colors. Despite the complexity of three-colorability, your device would immediately answer because it's been preprogrammed. Further, because every round of queries is randomized, even if the verifier asks about different edges, the ATM would never receive enough information to know the full map, Designolle explained, ""which is the crucial point."" Eventually, like in the situation with Jones, the ATM will verify your identity and roll out your cash because of your device's consistently correct answers -- like the way Jones said, ""Alright, I believe you. You can see color."" Ta-da.The invention seems solid -- to me, at least. But Designolle and his team aimed to drop all assumptions. They still didn't completely trust the security of the three-color map system.Hypothetically, they argue, someone could record your device's sparse answers about its map and attempt to reverse calculate the full picture, enabling them to fake your identity. ""Those functions that you can perform in one direction are very difficult, but not impossible, to compute in the other direction,"" Designolle said.For example, if you multiply two prime numbers and get a very big number, it's difficult to go back to the elementary numbers. But that doesn't bar it from being done. The same applies to three-colorability.So, how can we take these machines to a level of unconditional security? Designolle thought, well, what about invoking two devices? ""The idea behind this is precisely the same as a policeman investigating and asking two separate suspects [questions] in different rooms, so that they can't communicate,"" Designolle said. ""If they are telling the same version of the story, then it's a good hint they actually are telling the truth."" Two ATMs, two devices -- ultimate safety?Back to the cash machine. With two devices, you'd divide yourself into two provers, like the two suspects. Then, two verifiers, ATMs, will simultaneously ask its respective prover the usual three-colorability questions. Yes, you would have to plug two separate devices into two separate ATMs. At present, the researchers say the system works with the ATMs standing 60 meters (about 196 feet) apart. But they say they can get it down to a meter, or about 3 feet. It sounds overly complicated, but remember, the purpose of the experiment is to illustrate what an unconditionally secure cash machine mechanism might look like. It's theoretical -- for now, at least.If each prover appears to hold the same, incalculable knowledge, it'd be safe to say that your identity is verified. And like the criminal suspects, the devices wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. Any potential hacker would need to reverse calculate not one, but two, complex maps at the exact same time, an exceptionally challenging -- if not impossible -- task.Here's the moment you've been waiting for -- where Einstein comes in. The reason these devices wouldn't be able to communicate is they'd be bound by Einstein's theory of special relativity.Einstein's theory of special relativity beautifully marries the realms of space and time. But more importantly for Designolle's team, it also leads to constraints on how fast information travels.""With special relativity,"" Designolle said, ""it seems quite reasonable to believe in this not computational but physical assumption ... that information cannot go faster than the speed of light.""As long as the two ATMs ask their respective plugged-in, map-filled devices questions quickly enough for lags to always remain shorter than the time needed to transfer information -- restricted by the speed of light -- we'd guard against the possibility of the devices talking to each other. In a sense, the provers couldn't check their ""alibis"" to fake an identity.There's just one, final issue. These relativistic constraints aren't so airtight when it comes to nonconventional physics. Enter quantum computing.Light works differently in the quantum world. Quantum mechanics allows for a fascinating  Put simply, when two quantum particles -- namely, light particles -- are entangled, they can instantaneously communicate. It's not even a matter of how fast the information travels. It's immediate. If particle A holds knowledge of something, you can be absolutely sure particle B already knows it too.IBM's quantum computer""Suppose that I do not have the coloring of a graph, but I want to pretend that I do,"" Designolle said, referring to a potential hacker. ""I could come up with a procedure using quantum entanglement between the two chips to answer the questions correctly. In a way, I can cheat.""While Designolle's team believes their mechanism should be able to guarantee safety from quantum hackers, they're not sure. However, they're currently pondering whether the protocol could itself use quantum provers instead of standard devices.And if you've gotten this far, you might be wondering exactly how theoretical these ultra-secure ATMs are. Is it even possible to bring them into reality? Right now, Designolle said, the main issue is cost. In order to create the devices needed for the mechanism, the chips can't be the same type we find on our debit cards today. They will have to be extremely powerful, which means they'll likely be very expensive. One idea he has is to invoke the system for large companies that trade secure information and can afford the pricey chips.That would actually make the relativistic constraints looser because there would be a greater distance between each party's device and the verifying ""cash machine,"" so light would take longer to travel. This means there'd be more room for lags before hackers can penetrate the system.But aside from the realistic applications, Designolle said, ""On a personal note, it was really interesting just to see that sometimes something very simple is actually hard to come up with. ... At some point, yes, this occurred, but it was not very clear from the beginning that it would be so simple in the end.""",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/n9wrFzFFwe8cmyu1HnCs_FzK7jg=/84x84/2021/08/24/e76aa36e-1c55-45d9-949f-a3db6dd0eb70/monisha-ravisetti.jpg,"No US return to the moon before 2026: government audit - Global Times

"‘Battlefield 2042’ bullet spread is already being changed - NME.com
A good excuse for missing those headshotsDeveloper EA Dice has said that Battlefield 2042’s bullet spread is already receiving attention with changes planned.Battlefield 2042 is available now for those who purchased the gold or ultimate editions of the game, or those jumping in for a trial through EA’s subscription service EA Play. However, players have noticed a problem with some of the weapons.Players have found that weapons in Battlefield 2042 will sometimes miss the centre of a reticule. This is sometimes called “bloom”, where a bullet will land within an area near the centre of a crosshair, but not always precisely where it is aimed. Developers use this system to introduce inaccuracy for weapons that might be too powerful at specific ranges. However, many fans say there are better ways to balance weapons.One player tweeted about the issue and tagged a member of EA Dice (via Charlie Intel). The initial tweet said, “Agreed. Way too much spread on guns at the moment, I want shots to hit where I’m aiming. I’d love the know the design decisions that went into these changes…”Thanks for the tag, we're looking at weapons already and are planning on a few changes regarding spread. Not date or specifics to share for the changes yet though.— Florian – DRUNKKZ3 (@DRUNKKZ3) November 12, 2021The Battlefield 2042 lead game designer, Florian Le Bihan, responded saying, “Thanks for the tag, we’re looking at weapons already and are planning on a few changes regarding spread. Not date or specifics to share for the changes yet though.”Several clips have been shared to the Battlefield 2042 subreddit showing clips of rounds missing targets, despite the crosshair being placed clearly on a player. It’s worth noting that this does not affect sniper rifles. saying the feature “doesn’t feel very good” and adding that it “rewards worse players”.

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.A divisive draft law to enshrine religious freedom has been scaled back to prevent a backlash over a so-called “Folau clause” that sought to give people more right to offend others when making claims on the basis of their faith.The federal government has removed a key part of a draft religious freedom bill that would have created new protections for outspoken remarks, but the revised bill retains other safeguards for “statements of belief” after years of campaigning by church groups.Attorney-General Michaelia Cash has been working on religious discrimination legislation.Credit:Alex EllinghausenThe changes weaken but do not strike out a series of measures that were meant to protect people such as footballer Israel Folau after Rugby Australia terminated his contract in 2019 over a social media post claiming homosexuals, adulterers, atheists and other “sinners” would go to hell.A separate section of the draft bill that gave medical professionals the right to deny services to patients on the grounds of “conscientious objection” has been removed entirely after complaints from health experts about the implications for abortion, contraception and broader healthcare.But the draft bill retains a provision that gives religious institutions the right to pro-actively discriminate when hiring staff, a protection sought by private schools that believe personal faith should be a factor in hiring teachers.Attorney-General Michaelia Cash made the drastic changes to the Religious Discrimination Bill after years of dispute over the scale of the protections, with church leaders arguing for stronger measures while mental health experts, LGBTI groups and medical professionals warned against the changes.Australian Christian Lobby boss Martyn Iles boasted last month that the federal government  in the bill, which is .The government has been working on the changes for more than two years but has been unable to get an agreement between conservative Liberals and Nationals who want stronger protections and moderate Liberals who argued the changes went too far.Coalition MPs on the backbench legal affairs committee were given a five-page briefing note at a meeting on Monday that set out significant changes to the most recent version of the bill, known as the second exposure draft.The note revealed that a provision on employer conduct rules had been removed from the draft, scrapping a key section that would prevent employers acting against someone who spoke out in the same way as Mr Folau.However, the note made it clear that terminating a contract might still be unlawful under other sections of the bill relating to direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of faith.The revised bill also retains a separate provision that would make it unlawful for a qualifying body to sanction someone for making offensive remarks.In its new form, the Religious Discrimination Bill would allow an employer to terminate the contract of someone such as Mr Folau but would prevent a qualifying body, in fields as diverse as accounting or medicine, from removing that person’s right to work for other employers.The bill does not change protections in other laws such as those Mr Folau cited when challenging his termination under the Fair Work Act.Two people in the meeting, Liberal backbencher Katie Allen and Liberal National Party MP George Christensen, spoke up to see the bill itself, rather than the briefing note, before they are expected to decide their position on the changes when Parliament returns next week.“It is so typical of the ramshackle way Michaelia Cash has conducted the whole thing,” said one Liberal who was seeking more clarity about the changes.The government’s reluctance to reveal the revised draft to its own backbenchers is unusual when the standard process is to give a backbench committee access to draft laws before the full Coalition party room meets on Tuesdays when Parliament is sitting to approve legislation.“It would be very odd for them to go to the party room on Tuesday asking us to support a bill we haven’t seen,” said one MP.A swift decision on the final law is unlikely because Senator Cash would normally introduce the bill to the Senate in the expectation it would go to an inquiry before a vote in the upper house that might amend the government draft before any decision by the House of Representatives.With only two sitting weeks left before Parliament rises for its summer break, the Religious Discrimination Bill is not expected to become law this year and may not be enacted before the federal election.Church groups such as the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference and the Seventh Day Adventist Church backed the draft bill for its provisions on statements of religious belief as well as its protections for people of faith who work in education or healthcare.But the Australian Medical Association and other peak health groups warned against the part of the bill that introduced new federal protections for doctors and others who chose to deny treatments or healthcare to people on religious grounds.The peak health groups argued that professional standards and state law already set rules that allowed a certain amount of conscientious objection from medical practitioners while ensuring patients were given proper care.A key issue was the call from health groups to make sure medical practitioners told patients of their religious beliefs if this was a factor in their care and then made sure patients were referred to another practitioner who could look after them.The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians all objected to the draft bill in its earlier form.Fascinating answers to perplexing questions delivered to your inbox every week. .

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.A mother and daughter who imported Malaysian tea into Australia spent four months in jail after the substance was wrongly identified as an amphetamine - even after NSW Police became aware of problems with the drug test.Vun Pui “Connie” Chong and her daughter, San Yan Melanie Lim, sought to import into Australia 25 kilograms of brown ginger tea, a well-known remedy for period pain in Malaysia. It arrived in five rectangular boxes, each containing 24 individually wrapped packets of tea, which the women were planning to sell with a mark-up that would have netted them a $90 profit.Connie Chong advertised the tea that she imported from Malaysia on social media.Credit:InstagramBut Australian Border Force officials intercepted the product at Sydney Airport on January 17 and identified it as Phenmetrazine. Bankstown police confiscated the contents and replaced them with an inert substance, which was delivered to the women’s Greenacre home and then seized when they raided it a day later.The women were charged with commercial drug supply, which attracts a lifetime prison sentence, and refused bail.However, the Downing Local Court heard on Tuesday that the presumptive test used by the ABF to identify the shipment as a prohibited substance merely generated a spectrum of similar substances to the one detected, and the Australian Federal Police did not rely upon it to conduct investigations.A forensic operator from the AFP wrote to Bankstown Detective Senior Constable Tara Conaghan in February, advising that she would need to have the sample tested independently to be certain that it contained Phenmetrazine.“Mate in a nutshell we cannot take from this ABF result that the sample contains or does not contain Phenmetrazine,” he wrote. The ABF “hazmat” test had only identified Phenmetrazine as the fourth most likely substance contained in the seized shipment, behind sugar, sucrose and powdered sugar, he said.The court heard that Detective Conaghan did not pass this information onto the women’s defence team, and they remained behind bars.Then, in April, another AFP officer emailed Detective Conaghan to let her know that laboratory results from two earlier seizures of similar products had determined that there were “no prohibited substances detected”. The AFP had also done its own forensics and could not extract any prohibited substances.“Our forensics are engaging with the ABF over their testing,” the officer wrote. “They advise it’s a training issue with the ABF on how they interpreted the results.”Under cross-examination by Ms Chong’s barrister, Steve Boland, Detective Conaghan said that after she learned from the AFP that their analysis of earlier seizures did not detect prohibited substances, she asked for forensic testing of the samples related to Ms Lim and Ms Chong to be expedited.Mr Boland: “What did you do about disclosing that information to the two people who you had accused of drug importation?Det Conaghan: “I didn’t inform the ... Do you mean Ms Lim and Ms Chong?”“The people who were in jail.”“I didn’t inform them” - Why not? “Because the drugs were still waiting to be completely tested.” - So, what, they’ve got to sit it out in jail?There was a silence.Mr Boland: “I’ll assume that question is not going to be answered.”The women were not bailed until May, and it was not until 10 August, after the NSW Police received their own forensic analysis, that the charges against them were withdrawn.They are now suing for costs, which the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has refused to pay.Mr Boland told the court that it had never been conveyed to the women or their legal representatives that there were questions over the veracity of the hazmat test.“The Crown is opposing the idea that these falsely accused women should get a dollar,” Mr Boland said.The case, before Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson, was adjourned to March.The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.
