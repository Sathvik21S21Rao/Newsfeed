"Live updates: Matildas vs Brazil, scores, stats and commentary from Parramatta Stadium - ABC News
A stunning tackle from Yallop on Tamires in the penalty area leads to shouts of a penalty, but it was a well-timed tackle after Fowler was caught out of position.The Matildas clear their lines but the ball just comes back, this time Kerolin hitting the side netting.Adriana comes back inside and has another shot from long range.Looked initially like there was a deflection, but it just appeared that she sliced the ball badly wide.Another opportunity though.Another one! This time it's Kerolin making a run down the right, shimmying with a step over or two and then firing a shot at the near post that Williams does well to stop at the near post.The Matildas hanging on a little bit here.A couple of them in truth!Marta gets the latest after a previous shot from Adriana pin-balls around the area and lands at the legendary striker's feet, but Williams makes the save.Williams was beaten by a lovely shot from Adriana, who skipped inside off her wing and fired a low shot against the foot of the post, only to see the ball roll across the goalline and not into the back of the net!Poor ball from Mary Fowler is picked off by Marta, who plays in Debinha, whose shot flies well over the bar.As brilliant as Fowler is on the ball, she has been caught out a couple of times defensively and, in situations where she is in possession in her own defensive third, can still make the wrong decisions...It didn't cost Australia then, but it could have. A clear warning shot.This game is ridiculously end-to-end!The Matildas clear at their end of the field after another dangerous run from left back Tamires, only to release Sam Kerr up the other end, with the Chelsea striker bursting towards the edge of the penalty area where her shot is blocked.ALM speaks the truth.Clare Polkinghorne doing it at both ends of the field, heading the ball off the line after a cross from Tamires just drifts dangerously over the head of Williams.Clare 'prolific' Polkinghorne opens the scoring! Brisbane's best footballer BAR NONE has opened the scoring in a second successive match, steering the ball home at the back post with a nicely cushioned effort after the defence can't clear the corner. Carpenter and Fowler linking up on the right is what I am here for, and they did link up brilliantly there to release Kerr down the right, her early ball found Foord, whose shot was saved well by the foot of the keeper.Oh my that's a brilliant opportunity for Foord!Carpenter got in behind the Brazilian defence down the right after a neat through-ball by Yallop and played in a delightful teasing cross to the edge of the six-yard box but Foord just scooped the ball over the bar!Wow, you've got to score those...Sam Kerr gets some space down the right, it was a hell of a ball to find her, but she has to wait for support and her cross is, in the end, well dealt with by the Brazil defence.Tamires is getting forward from right back and that's left that gap for Kerr to exploit.The field opened up for Adriana in midfield, and she unleashes with a powerful shot that's blocked on the edge of the penalty area.Brazil have certainly started the brighter of the two teams, but no clear cut chances, yet.We're underway in Parramatta!Brazil in the blue shirts, white shorts kicking from right to left, Matildas in the Australian gold shirts and socks with green shorts.Mary Fowler appears to be taking up position on the right side early on to accommodate Emily van Egmond's inclusion.They made lots of noise in the first game, looks like we're going to have a repeat performance in the stands on this Tuesday night as well.The teams are out, so we have a pre-recorded Welcome to Country in recognition of the traditional custodians of the Darug country, the Burramattagal people.Now it's the anthems.If you missed out on Saturday's match, well, you missed a good one, in which the Matildas shrugged off  and a pretty ordinary one on it () with an emphatic 3-1 victory.Even Clare Polkinghorne, Brisbane's greatest footballing product (don't @ me, you know I'm right), got on the scoresheet, along with the stunningly talented Mary Fowler and Emily van Egmond.Anyway, if you wanted a more in-depth analysis than just how good Polks is, .We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.This service may include material from Agence France-Presse (AFP), APTN, Reuters, AAP, CNN and the BBC World Service which is  and cannot be reproduced.AEST = Australian Eastern Standard Time which is 10 hours ahead of GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)",https://images.scribblelive.com/2021/10/26/bfc18254-5fd6-4a4a-93c5-98ae01be3eec.jpg,"Wallabies lose Samu Kerevi and Sean McMahon for tour of United Kingdom - Wide World of Sports

When Manchester United's  at Old Trafford was complete on Monday morning (AEDT), one block of loyal fans stayed behind, bellowing the manager's name as they stood arm in arm.There was just one problem - it was the travelling away supporters.There couldn't be a more perfect metaphor for the canary in the coalmine than the one that came in the form of a couple thousand Liverpool fans, co-opting and ironically chanting their support for a manager whose time seems well and truly up.Solksjaer is in a unique spot - he seems to be constantly backed, or at least not criticised as heavily as others would be, by pundits on English television, while simultaneously being ripped to shreds by those who once sang his name from the stands.READ MORE: READ MORE: Gary Neville is one of the most respected voices in English football, but he's also someone who has a long-time friendship with Solskjaer - and despite repeated criticisms of the tactical setup, refuses to suggest that the club needs to move on.Another member of United's 1990s powerhouse sides, Paul Scholes, harangued Solskjaer for his tactics but focused most of his attention on midfielder and perennial easy target Paul Pogba.You can argue if Solskjaer is the right man for the job.

Rightly or wrongly, there are many on both sides of the camera who incorrectly conflate making tough personnel decisions with spitefulness and negativity.Much like calling for a player to be dropped due to poor performance is often seen as a personal attack towards the person in question, the idea that a coach should be relieved of their duties causes some people to bristle at the notion of 'talking about another man's job'.If Solksjaer isn't good enough for the job, and the tepid football played by one of the most expensive squads in the world is evidence of that, then it should be a relatively straight-forward decision.Sacking club legends is often difficult - in Australia, the Roosters cut ties with Brad Fittler after a dreadful 2009 season.

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.The maker of the Model 3 sedan – the top-selling electric car worldwide – is now the second fastest company ever to reach this mark, taking just over 11 years since its public debut in June 2010. Facebook did it faster, although its market capitalisation is now below $US1 trillion as the stock has sold off over the past two months. The other US-listed members of the trillion-dollar club include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.com.Tesla has made Elon Musk the world’s richest person.Credit:APTesla shares rose as much as 9.8 per cent Monday on news of the Hertz order, briefly pushing its market value past $US1 trillion. It’s a key milestone for the carmaker whose shares have been on a tear amid a global shift to electric vehicles. About two-thirds of founder Elon Musk’s net worth is tied directly to shares and options in the electric-car company, of which he is co-founder and chief executive officer.Musk’s personal fortune jumped by almost $US36 billion ($48 billion) to $US289 billion as filings showed a fresh tranche of options in his moonshot pay package vested.It is the biggest one-day gain in the history of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, topping Chinese tycoon Zhong Shanshan’s $US32 billion surge last year on the day his bottled-water company, Nongfu Spring Co, went public. Among others, Musk’s soaring net worth now makes him more valuable than Exxon Mobil.Musk is increasingly pulling away from his fellow mega-billionaires when it comes to the size of his fortune. Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos ranks second with $US193 billion, according to the Bloomberg index.Even before the Hertz deal, Tesla shares have climbed in recent weeks. The auto maker’s stock price is up more 40 per cent this year, almost double the gain of the S&P 500 Index, as investors continue to reward green technologies.A surge in Tesla stock isn’t the only source of wealth gains for Musk. The seventh tranche of Musk’s massive 2018 stock option package vested in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Monday, adding about $US8 billion to his net worth.Tesla’s addition to the coterie of megacap technology names comes as the automotive industry is on the cusp of a massive transformation, with electric vehicles expected to take the place of gas-driven cars globally. The company and its charismatic and often controversial co-founder are seen as one of the main driving forces behind this shift.Tesla is now the second fastest company ever to reach the $US1 trillion mark, behind only Facebook, taking just over 11 years since its public debut.Credit:BloombergThe company’s shares have been on a streak over the past five months, climbing more than 75 per cent since mid-May. However, the rally got a big boost this month amid a flurry of encouraging headlines: strong third-quarter earnings and deliveries, the Hertz order and a report that the company’s Model 3 was the top-selling vehicle in Europe last month.“Tesla is the leader in EV manufacturing, batteries and autonomy,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note on Monday. “Tesla also has a suite of enabling technologies and other businesses that would allow the company to be an auto and energy champion in the long run.”The push toward electrifying all modes of transportation – especially cars, trucks, buses and vans – has rapidly intensified this year, with governments pledging to find solutions for the climate-change crisis. Countries across the world have announced policies to lower carbon emissions and incentivise corporations to move toward greener technologies. The entire electric-vehicle ecosystem – including carmakers, battery developers and charging-network operators – has been climbing as a result.“The outlook for EV adoption is getting much brighter, due to a combination of more policy support, further improvements in battery density and cost, more charging infrastructure being built, and rising commitments from automakers,” Bloomberg New Energy Finance noted in a September report. BNEF estimated that passenger EV sales will increase sharply in the next few years, reaching 14 million in 2025 compared with 3.1 million in 2020.The Hertz deal comes on the back of a flurry of encouraging developments at Tesla.Credit:BloombergYet, some say those bright and shiny growth numbers still do not fully justify Tesla’s mammoth size. It is not only the biggest automaker in the world, its market capitalisation is significantly bigger than all of the top car companies taken together. However, Tesla still manufactures only a fraction of the number of cars that some of these companies, like General Motors, produce.“We acknowledge Tesla is executing impeccably, but this does not alter our view Tesla is egregiously overvalued,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin wrote in a note on October 21, saying that the company’s current valuation appears to rest on the “specious assumption that the hundreds of EVs slated for launch by 2025 will all be flops.”Competition is indeed building up. After being on the sidelines for years, with mostly hybrid or just a few electric cars in their lineup, almost all major legacy auto companies this year have announced aggressive plans for making EVs and developing the required ecosystem that includes batteries and charging-station networks.Bullish investors and analysts, on the other hand, say Tesla should not be compared to its auto peers at all. It is more like a technology company, they argue, and is correctly valued accordingly.Tesla shares currently trade at 172 times their estimated 2021 earnings, compared to 34 times for the NYSE+ FANG Index, whose other nine members include Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, Twitter , Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix, Alibaba Group and Baidu.BloombergThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.212%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/4d65857bf55e650cae0e764b08106e5fb82a357c,"Victoria records 1,510 new local COVID-19 cases and four deaths - ABC

SYDNEY, Oct. 26 (Xinhua) -- Researchers from the University of Queensland have discovered a new orally-administered vaccine to prevent hookworm infection, a parasite which has caused millions of deaths globally.The report, released to the public on Tuesday, showed initial trials of the vaccine were twice as effective as existing treatment methods.Professor Istvan Toth from University of Queensland's School of Chemistry and Molecular Biology said the main draw point of the vaccine would be the fact that it can be delivered as a tablet, liquid or powder, meaning it could easily be distributed to developing countries.""Our vaccine candidate can be orally self-administered, bypassing the need for trained medical staff, and means there's no requirement for special storage, enabling it to reach large, isolated populations,"" said Toth.It is estimated that around half a billion people worldwide are infected with some form of hookworm parasite, primarily people living in tropical and subtropical areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, China and East Asia.Its harm is exacerbated in developing nations where water quality, sanitation and hygiene are lowest.Research from Stanford University estimated that the disease is responsible for 65,000 deaths every year, but the brunt of its impact is in its stunting of children's development and instances of miscarriage in women.Initial trials of the new vaccine being developed by UQ showed a 94 percent reduction in worm levels in mice, compared with 30 to 50 percent reduction delivered in current treatments.""Our vaccine produces antibodies against the hookworm enzymes responsible for the digestion of blood - they simply stop being able to eat properly,"" said co-author on the paper Dr Mariusz Skwarczynski.Dr. Toth told Xinhua that while the vaccine's development has not been a priority due to COVID-19, he and his team hopes to move to human trials as soon as possible.He said that once on the market, the vaccine's compound is likely to be one of the cheapest and most accessible treatments available.

Physicists looking for signs of primordial gravitational waves by sifting through the earliest light in the cosmos – the cosmic microwave background (CMB) – have reported their findings: still nothing.But far from being a dud, the latest results from the BICEP3 experiment at the South Pole have tightened the bounds on models of cosmic inflation, a process that in theory explains several perplexing features of our universe and which should have produced gravitational waves shortly after the universe began.“Once-promising models of inflation are now ruled out,” said Chao-Lin Kuo, a BICEP3 principal investigator and a physicist at Stanford University and the Department of Energy’s SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.The results were published Oct. 4 in Physical Review Letters.Cosmic inflation is the idea that very early in the history of the universe, the amount of space in the universe exploded from roughly the size of a hydrogen atom to about a light-year across, in about the time it would take light to travel one-trillionth of the way across the same atom.Inflation can explain a lot – notably, why the universe appears to be fairly smooth and look the same in all directions, why space is flat and why there are no magnetic monopoles. Still, physicists have not succeeded in working out the exact details, and they have come up with many different ways inflation might have occurred.One way to sort out which, if any, of these inflationary models is correct is to look for gravitational waves that would have been produced as space expanded and the matter and energy in it shifted. In particular, those waves should leave an imprint on the polarization of light in the cosmic microwave background.This polarized light has two components: B-modes, which swirl around the sky, and E-modes, which are arranged in more orderly lines. Although the details depend on which model of inflation is correct, primordial gravitational waves should show up as particular patterns of B and E modes.Starting in the mid-2000s, researchers began studying B-mode polarization in the CMB, searching for evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Over time, the particulars of the experiments have changed considerably, says SLAC lead scientist Zeeshan Ahmed, who has worked on a few incarnations of the BICEP experiment at the South Pole.The first BICEP experiment deployed about 50 machined metal horns that detect tiny differences in microwave radiation, each equipped with thermal sensors and polarizing grids to measure polarization. The next generation, BICEP2, required a technological leap – new, superconducting detectors that could be more densely packed into the same area as previous telescopes. The successor Keck Array was essentially several BICEP2 telescopes in one.To get to the next level, BICEP3, “we had to invent some things along the way,” Ahmed says.With support from a SLAC Laboratory Directed Research and Development grant, Kuo, Ahmed and other SLAC scientists developed a number of new systems and materials. Among those are detector components that are more modular and easier to replace and lenses and filters that are more transparent to microwaves while blocking more infrared light, which helps keep the temperature-sensitive superconducting microwave detectors cool.Those advances, Ahmed says, combined with data from prior experiments including BICEP2, Keck, WMAP and Planck, have allowed researchers to put the tightest bounds yet on what kinds of primordial gravitational waves could be out there – and hence the tightest bounds yet on models of cosmic inflation.“The experimentalists are doing heroic work,” says Stanford theoretical physicist Eva Silverstein, who studies cosmic inflation. “It’s great progress.”The results rule out a number of inflation models, including some popular older models and some versions of newer ones motivated by string theory, says Silverstein. The findings suggest that the correct model will be slightly more complicated that those that have been ruled out, although there is still a wide range of viable alternatives. “It’s not as though we’re going back to the drawing board,” Silverstein says, but the results “help us focus.”As more data comes in from BICEP3 and its immediate successor, the BICEP Array, as well as from other projects, physicists will start to get clues that will help focus their search for better models of inflation even more. Still, Ahmed says, they may have to wait until CMB-S4, a project currently under review at the Department of Energy, to get clearer answers. CMB-S4 will deploy the equivalent of 18 BICEP3 experiments – or more, Ahmed says – and will draw heavily on Department of Energy laboratory researchers and expertise, including ideas developed for BICEP3. “It’ll take a decade to build up this thing,” he says, “but it’s starting to take shape.”The BICEP project is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, the Keck Foundation, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the U.K. Science and Technology Facilities Council and the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.Citation: P.A.R.

Say hello to 2M0437b, one of the youngest planets ever found whose existence has finally been confirmed by astronomers. Orbiting a young red dwarf star just 400 light-years from our Solar System, it’s taken astronomers three years of observations to confirm the existence of, and now directly image, the bigger-than-Jupiter planet 2M0437b. It could help astronomers learn how planets form and change with time. Here’s the incredible image, which took three years to create: In this image—taken using the Subaru Telescope on Maunakea in Hawaii—the brighter host star, 2M0437, has been removed, which allows the planet 2M0437b to show-up (the four spikes of light are artifacts produced by the telescope’s optics).“This serendipitous discovery adds to an elite list of planets that we can directly observe with our telescopes,” said lead author Eric Gaidos, a professor in the University of Hawaii Mānoa Department of Earth Sciences. “By analyzing the light from this planet we can say something about its composition, and perhaps where and how it formed in a long-vanished disk of gas and dust around its host star.”The research is due to be published soon in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and is now . “The exquisite data from the Keck Observatory allowed us to confirm that the faint neighbor is moving through space along with its star, and thus is a true companion,” said Dr. Adam Kraus, a professor in the Department of Astronomy at the University if Texas at Austin and co-author on the paper. The planet 2M0437b is about 400 light-years from us and lies about 100 times the Earth-Sun distance from its parent star. That huge distance makes it easier than usual to observe. 2M0437b is a few times more massive than Jupiter and thought to have formed several million years ago. It’s so young that it’s still hot from the energy released during its formation.The host star is an “M-type” or red dwarf in a star-forming region of the Milky Way galaxy called the Taurus Cloud. Although you can’t see the small star with the naked eye, it’s north of bright star Aldebaran and east of the Pleiades open cluster of stars. “Eventually, we might even be able to measure its orbital motion around the star,” said Kraus.The scientists used the W. M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea to monitor the position of the host star as it moved across the sky. They made use of Keck Observatory’s second-generation Near-Infrared Camera (NIRC2) in combination with the Keck II telescope’s adaptive optics (AO) system. Although the observations required three years because the star moves slowly across the sky, the researchers were able to confirm that 2M0437b was a companion to the star rather than a more distant object. The key telescope technology that allowed them to do that—and which allows ground-based telescopes to find objects like 2M0437b—is AO.AO is able to correct for the distortion caused by Earth’s turbulent atmosphere. That’s important because all of that hot, moving air makes stars appear to twinkle and blur.AO uses computers to slightly deform the telescope’s mirrors, thereby correcting for any distortion. It works by using a bright star as a control (guide star or NGS), with the system monitoring how much it’s blurred and distorted. When there are no bright stars lasers can be used to artificially create a point of light (laser guide star adaptive optics or LGS AO). “Two of the world’s largest telescopes, adaptive optics technology, and Maunakea’s clear skies were all needed to make this discovery,” said co-author Michael Liu, an astronomer at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa Institute for Astronomy (IfA). It’s hoped that more data can be gathered about 2M0437b, not just by other ground-based telescopes, but by space telescopes in orbit. “Observations with space telescopes such as NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope and the soon-to-be-launched  could identify gases in its atmosphere and reveal whether the planet has a moon-forming disk,” said Gaidos.Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes.I'm an experienced science, technology and travel journalist and stargazer writing about exploring the night sky, solar and lunar eclipses, moon-gazing, astro-travel,I'm an experienced science, technology and travel journalist and stargazer writing about exploring the night sky, solar and lunar eclipses, moon-gazing, astro-travel, astronomy and space exploration.

"‘Halo Infinite’ Campaign Reveal Do-Over Shows Master Chief Map Clearing - Forbes
Halo Infinite just launched a  than what we saw a year ago, with the disastrous reveal that got the game delayed a full year. No memes are likely to emerge from this one, as it was certainly much improved, and formatted completely differently.This was a six and a half minute narrated, edited video, showing a mix of cutscenes and in-game action with Master Chief doing cool grappling hook tricks and blowing up Banished bases all over his new open map.The open world format has dramatically changed the structure of this campaign, and Halo Infinite has everything from Borderlands-like Catch-A-Ride stations where you can spawn a garage full of vehicles, and Just Cause-like outpost takeovers where you’re meant to blow up something large and explosive to cripple enemy forces. There’s a lot of emphasis on taking down the Banished “one piece at a time.”I’m not entirely clear how “real” campaign missions will be woven into the open world story, though those do exist with scripted moments like Master Chief facing new Covenant and Forerunner threats, in addition to the Banished. The ultimate goal of the game is to find what happened to Cortana, and you’re aided by a new spritely AI named “The Weapon” (odd name, given her personality, but perhaps she has hidden depths) and that one bearded guy we’ve seen from the start who apparently is in charge of flying your ship around to different points on the map.It remains fundamentally weird to me that Halo is switching to an open world, take-over-the-outposts format that feels like an offshoot of an Ubisoft game. Not to say it can’t work, but it is a pretty dramatic departure from the entire history of the series, and it has already cost them co-op, which isn’t coming for a full season. However, it’s easy to see how Halo evolves from here, as Infinite is meant to be a “platform” for future Halo content. So instead of a full sequel, maybe we get a mega-expansion in a year or two that adds a new open world zone to the existing map. A bit like Destiny, in that sense. That hasn’t been stated outright yet, but it’s clearly possible.As for the actual gameplay, it did look better than the first reveal, that’s for sure, but it was also edited to be as exciting as possible, so who knows. I enjoy Master Chief storming these bases without any regard for stealth like we’d see in say, Far Cry, and again, between the explosions, the vehicles and the grappling hook, I very much am getting Just Cause vibes here, a game I never imagined might cross over with Halo in any sense.So, I don’t know if I was blown away by anything shown here, but unlike last time, I don’t see a bunch of red flags springing up either, and I’m certainly curious to try out this new format. We’ll see how it goes in just over a month now.Pick up my sci-fi novels the Herokiller series and its audiobook, and The Earthborn Trilogy, also on audiobook.I’ve been writing about video games, television and movies for Forbes for over 10 years, and you may have seen my reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Google’s Pixel smartphones have always leant on AI tricks to overcome hardware weaknesses, utilising complex algorithms and cloud processing rather than raw power.But this year, with the Pixel 6, the company’s built a device with brains and brawn. With all new camera hardware, a custom processor for more capable on-device (rather than cloud-based) AI capabilities and a fun, confident aesthetic in both build and software, these machines measure up to Apple’s 2021 iPhones in almost every way while coming in significantly cheaper.The Pixel 6 Pro (left) and standard Pixel 6 are practically the same size, but the former packs a much larger display.The standard Pixel 6 is bigger, prettier, more powerful and has far superior cameras compared to last year’s Pixel 5, but sticks to the same price of $999. It also has a bigger, smoother display than the equivalent iPhone 13, takes nicer pictures in many scenarios and comes in at $350 less.I really like the Pixel 6’s unusual glossy two-tone body, broken up by a chunky horizontal camera bar. It has a completely flat 6.1-inch display and a satiny frame that looks great with Google’s new botanical wallpaper themes.Meanwhile the $1299 Pixel 6 Pro (which is $400 or $550 less than the iPhone depending on whether you compare it to the 13 Pro or 13 Pro Max), is essentially the same physical size as the regular Pixel 6, but with smaller bezels and a curved design that allows for a bigger 6.7-inch display. It looks a bit ritzier, but maybe not quite as fun, with a thin polished metal frame.Both phones are powered by Google’s own Tensor processor, have beautiful AMOLED screens with fast refresh rates (90Hz on Pixel 6 and up to 120Hz on the Pro), IP68 waterproofing, 30W fast charging and 128GB of storage. They have enough grunt to handle any game or app I threw at them, excellent (but not industry-leading) battery life, and they also both support 5G, with the Pro being the first Australian phone to support the mmWave variety (not that it’ll be much good to you right now).Photography has always been a strength of Google’s phones, but refreshed hardware means they’re once again at the very top at the pile with Pixel 6. There’s a new 50MP main shooter with a large sensor, plus a 12MP ultrawide, with the Pro adding a periscope telephoto at 4x optical zoom. Shots are always sharp and well exposed, low light photos and selective blur for portraits are both the best you can get anywhere, and video — which was previously a weak spot — is slick, stable and perfectly clear at Full HD or 4K.New on the Pixel 6 are motion photo modes “action pan” and “long exposure”, which will blur parts of the picture while keeping others perfectly in focus, which can have a very dramatic effect.The selfie camera, which lives in a hole punch rather than a notch, is also very capable this time and can utilise any of the tools the rear shooters can. The Pro gets a slightly nicer unit, able to handle ultrawide selfies and 4K video.Google’s AI is generally running unseen in the background, but anytime I fed the Pixel a tricky photo (say a 10x digital zoom with a lot of detail, or a low light image of a person with dark skin), the Pixel exceeded expectations. I also love how logical and accessible the various modes and options are in the Pixel’s camera app, rather than relying on “pro” modes or hidden menus.With the Tensor ship enabling greater AI capabilities in real time, photos also get a few new tricks you can apply after the fact. “Magic eraser” can wipe objects or people from your shots, intelligently filling in the blank space so it appears they were never there. It works great with people in the background messing up your composition and, while there are sometimes artefacts left where the people used to be, you wouldn’t notice unless you knew to look for it.The Pixel 6’s bold look works well with software that can dynamically change the colour of widgets, icons and other UI elements.There’s also “Face unblur”, which can analyse a pic of your fast-moving kid and restore a sharp image of their face. It doesn’t work every time, but it is impressive. And since all my shots are backed up on Google Photos, I can apply either of these new tools (or add portrait blur, or denoise, or any of a raft of AI processes) to photos I took a decade ago with non-Pixel phones.And AI capabilities, of course, extend to the rest of the phone. Using your voice to type is faster and far more accurate here than on any other phone I’ve used, while Pixel 6 also supports translating incoming and outgoing text messages (in various apps) on the fly so you can converse more naturally with foreign friends. Smart services like app suggestions, an enhanced At a Glance widget and the Google Assistant are customisable to be exactly as present as you’d like, which is ideal.Obviously the Pixel 6 will be most helpful for people deep in the Google ecosystem. I like that Google Pay cards and Google Home smart devices are accessible directly from the phone’s lockscreen for example. And the company’s own apps can be set so their icons change along with your custom palette choices, which can make for a very slick or very uneven home screen depending on how many of your favourite services come from Google.Android 12 itself represents a bit of a facelift to make things bubblier and more accessible, but also hides some serious improvements like new controls to lock down apps’ access to your camera and microphone, smarter auto-rotate, better search bar. And while Google’s automatic colour customisation for widgets and UI might seem like a silly addition, it works with the hardware design and extremely smooth animation of the displays to make for much more pleasant and cohesive navigation than most Androids.Get news and reviews on technology, gadgets and gaming in our Technology newsletter every Friday.

Audi is all in on electrification, but it still knows how to make an honest-to-God performance car powered solely by a good ol' combustion engine. We're not talking about the mighty R8 supercar with its naturally aspirated V10, although this new RS3 is just about as quick to 62 mph (100 km/h) as Audi Sport's flagship vehicle. Yes, a compact model with half the number of cylinders can almost match a fully fledged, mid-engined supercar.Our long-time friend Auditography was given the chance to not only immortalize the 2022 RS3 Sedan, but also put its 2.5-liter turbocharged engine through its paces in an acceleration test. The Four Rings may say the car needs 3.8 seconds to hit 62 mph (100 km/h) from a standstill, but as you can see in the video shot in beautiful Greece, the all-wheel-drive speed machine is much quicker.3.1 seconds – that's all it took for this Python Yellow RS3 to complete the sprint, shaving off 0.7 seconds compared to the official time. German luxury brands are known to deliberately underestimate the capabilities of their performance cars, but we weren't expecting such a big difference between the quoted and real-life acceleration numbers.Of course, performance isn't all about straight-line acceleration, but with torque vectoring and a drift mode, the RS3 is shaping up to be a real hoot even when you're not putting the pedal to the metal on the Autobahn. Even though it's based on a front-wheel-drive platform, the hot compact sedan is tail-happy provided you activate the standard RS Torque Rear – the official name for drift mode.The latest RS3 also happens to be the fastest production car in the compact class to lap the Nürburgring, made possible partially thanks to its RS Torque Splitter to counteract the understeer typically associated with powerful FWD cars. With a generous 401 hp and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) on tap, the smallest RS model from Audi Sport certainly needed its clever Quattro system to efficiently channel all that power to the wheels.Spy shots have revealed archrival AMG A45/CLA 45 is  and it will be interesting to see whether Mercedes will find a way to respond to Audi's latest compact rocket.

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.On an island about 1400 kilometres away from Queensland lies a small community where months of uncertainty over the education system had left only nine teachers committed to stay to support 300 students.Doubts had lingered over the Norfolk Island’s future of schooling, once NSW ended its commitment to providing crucial services.Queensland has agreed to provide state services to Norfolk Island.“Nine teachers out of 35 have committed to staying regardless of what happens,” Norfolk Island teacher Susie Hale said last week.“The others have either already taken jobs in NSW or are in an ambivalent zone to wait and see.”But the waiting ended on Tuesday, with an intergovernmental agreement for Queensland to take the reins and provide state services to the island.Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said the deal was a landmark moment for Norfolk Island.Children at Norfolk Island Central School, where the Queensland government has agreed to provide educational support.Credit:Facebook/Norfolk Island Central School“With the signing of this IGA between the Australian and Queensland governments, the essential health support and school education services currently delivered by the New South Wales government will transition to Queensland from January 1, 2022, heralding a new and sustainable future for state-type services on Norfolk Island,” he said.“Our government is committed to ensuring continuity of essential services during the transition to Queensland as delivery partner.”Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said she looked forward to the transition.“With the signing of the IGA between the Queensland government and the Commonwealth, we can now progress the work of transitioning essential services, to provide greater clarity and certainty for Norfolk Island’s more than 1700 residents,” she said.“I’m proud of the Queensland government’s long history of delivering world-class services to geographically remote locations, and we look forward to tailoring future delivery models to address the unique and long-term needs of the Norfolk Island community.”The Norfolk Island Regional Council was established on July 1, 2016, with a contract for Commonwealth-funded services.NSW planned to stop education and health services to the island on June 30 this year. However, discussions led to the government extending its services until December 31, with fears of no signed agreement from other states to take on the task.Queensland showed interest in signing on in January and reaffirmed its intention in June.Ms Hale said there were concerns from recruiting teachers and clerical staff over not knowing what forms to use when enrolling new students or students picking elective subjects.She said teachers took action by halting school work for periods of almost one hour, against the federal government’s “incompetence”, before the agreement.“The way this has been managed for the Commonwealth for the Norfolk people, you can’t say you’re taking on the responsibility and then ignore it for so long,” she said.“We’ve got to recruit and house potentially 25 teachers in about 13 or 14 weeks until day one of 2022,” she said, the situation worsened by what she described as a crisis of house prices and car availability on the island.However, on Wednesday Ms Hale said the school community was relieved and enthusiastic with a new education provider.“We’re all such professionals and want to see the continuity of services for the school.“We’ll make it work and the spirit of what Queensland has brought to this is what we need,” she said.",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.219%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_106%2C$y_225/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/0f1c67bf8cd0426ef36b0c302f4f0f1b060ab04c,"Crown Melbourne to keep casino licence for now despite 'disgraceful' conduct - ABC News
