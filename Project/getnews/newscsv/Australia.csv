"Crown warns of loan default risk if royal commission revokes casino license - Sydney Morning Herald
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Crown Resorts has claimed it could default on its debt if Victoria’s royal commission makes negative findings against its Melbourne casino licence with “severe consequences” for shareholders and thousands of employees.The casino giant’s executive chairman,  the company was trying to interfere with the inquiry when it wrote to Victorian Gaming Minister Melissa Horne last week warning it was “not in the public interest for Crown to fail”.Crown says it could default on its loans if the commission makes adverse findings against it. Credit:Chris HopkinsA redacted version of the letter was made public on Friday morning, and shows Crown told the minister that the jobs of 12,000 people who work at its Southbank complex could be at risk if there was a negative finding against it.Commissioner Ray Finkelstein is considering whether Crown is fit to hold its licence for the Southbank casino, after an inquiry in NSW ruled in January it was unsuitable to run its new Sydney casino.References to any particular outcome from the inquiry were redacted in the letter, but it appears to contemplate the $8 billion ASX-listed group losing its licence.The letter goes on to say that Crown would be at risk of breaching its lending covenants as a result of a negative ruling and makes reference to conditions attached to around $700 million of company debt.“If there is an EOD [event of default] it may have severe consequences for Crown and all its stakeholders,” the letter from Crown’s lawyer, Arnold Bloch Leibler partner Leon Zwier, says.“This will impact on Crown’s shareholders, employees, unions, trade creditors, patrons, the hotel precinct and the Melbourne tourism industry.”A default could also “provide potential overseas suitors an opportunity to take advantage of the situation”, the letter says.Crown has in recent months received takeover offers from US private equity firms Blackstone and Oaktree, as well as a merger proposal from its Sydney rival The Star.The letter says that most of Crown Melbourne’s employees are “disconnected from, and have not directly or indirectly contributed to the failures of Old Crown”.“Through COVID 19 they have suffered significant uncertainties. They will suffer greater uncertainties if there is an [event of default],” it says.Mr Zwier asked Ms Horne to meet him and Ms Coonan “urgently to discuss these issues and a proposal to put in place additional safeguards to further assure the state the Crown is different from Old Crown”.The inquiry heard on Friday - its last day of public hearings - that two-thirds of patrons trying to deposit $25,000 or more at the casino were not going ahead with the transaction after Crown recently implemented a new policy to make them disclose the source of their funds.Robyn McKern, a partner at McGrathNicol, which the commission engaged to review Crown’s anti-money laundering program, said those transactions were not going ahead because patrons either could not provide the required information or they chose to “walk away” when asked where their money came from.Ms McKern agreed that there could be “pressure” on the anti-money laundering team because that and other new policies were costing Crown large sums of money. “There might be commercial pressure around that,” she said. “I think that goes for all of the controls that have been put in.”McGrathNicol’s report also found 1914 indications of possible money laundering in Crown’s internal patron accounts, including some transactions as recent as June. However, Ms McKern said those transactions could be “general gaming behaviour” and further investigation was required to determine if they were likely to be illegal activity.Commissioner Finkelstein will report his findings by October 15.The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.Billionaire rag trader Solomon Lew has announced he will call Myer shareholders in for an extraordinary general meeting in an effort to force the resignation of the retailer three remaining non-executive directors.Mr Lew’s investment company Premier Investments announced on Friday it had instructed its lawyers, Arnold Bloch Leibler, to request a copy of Myer’s shareholder register with a view to contact the company’s investors and garner support ahead of calling a meeting of shareholders.Solomon Lew has begun the process of calling an extraordinary general meeting of Myer shareholders.Credit:Eddie JimPremier, which holds 15.8 per cent of Myer shares after upping its stake earlier this week, has also started consulting Myer’s other shareholders over rejigging the retailer’s board, indicating Mr Lew believes he has the required support to oust the company’s remaining directors.“Premier has commenced consultation with fellow Myer shareholders regarding the quick reconstitution of a majority independent Myer board with the necessary skills and experience,” Premier said in a statement.Premier has also retained proxy firm Morrow Sodali to collect proxy votes from investors ahead of the EGM. Once Myer is provided notice of intention to call an EGM, the company has 21 days to call one.However, Mr Lew and Premier appear to be hoping to force Myer’s directors out without needing to take it to a vote, with the billionaire’s company again calling for the board to “resign immediately”.“In Premier’s view, Myer’s three remaining non-executive directors should for once put its shareholders first and resign immediately. Any other action would be futile, and costly for Myer shareholders who have endured enough,” Premier said.A Myer spokesperson said it would provide Premier with a copy of the shareholder register now that it had received a formal legal request and would consult with shareholders over the best course of action.However, the company appeared to suggest it believed Mr Lew should launch a full takeover offer if he wished to gain control of the retailer.“We do not believe it is in shareholders’ best interests to allow Premier Investments to take or exert control of Myer without shareholders realising an appropriate premium and appropriate value for this effective change of control,” the spokesperson said.Myer’s board consists of just four members: acting chairman JoAnne Stephenson, chief executive John King, and non-executive directors Dave Whittle and Jacquie Naylor. Mr Lew is seeking the resignation of all bar Mr King.The veteran retailer’s latest move marks the most significant escalation of his war on Myer since successfully forcing the departure of former chairman Garry Hounsell at the company’s annual general meeting last year.Following his departure, Mr Lew remained quiet until earlier this week when he acquired an additional $41 million in Myer shares, boosting his stake to 15.8 per cent, strengthening his calls for the company’s board to resign.On Wednesday, Myer acquiesced to Mr Lew’s calls and offered the retailer board representation. A day later Mr Lew rejected the offer, saying Premier had “nothing to gain” by working with the current board.Fund manager Wilson Asset Management is Myer’s next largest shareholder after Premier, with US fund Dimensional coming in third. The remainder of the register is made up of a number of smaller investors, who may be inclined to support Mr Lew given Myer’s depressed share price.Shares in the retailer were up 2.3 per cent at 44 cents on Friday afternoon.Oscar Oberg, fund manager at Wilson Asset Management, did not indicate how the fund would vote, saying it would wait and see what happens. “We’re just going to let it all play out, he said. “We don’t have a rush to make any decision as of yet.”The retailer’s market capitalisation has been wiped out by $780 million since Mr Lew first bought in at the start of 2017 thanks to a number of management missteps and weak market conditions. Last year, the company reported a full-year loss of $172 million.The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.328%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_197%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/22e3202403160267e1472fef2f6386dce6046aa6,"ASX caught up in global sell-off - The Australian Financial Review

"Pfizer to seek urgent US consent for third vaccine doses - The Australian Financial Review
Washington |  for a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine, saying on Thursday (Friday AEST) that another shot within 12 months could dramatically boost immunity and maybe help ward off the worrisome delta variant.Research from multiple countries shows the Pfizer shot and other widely used COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against the , which is spreading rapidly around the world and now accounts for most new US infections.Nurse Jessica Lipscomb gives Miguel Castro, 13, the Pfizer vaccine in the Antioch Middle School gym in California. APTwo doses of most vaccines are critical to develop high levels of virus-fighting antibodies against all versions of the coronavirus, not just the delta variant, and most of the world still is desperate to get those initial protective doses as the pandemic continues to rage.But antibodies naturally wane over time, so studies are under way to tell if and when boosters might be needed.Pfizer’s Mikael Dolsten said early data from its booster study suggests people’s antibody levels jump fivefold to tenfold after a third dose, compared with their second dose months earlier.Pfizer planned to ask the US Food and Drug Administration next month for emergency authorisation of a third dose, he said.Dr Dolsten pointed to data from Britain and Israel showing the Pfizer vaccine “neutralises the delta variant very well”. The assumption, he said, was that when antibodies drop low enough, the delta virus eventually could cause a mild infection before the immune system kicks back in.FDA authorisation would not automatically mean Americans get offered boosters, said William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Centre. Public health authorities would have to decide if they were really needed, especially since millions of people have no protection.“The vaccines were designed to keep us out of the hospital” and continue to do so despite the more contagious delta variant, Dr Schaffner said. Giving another dose would be “a huge effort while we are at the moment striving to get people the first dose”.About 48 per cent of America’s population is fully vaccinated, although some parts of the country have far lower immunisation rates – places where the delta variant is surging.That was leading to “two truths” – highly immunised swaths of America were getting back to normal while hospitalisations were rising in other places, said Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.“This rapid rise is troubling,” Dr Walensky said. A few weeks ago the delta variant accounted for just over a quarter of new US cases, but that has just exceeded 50 per cent – and in some places, such as parts of the Midwest, as much as 80 per cent.Researchers from France’s Pasteur Institute on Thursday reported new evidence that full vaccination was critical.In laboratory tests, blood from several dozen people given their first dose of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines “barely inhibited” the delta variant, the team reported in the journal Nature.But weeks after getting their second dose, nearly all had what researchers deemed an immune boost strong enough to neutralise the delta variant – even if it was a little less potent than against earlier versions of the virus.The French researchers also tested unvaccinated people who had survived a bout of the coronavirus, and found their antibodies were fourfold less potent against the new mutant.But a single vaccine dose dramatically boosted their antibody levels, sparking cross-protection against the delta variant and two other mutants, the study found. That supports public health recommendations that COVID-19 survivors get vaccinated rather than relying on natural immunity.The lab experiments add to real-world data that the delta variant’s mutations are not evading the vaccines most widely used in Western countries, but underscore that it is crucial to get more of the world immunised before the virus evolves even further.For example, researchers in Britain found two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are 96 per cent protective against hospitalisation with the delta variant and 88 per cent effective against symptomatic infection. That finding was echoed last weekend by Canadian researchers, while a report from Israel suggested protection against mild delta infection may have dipped lower, to 64 per cent.Whether people who are fully vaccinated still need to wear masks in places where the delta variant is surging is a growing question.In the US, the CDC maintains that fully vaccinated people don’t need to. Even before the delta variant came along, the vaccines were not perfect, but the best evidence suggests that if vaccinated people nonetheless get the coronavirus, they’ll have much milder cases.“Let me emphasise: if you were vaccinated, you have a very high degree of protection,” Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top infectious disease expert, said on Thursday.In the US, case rates have been rising for weeks and the rate of hospitalisations has started to tick up, rising 7 per cent from the previous seven-day average, the CDC’s Dr Walensky said.However, deaths remain down, on average, which some experts believe is at least partly due to high vaccination rates in people 65 and older, who are among the most susceptible to severe disease.",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"Liberal MP calls AstraZeneca restriction into question - WAtoday
We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, Liberal MP Katie Allen, who worked as a paediatrician and public health professor before entering politics, has revealed that she wrote to the government’s vaccine advisory group asking it to review its advice restricting AstraZeneca to older Australians.Dr Allen is unhappy at the poor reputation AstraZeneca has developed in Australia given its effectiveness, especially against severe COVID-19, and overall safety. “I’m deeply disappointed about the way the Australian population has perceived the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Dr Allen said on Q+A on Thursday night.Liberal MP Katie Allen has backed the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Credit:Paul JeffersHer intervention is another sign of the government’s enthusiasm for a wider use of AstraZeneca, which is locally made and much more plentiful than Pfizer, as the number of Delta-variant COVID cases in Sydney grows.It comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians in areas of high virus transmission to compress the time between their  and ahead of a national cabinet meeting on Friday, where AstraZeneca policy is again likely to be on the agenda.There have been three deaths likely linked to the vaccine out of about 4.5 million doses delivered so far and Dr Allen said treatments for those very rare side effects had improved as the rollout advanced. “Early on the clots associated with AstraZeneca were being mistreated by doctors,” Dr Allen said. “That’s been rectified now.”The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommended on June 17 that AstraZeneca be constrained to people over 60 while everyone younger was told to get the Pfizer jab. It had earlier raised the recommended age for AstraZeneca from 40 to 50.On June 8, Dr Allen wrote to ATAGI urging it to review that advice based on newer data and changing treatments for the clotting condition linked to the vaccine.“Consideration of this request is important... in helping Australia rapidly roll out the COVID-19 vaccine by reassuring the general public on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines to mitigate vaccine hesitancy,” Dr Allen wrote in the letter, seen by The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald. She also said it would send a strong message to Australia’s neighbours in the Pacific that the vaccine was safe for their populations, which are younger on average than Australia’s and have been receiving airshipped AstraZeneca doses.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has in recent weeks urged Australians younger than 60 to speak to their doctors about being vaccinated with AstraZeneca, which is a step long technically supported by the health advice, but not emphasised by ATAGI.“ATAGI can provide advice but at the end of the day the government should make the decision,” Dr Allen said, though she stopped short of saying ATAGI’s advice should have been overriden, instead suggesting the framing of its message as sub-par.ATAGI did not reply to Dr Allen’s letter, but about a fortnight later raised the recommended age to 60 in a clear implicit rejection.Later on the program Dr Allen said that she had not read the Auditor-General’s report on the Morrison government’s $660 million commuter car park program and agreed its findings that many decisions within it were not merit based, effective or transparent sounded “damning”.The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.265%2C$multiply_0.3541%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e1595af2ccd43d02213f18f73b8ab59a3bf9aa5f,"Yes, you can still get COVID after being vaccinated, but you're unlikely to get as sick - The Conversation AU

But when you read past the headlines, you usually see the answer: in most cases, those who were vaccinated and contracted COVID-19 didn’t die, didn’t develop severe symptoms and didn’t need to be hospitalised. For unvaccinated Australians in their later years, the chance of dying from COVID is high. For unvaccinated people in their 80s, around 32% who contract COVID will die from it. For people in their 70s, it’s around 14%. (For unvaccinated people in their 60s, it drops to around 3%. And for under-50s, it’s less than 1%.)The good news is both Pfizer and AstraZeneca are very effective at preventing severe disease and death from COVID-19, even from the more virulent Delta strain. Preliminary data from the United Kingdom shows after your first dose of either Pfizer or AstraZeneca, you’re 33% less likely than an unvaccinated person to contract the Delta variant. Two weeks after your second dose, this rises to 60% for AstraZeneca and 88% for Pfizer. This data is for any form of COVID-19, from mild to severe.But when you look at how much the vaccines reduce your risk of developing severe illness that requires hospitalisation, the coverage is high for both. Pfizer and Astrazeneca vaccines are 96% and 92% effective (respectively) in preventing Delta variant hospitalisations.Vaccines aren’t magic barriers. They don’t kill the virus or pathogen they target. Rather, vaccines stimulate a person’s immune system to create antibodies. These antibodies are specific against the virus or pathogen for the vaccine and allows the body to fight infection before it takes hold and causes severe disease. However, some people won’t have a strong enough immune response to the vaccine and may still be susceptible to developing COVID-19 if exposed to the virus. How a person responds to a vaccine is impacted by a number of host factors, including our age, gender, medications, diet, exercise, health and stress levels.

It’s not easy to tell who hasn’t developed a strong enough immune response to the vaccine. Measuring a person’s immune response to a vaccine is not simple and requires detailed laboratory tests.And while side effects from the vaccine indicate you’re having a response, the absence of symptoms doesn’t mean you’re having a weak response.It also takes time for the immune system to respond to vaccines and produce antibodies. For most two-shot vaccines, antibody levels rise and then dip after the first dose. These antibodies are then boosted after the second. But you’re not optimally covered until your antibody levels rise after the second dose. The PCR tests we use to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, are very sensitive and can detect a positive case even if you have low levels of the virus in your system. This means a person can test positive for SARS-CoV-2 but still not have symptoms of COVID-19.Of those vaccinated people who have reported symptoms, the vast majority report mild ones, with a shorter duration.

There is always a chance a vaccinated person could pass the virus onto a non-vaccinated person . But vaccinated people who develop COVID-19 will likely have a lower viral load than unvaccinated people, meaning they’re less likely to spread the virus. One study estimated those who were vaccinated with either Pfizer or AstraZeneca were 50% less likely to pass it on to an unvaccinated household contact than someone who wasn’t vaccinated. This transmission will likely reduce again if both household members are vaccinated. But if you’re not vaccinated and contract COVID-19, you’re  to spread the virus. So far, the preliminary data (some of which is ongoing and/or yet to be peer reviewed) shows our current vaccines are effective at protecting against circulating variants.But as the virus mutates, there is increasing chance of viral escape. This means there is a greater chance the virus will develop mutations that make it fitter against, or more easily able to evade, vaccinations. Scientist are closely monitoring to ensure our current and/or future vaccines are effective against the circulating strains. To help the fight against COVID-19 the best thing we can do is minimise the spread of the virus. This means get vaccinated when you can, ensure you maintain social distancing when required and get tested if you have any symptoms.

"Angry handbags and happy coffee: Our brains see expressions on faces in everyday objects - The Transcontinental
We end up with something strange: a parallel experience that it is both a compelling face and an object.Human brains are great at processing faces quickly, which means we sometimes mistakenly see ""faces"" in inanimate objects, an error known as face pareidolia. But it turns out our brains don't stop there - Aussie scientists have found our brains not only recognise the face but they subject it to facial expression analysis in the same way as real faces. It's so commonplace we barely give it a second thought, but human brains seem hardwired to see human faces where there are none - in objects as varied as the moon, toys, plastic bottles, tree trunks and veggies.Until now scientists haven't understood exactly what the brain is doing when it processes visual signals and interprets them as representations of the human face.More lifestyle:Neuroscientists at the University of Sydney now say how our brains identify and analyse real human faces is conducted by the same cognitive processes that identify illusory faces.""From an evolutionary perspective, it seems that the benefit of never missing a face far outweighs the errors where inanimate objects are seen as faces,"" said Professor David Alais lead author of the study from the School of Psychology.""There is a great benefit in detecting faces quickly,"" he said, ""but the system plays 'fast and loose' by applying a crude template of two eyes over a nose and mouth. Lots of things can satisfy that template and thus trigger a face detection response.""This facial recognition response happens lightning fast in the brain: within a few hundred milliseconds.""We know these objects are not truly faces, yet the perception of a face lingers,"" Professor Alais said. ""We end up with something strange: a parallel experience that it is both a compelling face and an object. Two things at once. The first impression of a face does not give way to the second perception of an object.""It is such a common occurrence that we accept the notion of detecting faces in objects as 'normal' - but humans do not experience this cognitive process as strongly for other phenomena.The brain has evolved specialised neural mechanisms to rapidly detect faces and it exploits the common facial structure as a short-cut for rapid detection.""Pareidolia faces are not discarded as false detections but undergo facial expression analysis in the same way as real faces,"" Professor Alais said.Not only do we imagine faces, we analyse them and give them emotional attributes. The researchers say this expression analysis of inanimate objects is because as deeply social beings, simply detecting a face isn't enough.""We need to read the identity of the face and discern its expression. Are they a friend or a foe? Are they happy, sad, angry, pained?"" Professor Alais said.What the study examined was whether once a pareidolia face is detected, it is subsequently analysed for facial expression, or discarded from face processing as a false detection.The research shows that once a false face is retained by the brain it is analysed for its facial expression in the same way a real face is.""We showed this by presenting sequences of faces and having participants rate each face's expression on a scale ranging from angry to happy,"" Professor Alais said.What was intriguing is that a known bias in judging human faces persisted with analysis of inanimate imagined faces.""When objects look compellingly face-like, it is more than an interpretation: they really are driving your brain's face detection network. And that scowl, or smile; that's your brain's facial expression system at work. For the brain, fake or real, faces are all processed the same way.""",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"University scientists help to unlock hidden secrets of UK meteorite - Mirage News
Scientists from the University of Plymouth are helping to uncover the secrets of a rare meteorite which could possibly reveal the origins of oceans and life on Earth.Research carried out on the Winchcombe meteorite, , estimates the space rock dates back to the beginning of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.The meteorite was tracked using video footage from the UK’s meteor camera networks, including the UK Fireball Network, and fragments where then quickly located and recovered.Since the discovery, UK planetary scientists – including Dr Natasha Stephen and colleagues in the University’s  – have been trying to determine its mineralogy and chemistry to better understand how the solar system formed.They have found the meteorite is a carbonaceous chondrite – a stony material, rich in water and organic matter, which has retained its chemistry from the formation of the solar system.In fact, initial analyses – funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) – have shown it to be a member of the CM (“Mighei-type”) group of carbonaceous chondrites, a classification has now been formally approved by the Meteoritical Society.Dr Stephen, Director of the Plymouth Electron Microscopy Centre, has spent more than a decade analysing Martian meteorites and has been on meteorite hunting expeditions all over the world. She added:“Collecting meteorites in the field is always special, but doing it in your home country is even more so. Now we have a piece of Winchcombe to analyse right here in Plymouth. It’s the first time we’ve had a British meteorite in the lab, so everyone is incredibly excited and keen to be a part of the initial analyses. The small planetary geology group we have here are all helping, thanks to STFC funding, so it’s been a fantastic catalyst for a new study bringing together academics, technicians and students.”Current student: ResM Geological Sciences“I chose to study in Plymouth because I really like the area and its closeness to the sea. I also had friends who did their geology degrees at the University of Plymouth and they really enjoyed the course. The range of field trips that were advertised was also a big incentive.I’ve found the subject really inspiring. We are still finding so much new information about planetary science, and it’s really rewarding. Before I came to Plymouth, I had a huge interest in planetary science but I didn’t think there was anywhere to go career-wise in the subject. Since then, I have been introduced to so many people and opportunities that will allow me to get my foot in the door within the field.” Our flagship facility provides access to a comprehensive suite of light microscopes, electron microscopes (EM), image processing and analysis software, plus decades of experience from our team of specialists.We support students, researchers, academics and businesses across a range of disciplines and sectors, from engineering and advanced manufacturing to geology, textiles, planetary science and beyond.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Facebook teaches walking AI robots to adapt on the fly to terrain such as dirt, sand and even swamps - SiliconANGLE News
Facebook Inc.’s artificial intelligence researchers have come up with a more advanced method of teaching walking robots to adapt to different kinds of terrain on the fly.Using the method, robots can with relative ease make their way across sand, loose rocks, deep grass, muddy fields, slippery surfaces and anything else they encounter.The Rapid Motor Adaptation method of teaching robots to adapt to their environment was developed in collaboration with researchers from the University of California at Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University. It also helps robots to react to other changes they may experience while walking, such as if a heavy weight is suddenly thrown upon them.AI researcher Ashish Kumar from UC Berkeley, along with his colleagues Zipeng Fu and Deepak Pathak from Carnegie Mellon and Jitendra Malik from Facebook AI Research, said in a blog post that RMA will help make robots more effective in situations such as a search and rescue operations. Up until now, walking robots have struggled to adjust for the countless changes in their environment that they must contend with, which include different types of surface, slopes and obstacles in their path.Previously, robots were taught to cope with different terrains through a series of sophisticated hand coding and learning techniques. Facebook said RMA combines a base policy trained through reinforcement learning with an adaptation module trained using supervised learning to help robots teach themselves about their surroundings and how to adapt to them instantly.“The base policy is learned in simulation with real life, using carefully curated information about different environments (like the amount of friction and weight and shape of the payload),” the researchers explained. “We set different variables — simulating more or less slippery ground or the grade of an incline — so it learns the right controls for different conditions, and we encode info about those variables as ‘extrinsics.’”The base policy isn’t enough, though, as the actual extrinsics the robots will encounter in the real world aren’t known. So RMA also relies on information that the robot teaches itself about its surroundings, based on its most recent body movement. For example, if the robot suddenly comes across a softer surface such as mud, its leg will extend further as its foot sinks into the ground, whereas on a harder surface its leg would stop sooner.The base policy then helps train the adaptation module, based on this information, to teach the robot how to adapt almost instantaneously.“RMA is the first entirely learning-based system to enable a legged robot to adapt to its environment from scratch, by exploring and interacting with the world,” the researchers said. “With this combination of a base policy and an adaptation module, the robot can adapt to new conditions in fractions of a second.”One clear advantage of the RMA method is it helps robots do more than just adjust to different terrain. It allows them to take into account things such as wear and tear, such as a dent that appears on its foot or worn-down parts in its leg, for example. It can even help a robot adjust instantly for the weight that’s thrust upon it if it has to pick up an injured person during a rescue operation.The researchers said that experiments have shown RMA-enabled robots outperforming non-RMA bots in numerous kinds of challenging terrain, including sand, mud, hiking trails and even a dirt pile.“The robot successfully walked down stairs along a hiking trail in 70% of the trials,” the researchers wrote. “It successfully navigated a cement pile and a pile of pebbles in 80% of the trials despite never seeing the unstable or sinking ground, obstructive vegetation or stairs during training. It also maintained its height with a high success rate when moving with a 12kg payload that amounted to 100% of its body weight.”﻿The researchers said they believe RMA could be transformational in the world of robotics, helping to create a new generation of more advanced, adaptable walking robots. The most obvious application is in search and rescue operations in areas that might be too dangerous or inaccessible for human rescuers. But there are other applications too — for instance, maintenance robots that need to work in remote locations and also military applications.Analyst Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. said the development of RMA is an exciting one because intelligent adaptation is one of the key challenges that AI has struggled to overcome.“Now Facebook and its research partners have finally achieved this, it is a big milestone,” he sad. “It has made real progress in an automation area that has not previously been given much attention by deep learning researchers. It’ll be fun to see how robot makers in the real world can use this new AI framework.”Beyond robotics, RMA also highlights the potential of building other kinds of AI systems that can adapt to numerous changes they face in real time, simply by leveraging data on the fly to understand the context in which an algorithm operates.“This is a broad, long-term challenge that will require progress in many subfields beyond reinforcement learning,” the researchers said.We are holding our second cloud startup showcase on June 16. .“TheCUBE is part of re:Invent, you know, you guys really are a part of the event and we really appreciate your coming here and I know people appreciate the content you create as well” – Andy JassyWe really want to hear from you.

The “Evening Star” and the “Red Planet”—the planets of love and war, respectively—are about to “meet” during dusk in one of the planet-gazing highlights of the year. On Tuesday, July 13, 2021, Mars and Venus will appear to be just 0.5º from each other from Earth. However, while the two planets either side of Earth’s orbit will appear to be closest on that date, they will look almost as close in a few nights before and after—with the added bonus of a super-slim crescent Moon in attendance! That makes it a “triple conjunction” and one that’s worth looking for this weekend through Wednesday. Of course, it’s all a line-of-sight illusion since the planets are millions of miles apart, but they will seem to be close together for a few nights. It’s also the first of three conjunctions of Venus and Mars inside just eight months, with similar sights possible on both February 12 and March 12, 2022. So it’s a “triple conjunction” in two senses. Here’s everything you need to know to see this conjunction of Mars, Venus and the Moon—though do also check  for an exact schedule: When: Just after sunset on Sunday, July 11, 2021Where: west-northwest sky Tonight Venus will be flanked by a dim Mars and a 3.4%-lit crescent Moon, which is just about the slimmest our satellite can be to be seen. When: Just after sunset on Monday, July 12, 2021Where: west-northwest skyVenus and Mars will appear to be at their closest just after sunrise in North America on July 13, so the best times to see them together will be during the evening of July 12 or July 13—so just before and just after the main event. Look on July 12 and you’ll see an 8.4%-lit waxing crescent Moon just 3º above the two planets. Mars will be to the lower-left of Venus, about 0.5º from its brighter companion. By chance today sees Mars reach its aphelion—the precise point in its slightly elliptical orbit where it’s furthest from the Sun. When: Just after sunset on Tuesday, July 13, 2021Where: west-northwest skyTonight the planets will again be about 0.5º from each other, this time with Mars below Venus. To the upper left of the planets you’ll see Regulus, a bright star in the constellation of Leo, and a 16%-lit crescent Moon beyond. When: Just after sunset on Wednesday, July 14, 2021Where: west-northwest skyThe conjunction has passed and the now 25%-lit crescent Moon is past its slimmest and getting far from the planetary duo, but tonight it’s still worth getting outside. Venus will have overtaken Mars slightly, with the latter now visible to the lower-right of the brighter planet. Although you’ll be able to see Venus and the Moon naked-eye, Mars will be a little tricker. In fact, it’s going to be about 200 times dimmer. So while the Moon and Venus will be very easy to spot, it will help to know exactly where Mars is so you can get eyes-on. You may have to wait until the sky darkens for Mars to become visible, or else use binoculars. Good luck—here’s a great chance to see the Moon at its slimmest, Venus at its brightest and best, and a last chance to see Mars before it sinks towards the setting Sun.

"New MacBook Pro could kill off Touch Bar, rumors suggest - Techradar
Apple’s revamped  to arrive at some point in 2021 could be bereft of the Touch Bar, going by fresh speculation which backs up what we’ve already heard from several sources earlier this year.This comes from Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC), as spotted by 9 to 5 Mac, with the analyst firm believing that the Touch Bar – the slim touchscreen strip that offers context-sensitive actions and shortcuts with supported apps – could be ditched by Apple, and replaced instead with a traditional row of function keys on top of the keyboard.DSCC observes: “Touch Bars continue to be the #3 application with a 18% unit share and 1.2% revenue share in Q1’21. We expect Touch Bars to be exceeded by tablets when Apple starts the adoption of the 10.9” AMOLED iPad. Further, our sources suggest that Apple may cancel the Touch Bar in the future.”Note the use of the word ‘may’, so there certainly seems room for doubt here – but as we said at the outset, there are several trusted Apple sources who have already indicated that the Touch Bar is on the chopping block.That includes Ming-Chi Kuo, one of the most respected Apple leakers in terms of accuracy, and Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, another heavyweight rumor peddler who has asserted in the past that Apple has been testing certain models of the redesigned MacBook Pro without a Touch Bar, due to the fact that some users don’t find it all that useful.So it could be the case that we have some MacBook Pro models with the bar, and some without, although mixing and matching like that could cause its own problems, perhaps discouraging developers from further supporting the Touch Bar (if not every MacBook Pro owner is going to be able to make use of the functionality therein). Or, as this latest nugget suggests, the Touch Bar could simply be dropped altogether.This would be an admission of defeat by Apple, of sorts, but aside from how popular or useful the Touch Bar may or may not be perceived to be, there could be other reasons behind potentially dropping the strip – perhaps bound up with touchscreen-related component shortages. Of course, removing the Touch Bar would also free up budget in terms of the cost of materials for the MacBook Pro, money which could perhaps be better spent elsewhere (indeed, maybe that purported Mini-LED screen is hoovering up huge chunks of the budget).Time will tell, as ever, but the fact that this rumor is persisting throughout this year seems to point to an abandonment – or semi-ditching, with certain models as Gurman has suggested – is certainly a possibility.The Touch Bar has always been a rather divisive feature, with some MacBook owners swearing by it, and others swearing at it, the latter preferring physical buttons (with less potential to develop faults, in theory) and their tactile feel instead.Darren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

The Dragon has a champion. Qualcomm and Asus today unveiled the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, a $1,499 phone that represents the full power of the Snapdragon 888 chipset, Qualcomm says.""Never before has such a complete Snapdragon experience been brought together in one single amazing device,"" says Mike Roberts, Qualcomm's VP of product marketing.""We wanted to offer our insiders something unique, something to showcase the value proposition of Snapdragon devices,"" Roberts says.Like other ecosystem-partner companies, Qualcomm does things that don't make it to market because its partners decide not to go with them. We tend to see some of these tricks, usually camera capabilities, demoed at the Snapdragon Summit event each fall. Qualcomm's 65-watt QuickCharge 5 charging hasn't seen much uptake in US phones. Qualcomm's official list has only the RedMagic 6 and 6 Pro phones with QuickCharge 5. Its Snapdragon Sound high-res audio initiative has gotten off to a slow start, as well, with only Xiaomi on board so far.So this phone is a chance to show off those features and ideas. With QuickCharge 5 and a charger in the box, the phone charges at 65w, filling 70% of its 4,000mAh battery in 30 minutes and topping off the battery in 52 minutes. The phone comes with Master & Dynamic Snapdragon Sound earbuds that support 24-bit, 96kHz audio and high-quality voice codecs.On the back, there's a second-generation Qualcomm ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. Those have been popular (in the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, among other phones) but the fingerprint sensor market is pretty competitive, so Qualcomm wants to make a stand.For gaming, the phone has a 6.78-inch, 2,448-by-1,080 Samsung AMOLED screen with a 144Hz screen refresh rate. That refresh rate isn't seen often on US phones, but it's the refresh rate most often cited by Qualcomm when it's doing Snapdragon Elite Gaming demos. A ""quick touch"" algorithm improves touch response by 20%, Roberts says. The phone is stuffed with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.The radio features are also pretty amazing here; this will be the best global-roaming phone ever. Phone makers almost always trim the set of frequency bands and radios they support, to target particular networks. This baby has everything. It's got C-band. It's got 5G-over-CBRS. It's got Wi-Fi 6E. It's got not only US millimeter-wave 5G, but Asian and European mmWave bands that haven't even been turned on yet. It has dual 5G SIM slots. The one thing it doesn't have is US carrier certification, but Qualcomm says it's working on that.The three rear cameras are a 64MP main, 12MP ultra-wide and 8MP, 3x zoom. The front camera is a 24MP model. The most shocking omission, though, is that there's no plan out of the gate to upgrade this phone beyond its stock, bloatware-free Android 11. While Qualcomm has committed to four years of security updates, the company says it hasn't sorted out an answer on Android version updates yet.Qualcomm isn't committing to any future devices beyond this one. It's an experiment. This isn't the Surface or the Pixel (more on that below.) Maybe there will be another one. Maybe not.Qualcomm wants to make it clear that while this phone is good, it is not better than any other Qualcomm-based phone, even though it is. But it also isn't. You got that?""This device is not meant to compete with any of our OEM partners,"" Roberts says.Qualcomm isn't a phone maker (anymore), and unlike Microsoft or Google, it doesn't appear to have the confidence to put out a hardware line that competes with its licensees. That results, in this case, with Qualcomm repeatedly saying that this is an ""Asus device"" and that it is for ""this target audience of Snapdragon insiders,"" and—let's make clear—not a single other person.This comes back to the delicate dance Microsoft and Google do with the Surface and Pixel, respectively, but it's even more delicate here. Microsoft and Google both use Surface and Pixel to experiment with new technologies or suggest ideas they'd like to see taken up by partners. Surface ignited the 2-in-1 form-factor market, and Pixel always has the latest Google software innovations. But their partners also have nowhere else to turn. HP isn't going to move to a different desktop OS. Samsung has tried to create its own smartphone OS twice, with Bada and Tizen, and failed both times.Qualcomm's market is much, much more competitive. An even slightly miffed partner could turn to MediaTek Dimensity or Samsung Exynos in the West, or to Unisoc or Huawei in China. So while Google tacitly doesn't anger its OEMs by quietly not selling all that many Pixels, Qualcomm has to put up flags and fireworks to explain that this phone is in no way a threat to its Very Good Partners.""All of our OEMs we love, and we don't want to be a 'this is better than that,'"" Roberts says. But of course, if this isn't better than anything, why does it exist? Contradictions abound.At $1,499, anyway, this phone is going to be a curiosity. There's room for that in the world! The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 costs $1,999 and it's fun as heck. As someone who has been , I like to think of myself as a Snapdragon insider, so hopefully I'll get one to review.

Please try again later.Plans to force NDIS participants into controversial independent assessments to cut costs have been scrapped after the federal government could not get the agreement of states and territories.NDIS Minister Linda Reynolds met state and territory disability ministers on Friday to discuss the sustainability of the scheme and seek agreement on controversial overhauls for how individual eligibility for access is assessed.NDIS Minister Linda Reynolds.Credit:Alex EllinghausenThe NDIS has been trialling the use of independent assessments, in which the eligibility of individuals to access funding and the rate of funding is assessed by government-contracted health professionals rather than on reports submitted by their own medical specialists.The federal government wanted to implement the process right across the scheme but it has been met with fierce opposition from advocacy groups and people with disabilities who are concerned their needs wouldn’t be properly understood and the process would be used to stealthily reduce the cost of the scheme by constraining access and reducing individual funding rates.Any changes to the scheme required support from all states, which the independent assessment proposal did not have, forcing Senator Reynolds to agree to go back to the drawing board.NSW Disability Services Minister Alister Henskens, who attended the meeting, welcomed the decision and said a new assessment model would be devised.“Ministers agreed to the co-design of a new person-centred model that delivers consistency and equity in access and plan outcomes consistent with assessment requirements under the act,” he said.Victorian Minister for Disability, Ageing and Carers Luke Donnellan also welcomed the scrapping of independent assessments.“I thank all those Victorians with disability who have been advocating for months to stop the current independent assessments plans and look forward to the Victorian disability sector playing a key role,” he said.ACT Disability Minister Emma Davidson said the mood in the meeting leant toward a “person-centred” approach.“The time has come for genuine community co-design,” she said.The minister also raised concerns about the murkiness of data used by Senator Reynolds to claim the NDIS was facing severe sustainability issues.On Tuesday, she pointed to a report released by the National Disability Insurance Agency that forecast NDIS expenditure to grow to $40.7 billion in 2024-25, $8.8 billion above estimates.But states were sceptical about the figure, given the agency’s 2019-2020 annual report said financial projections aligned with the estimates shown in the 2017 Productivity Commission report.WA Disability Services Minister Don Punch said independent assessments were based on “unsubstantiated financial assumptions and wholly inadequate consultation”.Mr Henskens said his federal counterpart had agreed to “full and free flow” of all information about the scheme’s financial projections.Ms Reynolds said she was committed to working with her state and territory counterparts on a pathway forward.“Three months ago I announced a pause on the reforms while I consulted extensively. I also committed to provide greater transparency of information and returned today to discuss this with disability ministers,” she said.“After eight years of operations, now is the time to take the lessons of the lived experience and turn those lessons into a better NDIS.”She confirmed the independent assessment proposal would be scrapped and a new model would be developed to “deliver consistency and equity of both access and planning outcomes.”Federal opposition NDIS spokesman Bill Shorten said the decision was a huge win for people with disabilities.He criticised the independent assessments trial as an “amazing waste of money and source of trauma” and said the leaders of the NDIA should now quit after pursuing the idea.The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day’s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.23%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/9ea2d4d62a43d150a1850b8cad048cbd21cf4e83,"ACT police hunt for escaped prisoner after corrective services vehicle rammed near Manuka - ABC News
