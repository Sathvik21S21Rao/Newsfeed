"Rams HC Sean McVay on upset loss to 49ers: 'This was a humbling night' - NFL.com
NFL.com Digital Content EditorThough the game was in Santa Clara, California, it certainly had the feel of a Hollywood premiere.Under the Monday night lights and upon the prime-time stage, Odell Beckham and Von Miller made their Los Angeles Rams debuts.However, as the Rams were ready to roll out the red carpet, the underdog San Francisco 49ers were hardly ready to roll over and showed it with a physical, run-based attack from the start that led them to a 31-10 upset.""This was a humbling night for us,"" Rams head coach Sean McVay said.All in on their Super Bowl aspirations, the Rams (7-3) are sitting in second place in the NFC West after losing to the rival 49ers (4-5) for the fifth straight time.Not only was it an upset loss, but it was one in which the 49ers grounded and pounded their way to victory, running the ball 44 times for 156 yards. They were more often than not the more physical team on each side of the ball and it showed from the onset, when San Francisco took over after a Jimmie Ward interception and proceeded to run it right down the Rams' throats for a 7-0 lead it would never relinquish.It was an 18-play, 93-yard odyssey of an opening drive for the 49ers that took 11 minutes, 3 seconds of game clock and perhaps took something more from the Rams.""It's the way we want to do it,"" said 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo﻿, who ended the opening march with an 8-yard touchdown pass to George Kittle﻿. ""I don't want to say it took their soul away, but it definitely did something.""Following that soul-crushing opening salvo by the 49ers, Ward had yet another interception, returning this one for a touchdown when a Matthew Stafford pass was dropped by Tyler Higbee and cradled by Ward. The start was emphatic and methodical, and quick and staggering.""We wanted to make it as physical as possible and we knew if we did that, it would come down to the turnover battle,"" said 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan, whose team won the turnover battle, 2-0, thanks to Ward's two interceptions.The 49ers had forced their will, while the Rams seemed to have lost theirs.It was hardly following the script, as the 49ers, reeling all season, were supposed to be the first foe vanquished by the new-age band of Rams with Beckham and Miller adding to the all-star cast that is the Los Angeles roster. But it didn't go that way.Los Angeles, despite its additions over the last few weeks, has lost two in row to the Titans and 49ers, with each defeat coming by double-digit margins and the Rams' high-octane offense held to an average of 13 points.""I choose to believe that these last couple weeks are not who we are. I refuse to believe that, event that, you know what, you're only as good as your last game,"" McVay said. ""These last two weeks have certainly been humbling.""Heading into Monday, this game was very much all about the Rams and the hopeful debuts of Miller and Beckham, but the Niners apparently didn't get the memo.Stafford wasted no time in getting Beckham introduced to the Rams offense, hooking up with the former Browns and Giants wideout on the first play from scrimmage for a 5-yard gain. Unfortunately, Beckham tallied his first tackle as a Ram on the drive when a Stafford deep ball was intercepted. It appeared that Beckham and Stafford might not have been on the same page on the play. Perhaps Beckham didn't run the deep route Stafford expected or perhaps it was just a bad ball.""We didn't make enough plays,"" said McVay, whose team lost the time of possession battle, 39:03-20:57. ""Our best players didn't play up to their standards.""Stafford hooked up with Higbee for the Rams' only touchdown of the evening to cut the score to 14-7, but the 49ers responded with an 11-play, 91-yard scoring drive, underscoring that this was San Francisco's night and their style of game.""We were ready to play them today and we were excited to,"" Shanahan said.At one point, Jalen Ramsey could be seen yelling on the sidelines, while Miller was getting oxygen on the bench.When the loss had settled, Beckham and Miller, each downplayed it, simply chalking it up to a bad night against a team that played better.""Any given Sunday any team can win,"" Beckham said. ""Tonight, the Niners came out and they played better than us in all phases of the game. And that's really the moral of the story. There's no trying to find what happened, they just outplayed us.""Plenty of eyes were on Beckham, though. In six games with the Browns this season, he averaged 2.8 catches on 5.7 targets for 38.7 yards per game. In his Rams debut, he had two catches on three targets for 18 yards.""I was excited. Felt like I was ready for the moment,"" Beckham said. ""I've been through so much and God has put me in this position for that exact moment. And it just wasn't our night. There's really no way around it, it just wasn't our night.""""It's definitely been a movie, it's definitely been a good movie. Today was a bad scene, but I feel like we'll be able to fight out of this, I feel like we'll be able to recover from this,"" Miller said. ""But having Odell on this team, it's great. That's my buddy, on an off the football field. We continue to gel, I continue to gel. And I'm exciting. Losing is definitely not fun, but playing today was fun. Going out there and feeling myself move around and be quick and have some great rushes; I had fun today. I'm gonna gather myself, take the good and the bad and go into this bye week and figure it out. I feel excited about this football team, I feel excited about what we can do.""This one definitely went off-script.The 49ers aren't yet done this season and the Rams clearly haven't won the Super Bowl in November no matter how many big names they have on their roster.As Monday night beckoned, everyone was tuning in to see the new-look Rams, the star-studded Super Bowl contenders.When Monday night concluded, everyone saw the 49ers that many envisioned would be Super Bowl contenders before the season began.Said McVay: ""It's only going to take as much of a toll as we allow it to.""Said Shanahan: ""We need to start expecting some more games like that.""Once upon a time in the wild NFC West, things got a whole lot more interesting on Monday night.See all the ActionReplay every game all season.",https://res.cloudinary.com/stage-nflclubs/image/upload/49ers/f6b7udz3xm3jglfakq9q.svg,"Steph Curry vs. Kevin Durant highlights Warriors schedule - Golden State of Mind
It’s hard to believe it, but a month has already passed in the 2021-22 NBA season. And even though the Golden State Warriors enter the second month of action coming off of a loss, they’re feeling pretty darn good about their record.They’ve been the best team in the NBA through the first four weeks, and that’s without Klay Thompson. Permission for optimism granted.Now let’s recap the week that was, and look forward to the week that will be.Record: 11-2Standing: 1st seed in the Western ConferenceOffensive rating: 3rd (112.9)Defensive rating: 1st (100.4)Net rating: 1st (+12.5)Team ratings are garbage-time adjusted, courtesy of Cleaning The Glass.Monday: Wednesday: Friday: Sunday: Three wins by a combined 53 points, and a lone four-point loss? If you can’t have a perfect week, that’s perhaps the next best thing. The Dubs certainly started things in style with a trio of dominant victories, culminating in a 26-point beatdown of the Chicago Bulls, who look like a team capable of making a deep playoff run.So the week ended in defeat ... who cares? They happen. We’ll take three big steps forward and one little step back every week of the season. Steph Curry vs. the Hawks: 50 points, 7 rebounds, 10 assists, 4 steals, 1 block, 14-for-28 shooting, 9-for-19 threes, 13-for-13 free throws.Curry had a few low-scoring games as the Dubs coasted to victories, and then he took matters into his own hands against Atlanta, as if to remind everyone who he is, and what he’s capable of. And my goodness is he capable of a lot. 50 points and 10 assists? Plus an overflowing handful of rebounds from the point guard position, and a stellar defensive game?It was the best performance of the season. Not for Curry. Not for the Warriors. For the NBA. Honorable mention goes to...Andrew Wiggins vs. the Wolves: 35 points, 4 rebounds, 2 steals, 14-for-19 shooting, 3-for-6 threes, 4-for-4 free throws.Did Wiggins decide to take something out on his former team, or did he just happen to have  one of his best games in a Warriors jersey against the organization he played the first 442 games of his career for? We may never know, but what matters is he was utterly unstoppable on offense.And while we’re on the topic of Wiggins being unstoppable against the Timberwolves...OH MY WIGGINS Yeah, we’re gonna need to see some alternate angles and bench reactions for that one ...ARE YOU KIDDING ANDREW WIGGINS?! Tuesday: @ Brooklyn Nets (10-4), 4:30 p.m. PTThursday: @ Cleveland Cavaliers (9-5), 4:30 p.m. PTFriday: @ Detroit Pistons (3-9), 4:00 p.m. PTSunday: vs. Toronto Raptors (7-7), 5:00 p.m. PTIt’s another four-game week, and this time it’s only against Eastern Conference teams.Friday vs. the Pistons.Back ends of a road back-to-back are never easy, especially when capping off a four-game road trip. But when you look at the quality of the teams the Warriors are up against, the Pistons stand out a bit, and not in the good way.Truthfully, Detroit already having three wins is a bit surprising to me, though it’s worth noting that two of their wins (against the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic) came against two of the only three teams with a worse record.Detroit is running with a starting lineup of Killian Hayes, Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, and Isaiah Stewart. If you’re familiar with those five players, then congratulations: you are a hard, hardcore NBA fan.Tuesday vs. the Nets.Is this even a question? The Nets have the fourth-best record in the league, and the fifth-best net rating.More importantly, they have Kevin Durant and James Harden. , the community correctly predicted a 3-1 week, with 46% of poll responders choosing that option. It was close though, as 39% of fans thought the Dubs would sweep the week, while 12% saw them going 2-2.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cSmEtqI5HCx8KOQFrkcVOy9vG7c=/0x0:2017x3025/1200x800/filters:focal(1024x434:1346x756)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70147253/1148073672.0.jpg,"College Football Expert Picks, Predictions: Week 12 - College Football News

"Booster shots against COVID-19 'are a bit of a distraction,' doctor says - AOL
While COVID-19 booster shot eligibility is continuing to expand in the U.S., not all doctors believe that’s where the focus should be in the fight against the coronavirus.“Honestly, I think that boosters right now are a bit of a distraction away from where we should be focused, which is getting first doses, especially since we know that even now, even with Delta surging, the primary doses of the vaccines are highly protective against serious infection, against hospitalization,” Dr. Anand Swaminathan, a New Jersey-based emergency medicine physician, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).In most states, booster shots are available for those over the age of 65, people with certain underlying medical conditions, and people working in occupations considered to be higher risk in accordance with CDC guidelines.“These boosters will temporarily increase the antibodies that are circulating which then temporarily will improve our effectiveness against fighting COVID in any form,” Swaminathan said. “But it doesn’t really give us the long-term immunity that we’re looking for, doesn’t really boost that as much, or at least we don’t know that it does.""Currently, 58.5% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated while 67.7% have received at least one dose. (13.4% of those who are fully vaccinated have received a booster shot.) As part of an effort to ramp up vaccinations, President Biden recently announced that companies with more than 100 employees will need to require their workers to get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. The requirement is currently blocked by a federal appeals court.This comes as the country recently surpassed 46.6 million coronavirus cases and 755,000 deaths. A report out of Texas found that unvaccinated individuals in the state were 40 times more likely to die from COVID in 2021 than those who were fully vaccinated.But breakthrough cases have become more common due to the virulence of the Delta variant, which is where booster shots come into the conversation. Though extensive details haven't been shared yet, preliminary data from Pfizer indicated that ""receiving an additional booster dose of their COVID-19 vaccine after having had the initial two doses increases the amount of Delta variant antibodies five-fold in 18- to 55-year-olds and 11-fold in 65- to 85-year-olds,"" according to Medical News Today.However, Swaminathan doesn’t think that boosters are “really going to affect very much” for several reasons.“What we’re looking to prevent is the hospitalizations and the serious infections, and we don’t know that boosters really do that,” Swaminathan said. “On top of that, we’ve got some data out of the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that the groups of people that are getting boosters tend to be higher socioeconomic status, they tend to be whiter, they tend to be older.”And with the exception of those who are older, he added, “we’re not really seeing booster uptake being very high in the higher-risk population. So boosters aren’t really getting to those that are higher risk.”Rather than using resources towards distributing booster shots that may not be fully effective, efforts should be directed towards getting first doses in individuals both in the U.S. and around the world, Swaminathan argued.“Right now, the U.S. is administering more boosters than many countries are administering any kind of vaccine, any level of vaccination,” Swaminathan said. “And until we get better vaccine equity globally, we’re not really going to be able to fight this pandemic. We’re going to see more deaths and more dangerous variants.”Adriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

"Paul Rudd’s super nice clapback at New York Post for claiming he didn’t deserve ‘Sexiest Man Alive’ title - Yahoo Entertainment
People magazine's 2021 “Sexiest Man Alive,” Paul Rudd, dropped by  on Monday. The actor received the title last week, and the announcement was mostly met with positive responses from the media and people online.The Guardian ran a headline which read, “Do you fancy Paul Rudd? You're either a sociopath or a liar if you say no.” When Stephen Colbert asked about the headline, Rudd said, “I would like to thank The Guardian, first of all, for hiring my mom.”Many celebrities, like Rudd’s former co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Alicia Silverstone celebrated the announcement on social media. But there were a few outlets which did not agree with the 52-year-old actor receiving the new moniker.About five days before the official announcement was made, Page Six, which is operated by the New York Post, incorrectly claimed Chris Evans would be receiving the title. When they covered the Rudd announcement they wrote the headline, “Sorry, Paul Rudd is many things — but Sexiest Man Alive is not one of them.”“Hey, that might be the first thing I ever read in the New York Post that I agree with,” Rudd said after Colbert shared the information with him. “That’s not fake news.” airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. on CBS.See why 'Voice' contestant has Kelly Clarkson in tears and kicking herself:Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:Tell us what you think!

Alec Baldwin is being made a scapegoat in the fatal ""Rust"" shooting because of political views ... at least according to his brother.Daniel Baldwin appeared Monday on ""The Domenick Nati Show"" ... and during the radio hit, he said his brother should NOT be taking the blame for the fatal incident on set.The way Daniel sees it ... Alec is being scapegoated because he's the big star with outspoken political views, making for an easy target.Daniel says ... ""You know Alec's got the name though doesn't he, so let's go ahead and take Alec for his political views and the many, many wonderful things he's done for different charities and people and his wife and let's see if we can't sensationalize this and go after Alec.""DB adds ... ""This is what he faces because he's opinionated and he's strong-headed and he has really staunch views on certain things and those people who don't like him will take advantage of him and persecute his wife. He's a target.""How very Christian of you. While Daniel doesn't go into Alec's political views, it's no secret Alec did not like Donald Trump, often imitating the former President on 'SNL,' and endorsing Barack Obama back in the day.Remember ... one of the first to publicly pile on Alec was Donald Trump Jr., who posted t-shirts reading, ""Guns don't kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people.""While it seems Don Jr.'s actions support Daniel's scapegoating theory, it's worth noting the District Attorney investigating the case in New Mexico, Mary Carmack-Altwies, is a Democrat.Instead, Daniel says the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is responsible for the death of Halyna Hutchins ... along with assistant director Dave Halls.In Daniel's eyes, Alec is exonerated by the fact folks on set told police Halls announced the gun he handed AB was ""cold,"" meaning it did not have live ammunition.As you know it was a fatal mistake ... the revolver in Alec's hands turned out to have live ammo.Daniel says the buck stops with the armorer, but he's wondering why Halls said it was a ""cold"" gun if Halls didn't verify it ... and he thinks it's clear rules weren't being followed on set.Daniel says Alec really liked Halyna and had spent some time with her family ... and we saw Alec with the family in the wake of the shooting.No charges have been filed and no arrests have been made ... but Daniel believes when the dust settles AB won't be the one going to jail.Bottom line for Daniel ... the actors are just on set to act, and they're not the ones responsible for guns on set.",https://imagez.tmz.com/image/69/4by3/2021/11/16/693b52d974b4450da2be69cfac4347f6_md.jpg
"NASA will spend $93 billion on Artemis moon program by 2025, report estimates - Space.com
Putting boots on the moon is an expensive proposition.NASA's spending on its Artemis program, which aims to establish a sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the decade, is projected to reach a total of $93 billion by 2025, according to a new audit by the NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG).""Moreover, while NASA has several initiatives underway aimed at increasing affordability, we project the current production cost of a single SLS/Orion system to be $4.1 billion per launch,"" the OIG report states, referring to the Orion crew capsule and Space Launch System rocket, which are core Artemis elements.""Looking ahead, without capturing, accurately reporting and reducing the cost of future SLS/Orion missions, the Agency will face significant challenges to sustaining its Artemis program in its current configuration,"" adds the 73-page report, which was released Monday (Nov. 15).For comparison, the U.S. spent $28 billion on NASA's Apollo moon program between 1960 and 1973, . That's about $280 billion in today's dollars.Related:Although the Artemis program was first announced in December 2017, development of Orion and the SLS officially began in 2011. So the OIG report's $93 billion estimate encompasses more than a decade of spending, from fiscal year (FY) 2012 through fiscal year 2025. (On the U.S. government's calendar, fiscal years start on Oct. 1 and end on Sept. 30. FY2012, for example, began on Oct. 1, 2011.)The original plan to return to the moon called for landing astronauts near the moon's south pole for the first time by 2028. In March 2019, however, the administration of President Donald Trump accelerated things, re-targeting the first crewed lunar landing since the Apollo days for 2024 and dubbing the initiative the Artemis program.That revised timeline was widely viewed within the space community as overly ambitious, and NASA is no longer working toward it: Last week, agency chief Bill Nelson announced that the first crewed Artemis landing will likely take place no earlier than 2025.And 2025 may be out of reach as well. The new OIG report, which was apparently written before Nelson's announcement, estimates that NASA will miss the Trump administration's late-2024 landing goal ""by several years."" The audit cites the need to develop and test new Artemis spacesuits, which are behind schedule, and the program's Human Landing System (HLS), which will ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface.In April 2021, NASA selected SpaceX to provide the initial Artemis HLS, which will be a version of the company's huge Starship vehicle. However, two companies that lost out on the HLS contract, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Dynetics, filed protests with the OIG just after the award was announced. Those protests were denied in July, but Blue Origin then filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed earlier this month. So work under the Starship HLS contract is basically just now getting started. —NASA's Artemis program 
— 
—The first crewed Artemis landing mission is called Artemis 3, because it will be the third launch in the program. The first, Artemis 1, will send an uncrewed Orion on a journey around the moon. Artemis 2 will also be a circumlunar mission, but with astronauts aboard. NASA is targeting February 2022 for the launch of Artemis 1. But the OIG report is less bullish, estimating that the mission ""will be ready to launch by summer 2022.""Such Artemis delays have multiple causes, according to the report, from technical challenges to the COVID-19 pandemic to extreme weather events. This past August, for example,  in Louisiana, which builds the core stage for the SLS.In addition, the HLS and another Artemis element, the moon-orbiting space station known as Gateway, received less money from Congress in FY2021 ""than required to meet NASA’s initial acquisition strategy,"" the report notes.The OIG report makes nine recommendations to Jim Free, who as NASA's associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Development (ESD) Mission Directorate is overseeing Artemis. This advice is designed to improve the ""accuracy, transparency and safety of human spaceflight."" The space agency concurred completely or partially with all but two of the recommendations. Those two were ""develop an Artemis-wide cost estimate and update it on an annual basis"" and ""maintain an accounting of per-mission costs and establish a benchmark against which NASA can assess the outcome of initiatives to increase the affordability of ESD systems.""The new audit focuses on the Artemis program's schedule, its projected costs and how NASA's acquisition and programmatic strategies affect the coming moonshot. It was conducted from December 2020 through November 2021, OIG officials said.The new report is the second in a series directly assessing the Artemis program. Over the past five years, however, the OIG and the Government Accountability Office have released 21 reports ""of significant relevance to the subject of this report,"" the audit states.Mike Wall is the author of ""Out There"" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), a book about the search for alien life.

You can see the longest partial lunar eclipse in hundreds of years this week.The “nearly total” lunar eclipse is expected overnight Thursday, Nov. 18, to Friday, Nov. 19, NASA said.“The Moon will be so close to opposite the Sun on Nov 19 that it will pass through the southern part of the shadow of the Earth for a nearly total lunar eclipse,” NASA said on its website.The eclipse will last 3 hours, 28 minutes and 23 seconds, making it the longest in centuries, Space.com reported.Only a small sliver of the moon will be visible during the eclipse. About 97% of the moon will disappear into Earth’s shadow as the sun and moon pass opposite sides of the planet, EarthSky reported.The moon should appear to be a reddish-brown color as it slips into the shadow, NASA reported.The eclipse will be visible in many parts of the world, including North America, eastern Australia, New Zealand and Japan, according to EarthSky.“For U.S. East Coast observers, the partial eclipse begins a little after 2 a.m., reaching its maximum at 4 in the morning,” NASA reported. “For observers on the West Coast, that translates to beginning just after 11 p.m., with a maximum at 1 a.m.”You can check what time is best to watch the eclipse in your town on timeanddate.com.-----2021 The Charlotte Observer.

Within a diamond hauled from deep beneath Earth's surface, scientists have discovered the first example of a never-before-seen mineral.Named davemaoite after prominent geophysicist Ho-kwang (Dave) Mao, the mineral is the first example of a high-pressure calcium silicate perovskite (CaSiO3) found on Earth. Another form of CaSiO3, known as wollastonite, is commonly found across the globe, but davemaoite has a crystalline structure that forms only under high pressure and high temperatures in Earth's mantle, the mainly solid layer of Earth trapped between the outer core and the crust.Davemaoite has long been expected to be an abundant and geochemically important mineral in Earth's mantle. But scientists have never found any direct evidence of its existence because it breaks down into other minerals when it moves toward the surface and pressure decreases. However, analysis of a diamond from Botswana, which formed in the mantle around 410 miles (660 kilometers) below Earth's surface, has revealed a sample of intact davemaoite trapped inside. As a result, the International Mineralogical Association has now confirmed davemaoite as a new mineral.Related: ""The discovery of davemaoite came as a surprise,"" lead author Oliver Tschauner, a mineralogist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told Live Science. Tschauner and his colleagues uncovered the davemaoite sample with a technique known as synchrotron X-ray diffraction, which focuses a high-energy beam of X-rays on certain spots within the diamond with microscopic precision. By measuring the angle and intensity of the returning light, researchers can decipher what's inside, Tschauner said. The sample of davemaoite within the diamond was just a few micrometers (millionths of a meter) in size, so less-powerful sampling techniques would have missed it, he added.Davemaoite is believed to play an important geochemical role in Earth's mantle. Scientists theorize that the mineral may also contain other trace elements, including uranium and thorium, which release heat via radioactive decay. Therefore, davemaoite may help to generate a substantial amount of heat in the mantle, Tschauner said.In a 2014 study published in the journal Science, researchers described another theoretical high-pressure mineral from the mantle, known as bridgmanite. However, the sample of bridgmanite did not originate from the mantle but rather inside a meteorite. The discovery of davemaoite shows that diamonds can form farther down in the mantle than previously thought, and it suggests that they might be the best place to look for more new minerals from the mantle, Tschauner said.———""The work by Tschauner et al. inspires hope in the discovery of other difficult high-pressure phases in nature,"" Yingwei Fe, a geophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the study, said in a related Science article. ""Such direct sampling of the inaccessible lower mantle would fill our knowledge gap in chemical composition of the entire mantle of our planet.""The study was published online Nov. 11 in the journal Science.Originally published on Live Science. to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

It might be hotter than lava but superionic ice is not on fire. Image Credit: Stewart Scott/Shutterstock.comIf you think of very low temperatures, there's a good chance you are picturing ice. Ice is a quintessential ""cold"" thing for us. But at extreme pressures, like in the core of large planets, something peculiar can happen. Ice can remain solid but have a temperature hotter than the surface of the Sun.This type of water ice is called ""superionic ice"" and has been added to the list of around 20 phases water can structurally form, including ice, liquid, and vapor. Now, researchers report in Nature Physics the discovery and characterization of two superionic ice phases, having found a way of reliably and stably recreating the ice for longer than has previously been achieved to be able to study it. One superionic phase extends between 200,000 and 600,00 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level and at a temperature of several hundred to over 1,000°C. The other phase extends to half the pressure experienced at the center of the Earth and with temperatures of thousands of degrees.“It was a surprise — everyone thought this phase wouldn’t appear until you are at much higher pressures than where we first find it,” co-author Vitali Prakapenka, a University of Chicago research professor and beamline scientist at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory, said in a statement. “But we were able to very accurately map the properties of this new ice, which constitutes a new phase of matter, thanks to several powerful tools.”At higher temperatures and incredible pressures, the ice remains solid but the atomic structure is dramatically shifted. Once the pressure and temperature are removed though, the ice return to its regular state.“Imagine a cube, a lattice with oxygen atoms at the corners connected by hydrogen,” Prakapenka said. “When it transforms into this new superionic phase, the lattice expands, allowing the hydrogen atoms to migrate around while the oxygen atoms remain steady in their positions. It’s kind of like a solid oxygen lattice sitting in an ocean of floating hydrogen atoms.”Superionic ice is less dense than regular ice, which we know already to be less dense than liquid water. It also changes color. While water ice can be transparent to cloudy white, depending on how it freezes, superionic ice is darker as it interacts with light differently.“It’s a new state of matter, so it basically acts as a new material, and it may be different from what we thought,” Prakapenka said.Planetary scientists believe similar extreme conditions in pressure and temperatures might exist inside Neptune and Uranus, as well as other ice giant planets beyond the Solar System. Understanding the properties of superionic ice might help us understand the properties of these planets.This website uses cookiesThis website uses cookies to improve user experience.

Austria has placed some 2 million unvaccinated people on partial lockdown, while neighboring Germany has reintroduced free coronavirus testing, as the two countries contend with soaring rates of COVID-19 amid a Europe-wide wave of new infections.Unvaccinated people in Austria will be allowed to leave their homes only for work, food shopping or emergencies, according to the new mandate beginning Monday. Police are conducting spot checks of digital vaccine certificates, though there's skepticism about how effectively the lockdown can be enforced.""We really didn't take this step lightly, and I don't think it should be talked down,"" Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told Ö1 radio, which called the move a dramatic step. ""What we are trying is precisely to reduce contact between the unvaccinated and vaccinated to a minimum, and also contact between the unvaccinated,"" Schallenberg said.The measures are expected to remain in place for 10 days. Nearly 12,000 people have died since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the country of 9 million.As Germany battles its worst infection rate since the pandemic began, a similar lockdown has been imposed in the capital, Berlin, with only people who are fully vaccinated or who recently recovered from COVID-19 allowed to enter restaurants, cinemas and sports facilities. The federal government is also reversing course only a month after saying it would no longer provide free coronavirus testing.While Germany, at 68%, and Austria, at 65%, outpace the U.S. in the percentage of the , they are somewhat behind some of their fellow EU members, as well as the United Kingdom.""Our vaccination rate is still under 75% of the German population,"" said Dr. Christine Falk, president of the German Society for Immunology, according to Deutsche Welle. ""Combined with the lack of contact restrictions, this is allowing the virus to spread almost exclusively among the unvaccinated.""Germany has recorded about 98,000 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic.Meanwhile, the Netherlands on Saturday night imposed a partial lockdown that is set to remain in place for at least three weeks, amid a surge in COVID-19 cases that have put a severe strain on Dutch hospitals. The measures will limit hours for bars, restaurants and supermarkets. There is also a limit of four guests per household, and spectators are once again banned from sporting events.The measures, announced by acting Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday, angered some Dutch youth, hundreds of whom took to the streets on Saturday night in the northern city of Leeuwarden, where they set off fireworks before being pushed out of a central square by police, broadcaster NOS reported, according to The Associated Press.Despite a vaccination rate of nearly 85% of the adult population in the Netherlands, the country recorded a record number of new infections on Thursday — more than 16,000.COVID-19 has killed more than 18,600 people in the country since the start of the pandemic.",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/11/15/gettyimages-1236580157-cf3f893a73321fb0428e8136345272e14e4cd45e-s1100-c50.jpg,"Talking Trikots: Top 5 Germany kits of the past decade - Bavarian Football Works
Welcome back to Talking Trikots! Just like Bayern Munich, we’ve taken a bit of a break, but that shouldn’t last too long. The final international break of 2021 has come to a close, and 2021 has served up many stories for the German national team as per usual, from the debacle against North Macedonia in March, the partially-successful-but-also-disappointing European Championship, and the possible redemption under Hansi Flick in the latter months.Whatever phase they’re going through, though, Germany’s kits have always looked pretty sharp, unlike Bayern’s, which have been hit or miss. Here are the top five kits from the past decade of German football, which will bring back quite a few memories, good or bad.Okay, some people might raise a fair few eyebrows at this entry. I mean, really? A 13-striped shirt? We’re Germans, not zebras. But hear me out. This is one of those kits that grows on you. It’s a unique look, one that has never been attempted before. Of course, that doesn’t always mean that it’s good, but this time, it’s not too bad. It’s pretty fashionable (who doesn’t love horizontal stripes?), it’s something that you could easily wear on the street as well as on the pitch, and it looks pretty dapper. It’s a lot better than people will say it is. The German national colors on the sleeves definitely help.The kit’s record isn’t too pretty, and that’s probably part of the reason why it gets slated so much. The aforementioned reverse to North Macedonia, not to mention the 0-6 drubbing to Spain all happened in this shirt. But on the flip side, it’s also a kit of redemption. Hansi Flick’s new Germany recorded a darn near perfect World Cup qualification campaign in this kit, all the while slowly but surely turning the decrepit German train wreck into a full-steam-ahead locomotive. Whether Flick’s Germany will be as successful in the coming months remains to be seen, but he certainly has shed a new light on the jersey. Plus, we’ll always have that win over Portugal at the Euros.#4. 2011/13 HomeThis is probably the least complex looking kit on our list. But sometimes, simple wins. The kit is a clean white, with no other major detail other than three thin lines diagonally crossing the shirt. You guessed it, those three lines are in the colors of the German flag. Man, it must be good to have a flag that’s so flexible in terms of design. It’s a crisp, clean look that’s subtle, yet also sends a strong message out that “this is Germany’s kit.” There’s a little gray area between too little and too much when it comes to football kits, but this kit just manages to stay in that gray area, and it looks fantastic.The kit was worn during Germany’s semifinal run in the 2012 European Championship, and also during the qualification campaign for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Notable results include the 1-0 and 2-1 wins over Portugal and the Netherlands at the Euros, a 6-1 away win to Northern Ireland during the World Cup qualifiers, and, on a slightly sour note, a 4-4 draw with Sweden that thankfully did not have a negative effect on the rest of the qualifiers.#3. 2021/22 AwayI think we can all agree that Germany looks pretty decent in black. No, scratch that, football teams in general look pretty good in black. No, say again, almost everyone looks good in black. This year, adidas delivered the goods with the first all black kit in the past ten years(more on that later). The shirt is jet black. Logos, stripes, everything is black. One could make an argument for metallic gray for the highlights, but whatever it is, it looks stunning. The only other colors on the shirt are on the sleeves, which are adorned with the national colors just like the home kit. I’m a sucker for subtle details that stand out like this, and this one just looks so good. It tells you that it’s a Germany jersey, but it could also pass as a very fashionable streetwear item, because again, who doesn’t look good in black? Monochromatic black as well. It just looks so sleek and sexy, it should be on a fashion runway as well as a football pitch. Heck, I’m wearing it as I write this.The kit hasn’t been worn too many times, but it already has a good memory to its name. Remember that last gasp draw against Hungary at the Euros that propelled Germany from bottom of the group to the round of 16? Yes, this shirt was worn then. I still remember celebrating Leon Goretzka’s dramatic equalizer. Funnily enough, Goretzka also scored Germany’s maiden goal in this shirt, in a 3-0 win over Iceland back in March.#2. 2014/15 Home and AwayI tried putting these two entries separately, but I just couldn’t, they’re equally beautiful and they both hold such a special place in every Germany fan’s heart. So let’s get into both of them at the same time.We’ll start with the home kit, which hangs proudly on my wall. It has a massive chevron V-shape on the chest, colored in different shades of red that allow it to resemble the German flag. The design makes one look like a superhero when wearing it. It may not be the most subtle design on this list, but it’s definitely something that stands out in a good way. The red also adorns the collar and the sleeves, which is a good sign for us Bayern fans. Now here’s an interesting detail that might go unnoticed at first glance: sandwiching the red chevron are two very thin lines of black and gold. What’s black, red and gold altogether? You guessed it, the German flag. Now that’s subtlety at its finest, and I love it.The away kit is red and black, with white/silver details. Large horizontal blocks of red and black decorate the shirt, which apparently took inspiration from Brazilian club CR Flamengo(where Bayern alum Rafinha used to play). It’s a bold look that also utilizes the German national colors very well. All that’s missing is the gold, but it’s still a cool looking shirt. Again, horizontal stripes can be very fashionable, and this shirt is no exception. There’s no jarring pattern or abstract design, just thick streaks of color that are eye-catching and stunning.These two kits were worn at the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The away kit was worn in two games, in the final group game against the USA, and the infamous 7-1 victory over hosts Brazil in the semifinals. The home kit was worn in the other five games, which included a resounding opening win over Portugal, a hard-fought win over France in the quarterfinals, and of course, the crowning victory over Argentina in the final. These are some historic kits, both by design and by record.#1. 2010/11 AwayGermany has had a lot of great kits over the years, but this one really takes the cake. It’s black, which makes it hard to fail already, but its details are gold, which just makes it nearly perfect. We all know how well black and gold go together, just look at Bayern’s current away kit. This shirt takes the two colors and makes them starkly contrast against each other, making for a look that both pulls you in and flashes back at you simultaneously. Gold numbers and logos adorn the shirt, and there’s also a touch of red here and there, on the collar and in thin lines down the length of the shirt. So again, there’s our German national colors. It’s a look that stands out and also sends a clear statement: “we’re not here to mess around, we’re focused on the task at hand, and we’re going to win.” And win indeed they did. The kit was mainly worn in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in three games, and Germany won all three. It was first worn in the final group game against Ghana, then the quarterfinal against Argentina, and finally in the third place playoff against Uruguay. Germany scored a total of eight goals in those three games and conceded only two. Now that’s a strong record for a jersey.I remember my first ever Germany game, that 4-0 win over Argentina. It was a shocking experience to watch those Germans clad in black, dismantling an Argentina side that had been one of the favorites for the tournament without any sort of mercy or doubt. Those kits were permanently burned into my eyes after that match, and to this day, they remain the most memorable kits that the German national team has ever suited up in, for me at least.So there you have it! What’s your favorite Germany kit, and which ones did we miss?
