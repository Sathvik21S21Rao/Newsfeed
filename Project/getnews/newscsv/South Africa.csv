"Orlando Pirates player ratings against Kaizer Chiefs: Motshwari struggles, Peprah dazzles - Goal.com
Well-beaten by Reeve Frosler's powerful long-range shot.Mpontshane should have done better when Erick Mathoho scored at the near-post, but he did make some important saves including one from Keagan Dolly's curling shot.Disappointing day at the office.Shandu was kept silent by Chiefs' pressing and couldn't make his usual overlapping runs.Given all sorts of headaches by Dolly.Mako also looked sloppy in possession too and rarely pushed forward as he was most concerned with Chiefs' quick counterattacks.Pirates' best defender on the day.Ndah won both his ground and aerial battles which saw him come close to scoring when his header hit the upright.Captained the team in the absence of Happy Jele.Nyauza stood tall in the face of Chiefs' onslaught - forcing the visitors to attack through the wings, but he was eclipsed by his central defensive partner, Ndah.Couldn't cope with Amakhosi's pressure in the first half.However, Monare improved after the restart following Abel Mabaso's introduction as the former began carrying the team forward and he provided the assist for Bucs' consolation goal.Arguably his worst performance in Bucs colours.Motshwari was overpowered by Amakhosi's midfielders, negating his impact and he was caught out of position when Frosler scored. Unsurprisingly substituted at half-time.Started brightly, before he faded away after the restart.Dlamini dropped deep into pockets of space and created chances for his teammates, but he was substituted after the restart while looking tired.A live wire in Bucs' right flank.Lorch was menacing with his penetrative runs and he delivered some decent crosses, but chances didn't fall for him in the box.Had his moments against Njabulo Blom in the left flank.Hotto made some good dribbles to get forward, but his final product was poor on the day.A constant threat to the Amakhosi backline.Peprah caused the visitors problems with his movement - taking shots from all angles before he turned home Monare's cross to grab Pirates' only goal of the match.Came on at half-time and he flourished in his role as a holding midfielder - winning back possession and distributing the ball with aplomb. Introduced with 13 minutes left and he didn't come to grips with the game much.Couldn't make an impact as he came on in the 86th minute.Completely inconspicuous having come on in the 90th minute.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltcc7a7ffd2fbf71f5/blt4ddcb038b55e42c3/6223a3da218f487d03c96865/B21LWSM0127.JPG?auto=webp&format=jpg&quality=60&width=190,"Maritzburg stun Sundowns for first league win over the Brazilians in a decade - TimesLIVE
Mamelodi Sundowns suffered a shock 2-1 loss to Maritzburg United during their drama filled DStv Premiership clash at the Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday night.In what turned out to be their first league win over Sundown in more than a decade, Maritzburg needed a successful last gasp penalty by substitute attacker Amadou Soukouna.When Soukouna beat Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene for what turned out to be the winner, Sundowns midfielder Themba Zwane had been denied from the spot by Maritzburg goalkeeper Marcel Engelhardt minutes earlier.Before the drama of the two penalties occurred in the closing stages, they were tied 1-1 after first half goals by Peter Shalulile and Alfred Ndengane.Though they dropped all the away points, the Brazilians still enjoys a healthy 16-point lead over second-placed Kaizer Chefs who beat Orlando Pirates in the Soweto derby earlier in the day.On the other, Maritzburg United coach Ernst Middendorp will be relieved as this victory keeps them above the relegation zone with 21 points from as many outings.From this defeat, their second of the season so far this league campaign, Sundowns will turn their attention to the Nedbank Cup last 16 on Tuesday afternoon where they host amateur side Mathaithai at the Lucas Moripe Stadium.Sundowns were playing in their fifth consecutive away match in all competitions following trips to TS Galaxy in Mbombela, Al Ahly and Al-Merreikh in Egypt and Baroka in Polokwane.The opening goal arrived after 36 minutes from the clever effort of Namibian hitman Shalulile who dropped down to beat Engelhardt after he connected with a delivery from Haashim Domingo.The opener turned out to be Shalulile’s second goal in as many matches as he continues to recover from a recent goal drought that saw him go five matches without kissing the back of the net recently.It was also Shalulile’s 15th goal of the season to match the number he scored the whole of last season where ended up as the team’s highest scorer and the second best in the league.Sundowns’ lead did not last long as Maritzburg equalised four minutes later from a towering header by Ndengane who was at the end of a well-taken corner kick by Keegan Ritchie.The equaliser stood but television replays showed that referee Thando Ndzandzeka missed an infringement by Ndengane who was climbing on top of Sundowns defender Thapelo Morena when he headed home.Then came the drama of penalties.First, Nazeer Allie handled in the box under pressure from Neo Maema to concede a penalty but Engelhardt came to his rescue as he dived the right way to deny Zwane.There was more drama as Sundowns Mweene hacked Soukouna in the box and the substitute attacker stood up to ensure this famous victory for Maritzburg.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Mokoka breaks world 50km record with 2:40:13 in Gqeberha | REPORTS - World Athletics
Stephen Mokoka breaks the world record in the Nedbank #Runified 50km ( Tobias Ginsberg / organisers)South Africa’s Stephen Mokoka stepped up to 50km in style on Sunday (6), running 2:40:13* to break the men’s world record for the distance at the Nedbank #Runified 50km – a World Athletics Elite Label road race – in Gqeberha.The three-time Olympian has been running marathons for more than a decade but made history in his very first 50km race, following the pacemaker through half way in 1:21:03 and then breaking away after 35km (1:52:53) with a 2:56 kilometre to put himself on world record schedule.The 2019 world marathon fifth-placer finisher held that pace on the 10km loop course, running a negative split (1:19:10 for the second half) after a solo run to victory. He won by almost four minutes and improved the inaugural world 50km record of 2:42:07 that had been set by Ethiopia’s Ketema Negasa at the same event last year.""I’m tired,"" Mokoka said with a smile in his post-race interview. ""It’s a long way and I don’t know how I’m going to feel later, but I enjoyed it.""The performance further demonstrates Mokoka's impressive range. The 37-year-old has claimed numerous national titles in his career so far, from 1500m up to the marathon. His marathon best is 2:07:40 from Shanghai in 2015, while he set the South African half marathon record when running 59:36 to place seventh at the 2020 World Half Marathon Championships in Gdynia.Tete Dijana was runner-up to Mokoka in Gqeberha, clocking 2:44:08, with their compatriot Edward Mothibi – the 2019 Comrades Marathon winner – third in 2:45:27.Given the increasing popularity of 50km road races, the decision to add the distance to the list of events for which world records are recognised was made at the World Athletics Council meeting in Tokyo in July. Negasa’s 2:42:07 was then ratified as the inaugural men’s world 50km record at the start of this year, while the 3:04:24 run by South Africa’s Irvette van Zyl in the same 2021 event was ratified as the world 50km record for a women-only race.That time had been the target for athletes in Sunday’s Nedbank #Runified 50km and the women's field went off with intent, the leaders passing 10km in 35:51 and half way in 1:31:34. Amelework Fikadu Bosho celebrates her Nedbank #Runified 50km win ( Tobias Ginsberg / organisers)Ethiopia’s Amelework Fikadu Bosho later dropped her rivals and although she was not able to maintain that world record pace, she hung on for a dominant women’s race win in 3:04:58.Kenya’s Shelmith Muriuki was second in 3:08:30, while Van Zyl was third in 3:13:23.*Subject to the usual ratification procedure Sabastian Kimaru Sawe ran the eighth-fastest half marathon in history at the RomaOstia event on Sunday (6), clocking 58:02 at the World Athletics Label road race.

She went on to clock 30:58 for the first 10km which is on a slightly uphill section of the course. It was a lead she wouldn’t relinquish and she eventually finished more than a minute ahead of Mehamed, who ran 1:07:09. Ethiopia’s 2017 world marathon fifth-place finisher Shure Demise was third in 1:08:17, while USA’s Allie Kieffer finished fourth in a PB of 1:09:17 and Tanzania’s Failuna Matanga was also inside 70 minutes with 1:09:35.( Alfredo Falcone / LaPresse)Sawe also ran a strong first half to assert his dominance and went through the 10km mark in 28:01, pushing on to win clearly ahead of Great Ethiopian Run winner Gemechu Dida in a PB of 59:21, plus Kenya’s Leonard Langat (59:22), Moses Koech (59:31), Moses Kemei (59:46), Sila Kiptoo (59:56) and Paul Tiongik (1:00:01).

A researcher's modelling exercise has underscored a glaring gap in Omicron infection risk between the boosted and unvaccinated – something now also being illustrated by hospital cases.In a new analysis, postdoctoral researcher Dr Leighton Watson used what's called a stochastic model to simulate the potential numbers of new infections a person could cause based on their vaccination status.His model worked by simulating outbreaks of both Delta and Omicron, beginning with a hypothetical infection seeded by someone either unvaccinated, double-jabbed or boosted – and then running it 100,000 times.Watson said Delta was the dominant variant when New Zealand's traffic light system was introduced, and it relied upon high vaccination rates to reduce spread.""With the emergence of Omicron in the community in January, and evidence from overseas suggesting that the vaccine was less effective at preventing infection, I was interested in how this would impact New Zealand under the Covid-19 Protection Framework.""Overseas evidence has indicated that two doses of the Pfizer shot alone weren't very effective at stopping infection with Omicron – especially if many months had passed since the second dose was given.While the third Pfizer dose could boost immunity significantly, Watson said the vaccine's lower performance against Omicron had led some people to believe that the vaccinated and unvaccinated were equally likely to spread the virus – and that mandates should therefore be scrapped.That prompted him to explore what that comparative risk might look like.""This is information that is relatively simple to get from a mathematical model, but almost impossible to determine from real data, as it is so hard to know where and who someone got infected from - especially with skyrocketing case numbers.""His model indicated that, despite accounting for just around two in 10 of all Kiwis, the unvaccinated were responsible for 45% of all new Omicron infections, compared with 39% for those with two doses, and 15% for boosted people.Overall, the model calculated that, when compared with boosted people, unvaccinated people were 3.1 times more likely to infect others and 2.4 times more likely to be infected.""More interestingly, transmission from boosted-to-boosted people is only responsible for three% of new infections, when normalised by population,"" Watson said.""So, while the vaccine provides imperfect protection against infection and transmission on an individual level for Omicron, the cumulative effect of that imperfect protection results in good protection at the population level.""While Omicron typically involved less severe illness than Delta, Watson said soaring case counts were resulting in disruption to businesses and supply chains, as well as much higher numbers of hospitalisations than we have previously seen in New Zealand.""Not only does this impact the people who are sick in hospital with Covid, it has flow on effects with the postponement of 'non-urgent' care,"" he said.""This work further demonstrates that getting boosted is important to slow the spread of Covid-19, prevent people from getting infected with Covid-19 and passing it on to friends and whanau, and help our health system cope under the onslaught of Omicron.""Rather than whether mandates should apply, Watson felt his model raised the issue of what it meant to be ""fully vaccinated"", given it suggested only a minor difference in infection between those who'd received two doses more than 15 weeks ago, and those who'd had none at all.""Should being 'boosted' be required to be considered 'fully vaccinated', as being boosted is significantly more effective against infection and transmission than two doses?""Watson stressed that his modelling came with some notable limitations and caveats.Importantly, it didn't account for age, ethnicity and socio-economic status – nor did it model disease severity or hospitalisation risk.As well, it assumed that a person in his hypothetical population would be just as likely to interact with any other, regardless of their vaccination status.Professor Michael Plank, of Covid-19 Modelling Aotearoa, said accounting for age, especially, mattered when assessing infection risk in New Zealand.""What we have at the moment is higher booster coverage in older age groups, but lower coverage in young people,"" he said.""That we have lower coverage in younger age groups matters, because they are the groups where most of the cases and transmission is happening.""That all reinforces the point that it's important to get boosted even if you're at lower risk, because the booster can cut transmission rates – particularly in those younger age groups.""Meanwhile, he said this Omicron outbreak was demonstrating the headline point of Watson's modelling: that the unvaccinated stood at much higher risk.""The clearest trend we see now is that there's a lot more unvaccinated people ending up in hospital, compared to their proportion of the population.""Of cases in Northern Region hospitals reported as at Saturday, around 18.2% were unvaccinated or uneligible, 2.4% were partially immunised, 39.1% were were double-vaccinated and 20.2% were boosted. The vaccination status of 20.1% of the remaining cases was unknown.Also as at Saturday, 95.2% of the eligible population over 12 had received at least two doses, 96.6% had received a single jab and 72.3% were boosted.Of 202,375 cases reported since the start of the Delta outbreak in August, there'd been 191 hospitalisations among 51,444 confirmed cases who'd been boosted at least seven days beforehand, compared with 559 hospitalisations among 11,650 confirmed unvaccinated cases.We are the South's eyes and ears in crucial council meetings, at court hearings, on the sidelines of sporting events and on the frontline of breaking news.As our region faces uncharted waters in the wake of a global pandemic, Otago Daily Times continues to bring you local stories that matter.We employ local journalists and photographers to tell your stories, as other outlets cut local coverage in favour of stories told out of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.You can help us continue to bring you local news you can trust by becoming a supporter.",https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/styles/odt_landscape_extra_large_4_3/public/story/2022/03/coronavirusvaccineillustrationgettyimages-1301752656.jpg?itok=1eZiOBla,"Enugu, Osun, Katsina, five other states record measles outbreak - TDPel Media

During a three-week stretch at the height of this winter’s devastating omicron case surge, Santa Cruz County health officials lost 10 patients to COVID-19. All but one were vaccinated, and five had received booster shots.As the omicron wave recedes, California data reveal an unsettling trend. Compared to the delta variant case surge last summer, deaths among the vaccinated rose sharply with omicron, a variant said by many experts to cause milder illness.A Bay Area News Group analysis of state COVID-19 deaths found that in the four deadliest weeks of the delta and omicron surges, the number of unvaccinated people who died were nearly identical, and far higher than the totals for the vaccinated. Even so, three times more vaccinated people died during the omicron peak than during delta’s heyday.“We’ve seen some chinks in the armor of vaccines that we didn’t see before,” said Santa Cruz County Deputy Health Officer Dr. David Ghilarducci. “As good as the vaccines are, they’re not 100% protection.”More breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths among the vaccinated have added to the challenges Ghilarducci and other public health officials face as they continue urging vaccination as the most effective defense against the virus, including variants like omicron.“When I first saw that,” Ghilarducci recalled of the 10 Santa Cruz County COVID-19 patients who died from Jan.16 to Feb. 10, “I thought, ‘Oh no, what’s going on here?'”It turned out the tragic outcomes in Santa Cruz County weren’t quite as alarming as the numbers suggested. Of the vaccinated patients who died, one was in his early 100s, three were in their 90s, two were in their 80s, three were in their 70s and most had underlying health problems. The unvaccinated man who died was in his 50s.State figures have consistently shown the coronavirus is deadlier with age. Of the nearly 85,000 Californians who’ve died of COVID-19, 71% were age 65 or older and 92% at were least 50.But state data also show that string of Santa Cruz County deaths among vaccinated residents wasn’t a fluke.From Aug. 25 to Sept. 21, the deadliest four weeks of the delta surge when the variant accounted for 98% or more of genetically sequenced cases, 2,917 unvaccinated and 533 vaccinated people died.From Jan. 14 to Feb. 10, the deadliest period of the omicron surge when the variant was 98% or more of sequenced cases, 2,999 unvaccinated and 1,767 vaccinated people died, including 436 who’d received booster shots to shore up waning vaccine protection.Dr. George Rutherford, an infectious disease expert at UC-San Francisco, said the raw numbers make the deaths among the vaccinated look worse than they are — their rates of dying remain far less than the unvaccinated. Even the United Kingdom’s 95-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, who tested positive for the virus last month and is reported to be vaccinated and boosted, has only mild cold-like symptoms.That is true. But the advantage for vaccinated and boosted people dropped dramatically with omicron. On Nov. 1, the seven-day average deaths per million among unvaccinated people were 38 times higher than for those who are vaccinated. But state figures show  for unvaccinated people are only 17 times higher now than for the vaccinated and boosted.What explains the shift? Dr. Errol Ozdalga, a hospitalist at Stanford who has been caring for COVID-19 patients throughout the pandemic, said omicron brought a wave of immunocompromised people to the hospital infected with the virus, many of them vaccinated, unlike anything he’d seen before. With delta, and earlier infection waves before vaccines were widely available, many of those who were admitted were otherwise healthy.“That went away with omicron,” Ozdalga said. The variant has afflicted those with weakened immune systems, those who were “predisposed in some way” to severe illness, he said.That doesn’t mean omicron is deadlier than first believed. But far more people were getting sick during the peak of the omicron surge in January, when state figures show more than 100,000 new cases were being detected daily.By comparison, during the delta peak last summer, fewer than 25,000 people were testing positive daily. During the first winter case surge of 2020-2021, daily new cases neared 50,000. Average daily deaths peaked in the winter of 2020-2021 at over 500, during delta daily deaths peaked at nearly 140, and the most recent data on omicron suggests daily deaths peaked at just over 200 in early February.Dr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases and vaccinology at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health, said the sheer number of infections from fast-spreading omicron led to more deaths.“There were more cases at the peak of omicron than with the peak of delta plus the peak of the previous year and then some,” Swartzberg said.Ghilarducci said that unlike delta and earlier variants that caused severe infection deep in the lungs, omicron tends to cause upper respiratory illness more like a cold. But for the aged and vulnerable, that still can be too much for them. And Swartzberg added that omicron “is still a serious infection,” worse than the flu, and more capable of evading the vaccines’ protection than earlier variants.Ghilarducci noted that as rates of vaccinations rise, there are fewer unvaccinated people left to infect. More than 70% of all Californians have now gotten the shots, up from 56% Sept. 1. And Santa Clara County Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody noted that vaccination rates are higher among older people, so those who are more at risk to begin with also are more likely to be vaccinated. But as the omicron experience shows, especially for older people, vaccination isn’t always enough.Related Articles









That was among the reasons Cody maintained indoor masking requirements longer than the state and other counties, lifting them Wednesday.“The message that is getting lost a little bit is that masking is still strongly recommended in California,” Cody said.Health experts say the bottom line, as omicron recedes, is people shouldn’t be complacent, particularly if they’re older and at higher risk. The virus is still out there, and despite omicron’s ability to evade protective measures in some cases, vaccines remain the best line of defense.“We have powerful vaccines,” Ghilarducci said, “that continue to be very effective.”",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2

"Curiosity Rover Spots a 'Mineral Flower' On Mars - Review Geek
NASA’s Curiosity rover landed on Mars way back in 2012, and it’s still rolling around, capturing new images all the time. At the end of February, the little rover spotted a tiny ‘flower’ on the martian planet roughly the size of a penny.While this isn’t an actual flower and more of a flower-shaped mineral deposit, it’s still an exciting discovery. According to NASA, it looks like a small coral or sponge and is likely a branching rock formed when the planet was still covered with water long ago.Curiosity snapped an image of the little rock pile on February 24 or 25th using the Mars Hand Lens Imager, a camera located on the end of its robotic arm. It’s located near Aeolis Mons, also known as Mount Sharp, near the center of the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater, where Curiosity has spent countless years roaming the surface.NASA says the crater could once have been a lake, and all the moisture would help form these odd formations and flower-like deposits. Some of NASA’s other exploratory devices have captured similar interesting images, such as these blueberry-shaped rocks in 2004.Curiosity has taken many photos on its long journey, shaping our understanding of what Mars’ surface looks like. For those wondering, Curiosity is nearing the end of its journey and has roamed the red planet for roughly ten years so far. Unfortunately, scientists say that its nuclear power system was only meant to last 14 years, so we’re not sure how many more photos we’ll get like this last one.That’s okay though because Perseverance Rover is there to keep exploring.via Live Science",https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2022/03/19a34368.jpg?width=1200,"A Dead Rocket Just Crashed Into the Moon, and Scientists Are Thrilled - CNET
A natural impact on the moon created this crater in 2013. It's about to get another. The impact took place on the far side of the moon out of view of any telescopes or spacecraft, but NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will be in a position to start taking photos of the impact site in mid-March.   Modeling software company AGI developed this animation of how the crash may have appeared from a point above the moon. Bill Gray, an amateur astronomer and software developer in Maine, first noticed the terminal trajectory. His software picked up the impact in an orbital model and Gray worked with observatories around the world to gather additional data and increase his confidence in the prediction. Gray believes he misidentified the booster as a Falcon 9 years ago. He and other researchers since confirmed it to be the Chinese rocket part instead. ""I am astounded that we can tell the difference between the two rocket body options -- SpaceX versus Chinese -- and confirm which one will impact the moon with the data we have,""  in a statement in February. ""The differences we see are primarily due to type of paint used by SpaceX and the Chinese.""So the rocket about to hit the Moon, it turns out, is not the one we thought it was. This (an honest mistake) just emphasizes the problem with lack of proper  tracking of these deep space objects. https://t.co/JXKpUmEC2XThe rocket crashed into the lunar surface in a crater named Hertzsprung that's a little larger than the state of Iowa. The location is remote enough that the impact doesn't pose any threat to the Apollo mission or other space program landing sites. ""(The) rocket impact will provide a fortuitous experiment that could reveal a lot about how natural collisions pummel and scour planetary surfaces,"" University of Colorado Boulder planetary scientist Paul Hayne wrote for The Conversation. ""A deeper understanding of impact physics will go a long way in helping researchers interpret the barren landscape of the Moon and also the effects impacts have on Earth and other planets.""Hayne expects the impact obliterated the rocket instantly, creating a white flash that could be visible if any spacecraft were in place with a vantage point. ""It will be the moon's newest archaeological site,"" . ""We'll learn something about the geology of the location from the color differences and distribution of the ejected material. It's an opportunity to learn more about the moon's mysterious far side.""Besides adding a new feature to the dark side of the moon, there's some concern it could also introduce tiny hitchhikers to our natural satellite. ""So I'm not bothered by one more crater being made on the moon,""  in The Conversation. ""It already has something like half a billion craters that are 10 meters or more in diameter. What we should worry about is contaminating the moon with living microbes, or molecules that could in the future be mistaken as evidence of former life on the moon.""The  last month raising its concern that not enough is being done to track space junk, as NASA and others hope to establish a permanent presence on the moon.""The upcoming lunar impact illustrates well the need for a comprehensive regulatory regime in space, not only for the economically crucial orbits around Earth but also applying to the moon,"" said Holger Krag, head of ESA's space safety program.This isn't the first time a spacecraft has slammed into the moon, although Gray thinks it might be the first time it's happening unintentionally. As recently as 2009,  in a search for water (it found some). ""In essence,"" Gray says, ""this is a 'free' Lcross.""  ",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/PbpCmgvOHgQuj-qmRDx7SdRHtus=/84x84/2011/10/17/73f135f8-8d74-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/headshots_Erick_Mack_140x100.jpg,"China wants its new rocket for astronaut launches to be reusable - Space.com
China is planning for its next-generation crew launch vehicle for missions to its space station and the moon to have a reusable first stage.The new rocket would allow a reusable launch option for sending astronauts or cargo to China's new Tiangong space station, while a larger version would allow China to send crew on lunar and deep space missions. It will also be capable of carrying a new, larger spacecraft than the Shenzhou currently used by the  for crewed missions, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), the country's main space contractor.The rocket currently goes by the cumbersome placeholder name of ""New-Generation Manned Launch Vehicle."" After completing its launch role, the first stage will restart its engines to help it decelerate, using grid fins for guidance, much like the pioneering Falcon 9 rockets flown by SpaceX. Related: However the landing phase will feature ""tethered landing devices"" according to Wang Xiaojun, president of China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), the CASC subsidiary developing the rocket, at a Feb. 17 event  organized by the International Astronautical Federation, the Chinese Society of Astronautics and CALT. Instead of using landing legs, the descending rocket stage will carry hooks and will be caught by tightwires.CASC did not reveal when the rocket will be ready, but  outlined key tasks for the next five years (2021-2025), which included the first launch of the new crew launch vehicle. China currently launches its crewed missions with the expendable Long March 2F rocket, which also uses toxic and therefore dangerous and expensive to manage hypergolic propellant.The new rocket will use refined RP-1 kerosene fuel and liquid oxygen, building on engines developed for China's newer Long March 5, 6, 7 and 8 rockets.

Two launches of the rocket could be used for a short-term crewed lunar landing mission, CALT's veteran Long March rocket designer Long Lehao said in June 2021, according to SpaceNews.China does not yet have a reusable rocket, meaning it has a number of technology breakthroughs to make first. CASC has however stated it aims to convert the Long March 8 first stage to be reusable, while a number of commercial launch companies including Landspace, iSpace, Galactic Energy, Deep Blue Aerospace and more are working on their own concepts vertical takeoff, vertical landing rockets.Follow us on Twitter at @Spacedotcom and on Facebook. to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

"Horizon Forbidden West's Kotallo Has Interesting Connections to Sekiro - GameRant
Kotallo’s character arc and Noshir Dalal’s nuanced performance make . Still, fans might not have noticed that Kotallo actually has more than one connection to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, of all things. It wasn’t intentional, but it’s a pretty big coincidence.RELATED: The most obvious connection between Sekiro and Kotallo is that Noshir Dalal lends his voice to both characters. Dalal is in a ton of games, so it’s not a huge surprise to see him in both Sekiro and Horizon Forbidden West. He also plays Charles Smith in Red Dead Redemption 2, and he had smaller roles in games like Deathloop and Halo Infinite, just to name a few.His resume is impressive, but Sekiro and Kotallo are two of his bigger roles. Further, the two characters are actually very similar. Kotallo has more of a  and much more dialogue, but they’re both men of few words. They’re both stoic, intense, and strong warriors. They also share the same commitment to loyalty, both willing to put their lives on the line to protect the people they serve.As a result, it’s easy to hear little bits of Sekiro hidden within Kotallo’s dialogue. It only makes sense, since they are played by the same person, but that’s not the only thing they have in common.At the beginning of their stories, Kotallo and Sekiro each lose an arm in battle. Their stories start with the exact same event, and that event directs a lot of their stories going forward. Kotallo, as , is devastated when he loses his arm. The Tenakth value strength above all, and come to see him as weak because of his disability. Kotallo’s arc focuses on him healing from the pain and trauma he endured, and learning that he can overcome his injury and be proud of who he is.Kotallo’s story as an amputee is powerful and does a great job of showcasing a strong character with a disability not often seen in video games. Sekiro loses his arm fighting Genichiro at the beginning of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, but he doesn’t seem very emotional about it and immediately gets his prosthetic arm, which he uses for the rest of the game. Still, it’s an interesting coincidence that two of Noshir Dalal’s biggest roles have the same injury – and wind up with the same solution.Fans who haven’t finished Kotallo’s mission, ""What Was Lost,"" should play through it to see the final similarity to Sekiro. Just like his shinobi counterpart, Kotallo decides to craft a prosthetic arm to fight with. Aloy helps him accomplish this, so in the end, both Kotallo and Sekiro use prosthetic arms in combat.Kotallo doesn’t use it all the time; he’s happy to have it but feels it is not his true self. He’s proud of what he overcame and doesn’t want to hide his disability, so he only uses it in battle when he deems it necessary, whereas Sekiro uses it all the time (though to be fair,  is probably always needed).Sekiro and Horizon Forbidden West couldn’t be more different in a lot of ways, but it’s interesting to see the connection between Dalal’s Sekiro and Kotallo roles. It’s a pretty big coincidence that both characters are played by the same actor, suffer the same injury, and develop a prosthetic arm to use in combat. Amputee characters aren’t entirely uncommon in video games, but it’s great to see them represented in such a healthy and positive way, especially through Kotallo's journey.Horizon Forbidden West is available now on PS4 and PS5.

JOHANNESBURG - A proposed overhaul of the African National Congress (ANC)’s subcommittees could see party president Cyril Ramaphosa’s allies taking over strategic portfolios. The proposed changes could also see people outside of the governing party's national executive committee (NEC) being included in the committees to bolster the ANC's capacity. The suggestion could see the likes of Max Boqwana, the CEO of the Thabo Mbeki Foundation, former director of public prosecutions Vusi Pikoli and former minister & Chair of the United Nation’s Committee of Experts of Public Administration Geraldine Fraser Moleketi roped in to assist in the national disciplinary and appeals committees of the party.The leaked deployment, showing suggested changes to NEC subcommittees, dated 28 February, proposes that Justice Minister Ronald Lamola takes over as chair of the legal and constitutional affairs committee, with former communications minister Faith Muthambi as a coordinator. Lamola has been earmarked by some as the right candidate to take over as ANC deputy president when the party holds its 55th elective conference at the end of the year.Former health minister and presidential hopeful Dr Zweli Mkhize’s name’s been removed from the constitutional affairs subcommittee, which he is currently chairing as well as the national disciplinary appeals committee, where he is one of its seven sitting members. Instead Mkhize's name has been added to the education, health & science subcommittee. The highly contested economic transformation subcommittee where contentious topics like radical economic transformation (RET) are dealt with could soon be led by Human Settlements Minister Mamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane. RET has become a rallying point for anti-Ramaohosa campaigners as the contestation towards the December 2022 conference, heats up. The concept was also the main tagline for Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma’s unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2017. Some of RET's include the suspended ANC secretary general Ace Magashule.The economic transformation committee will see current finance minister Enoch Gondogwana vacating that chairman's seat. His successor Kubayi-Ngubane, has been touted as another deputy presidential hopeful and has been praised for taking to any task she’s given. Last year, she played dual roles as both tourism minister and standing in as health minister following the resignation of Mkhize due to his Digital Vibes scandal.Tony Yengeni who has led the peace and stability committee in the past will likely relinquish the position to Zuma ally David Mahlobo. Cosatu President Zingiswa Losi is the proposed coordinator.In communications, Dakota Legoete takes over the role of current national spokesperson Pule Mabe as coordinator, with current chair Nkenke Kekana set to continue in that position. The changes to the national discplinary committee and the national disciplinary committee of appeal will see Susan Shabangu and Nomvula Mokonyane removed their leading respective roles in the two committees, the ANC wants to instead co-opt at least 11 former members into the structures, including Boqwana, Pikoli and Fraser Moleketi as well as the likes of ANC’s head of legal Krish Naidoo, Robinson Ramaite, Johnny De Lange, Thandi Orlyn and Ralph Mgijima among others. The amendments will see former Finance Minister Tito Mboweni, Sdumo Dlamini, Pinky Kekana, former State Security Minister Bongani Bongo, who’s currently on suspension due to the step aside clause as he is facing corruption charges, Nathi Mthethwa and Ngoako Ramatlhodi, added to the committee. This happens with just months to go before the party has to make decisions about its policy direction and elect new leadership. While some may argue to Ramaphosa will return to the helm comfortably, there are those who are plotting otherwise.Some members have already complained about the proposed amendments, saying there are too many faces linked to former president Thabo Mbeki and that Ramaphosa’s allies want to take over every sphere of ANC life, while isolating those who did not support his rise.
