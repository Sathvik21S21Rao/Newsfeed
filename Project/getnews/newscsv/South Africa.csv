"Move over Messi, Argentina has a new hero - SowetanLIVE
Brasilia - Emiliano Martinez needed only a month to establish himself as Argentina's number one goalkeeper and this week he became a new national hero by saving three times in a shootout in their Copa America semi-final against Colombia.With the score tied 1-1 after the regulation 90 minutes, the Aston Villa keeper's exploits in the shootout moved Argentina into a mouthwatering Copa America final against hosts and reigning champions Brazil.Lionel Messi, so often the key man for Argentina, paid tribute to Martinez.“It was difficult at times,” he said. “But we have 'Emi' and he’s phenomenal. We trusted him. We’ve fulfilled our objective of coming here to play every game and now we’re going to the final.”Martinez had little to do over the 90 minutes but was superb in the shootout, diving at full stretch to save from Davinson Sanchez, Yerry Mina and Edwin Cardona.He also earned a rebuke from the referee for his non-stop cheeky chat aimed at Colombia's players as they lined up to take their kicks.The 28-year-old, who had spells with Arsenal, Wolves, Reading, Sheffield Wednesday and Rotherham, only made his international debut on June 3 in a World Cup qualifier against Chile.He was injured in Argentina’s next match against Colombia and taken off when they were leading 2-0. The game ended 2-2 and Martinez was thrown right back into the fray for the next game.Since then he has impressed in what has been a problem position for coach Lionel Scaloni, conceding just three times in six games.Martinez, who may not even have started at the Copa America had River Plate keeper Franco Armani not tested positive for Covid-19, said there was no stopping Argentina now.“We’ve spent 40 days locked away, not seeing anyone outside our bubble,” he said after Tuesday’s victory. “We said on the first day we want to get to the final and what better than to play Brazil at their home."" - ReutersWould you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?

It leaves them a lot of time to get other deals over the line this summer. And there are a number of other positions that the club might be looking to strengthen in over the coming months. One of them appears to be central midfield and Eduardo Camavinga has been heavily linked with a switch to Old Trafford recently.The 18-year-old appears to be the club’s priority in midfield as well. Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano wrote in his column with Sportskeeda:Eduardo Camavinga, on the other hand, is Manchester United’s priority for midfield. The negotiation is ready to start with Rennes. Camavinga’s contract expires in June 2022 and he has no intention of renewing the agreement.Camavinga is one of the most highly-rated young talents in world football today. At 18 years of age, he has already been a regular feature in Rennes’ first-team for a couple of seasons now. Thus, it is not hard to see why there is so much interest in his signature.With just one more year left on his current deal with Rennes, he could possibly be set to depart the French club this summer. And if that was the case, a number of clubs around Europe might be interested in signing him.If Manchester United were able to sign him, would he come in and immediately make an impact in Solskjaer’s first-team? That does seem unlikely. Despite his incredible talent and potential, it is expected that he would take some time to adjust to English football. But when you think about the long-term, he could prove to be a sensational signing.","https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_850,h_560,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Freddevilarmada.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2018%2F08%2F1232968773-850x560.jpeg"
"Pfizer to ask FDA to authorise booster shot of Covid-19 vaccine in next month as Delta variant spreads - Business Insider South Africa
Pfizer Inc plans to ask US regulators to authorise a booster dose of its Covid-19 vaccine within the next month, the drugmaker's top scientist said on Thursday, based on evidence of greater risk of reinfection six months after inoculation and due to the Pfizer and BioNTech said on Thursday they are developing a booster shot that will specifically target the highly transmissible variant. While the companies said they believe a third shot of the two-dose vaccine already in existence could possibly provide the ""highest levels"" of protection against all currently known variants, they are developing an updated version in order to ""remain vigilant,"" CNBC reported. Clinical studies could begin as early as August, depending on regulatory approval, according to the outlet. Pfizer Chief Scientific Officer Mikael Dolsten said the recently reported dip in the  was mostly due to infections in people who had been vaccinated in January or February. The country's health ministry said vaccine effectiveness in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease fell to 64% in June.""The Pfizer vaccine is highly active against the Delta variant,"" Dolsten said in an interview with Reuters. But after six months, he said, ""there likely is the risk of reinfection as antibodies, as predicted, wane.""Pfizer did not release the full set of Israeli data on Thursday, but said it would be published soon.He stressed that data from Israel and Britain suggests that even with waning antibody levels, the vaccine remains around 95% effective against severe disease.The vaccine, developed with German partner BioNTech SE, showed 95% efficacy in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in a clinical trial the companies ran last year.Dolsten said that early data from the company's own studies show that a third booster dose generates antibody levels that are five to 10-fold higher than after the second dose, suggesting that a third dose will offer promising protection.He said that multiple countries in Europe and elsewhere have already approached Pfizer to discuss booster doses, and that some may begin administering them before a potential US authorisation.Dolsten said he believes that booster shots are particularly important in older age groups.Because boosters will drive increasing demand for vaccines as much of the world is still unvaccinated, Dolsten said Pfizer is looking at ways to boost production.Pfizer is already targeting production of three billion doses this year and four billion doses next year. Dolsten declined to give a forecast of exactly how many more doses the company could add, but said: ""We can step up billion after billion in '22.""Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said people will likely need a booster dose of the company's vaccine every 12 months - similar to an annual flu shot. But some scientists question when, or whether, such shots will be needed.",https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/11249/dae5505bc4904c35986d3e0675bb14c1.jpg

Protests will be banned and shopping malls will have to close after 10 p.m.The surge in infections is a worrisome development in a country where a shortage in vaccine supplies have left 70% of the population still waiting for their first shot.The country’s caseload is now at 165,344 after adding more than 8,300 cases in July alone.Critics say the government made things worse by pushing for a premature easing of social distancing over economic concerns.———OTTAWA — Canada’s chief public health officer says there are cases of the latest COVID-19 variant of interest in the country, but it’s too early to know how widespread it is or what impact it could have.Dr. Theresa Tam said Thursday 11 cases of the Lambda variant that was first identified in Peru last year have been reported to Health Canada to date. However, the National Institute of Public Health of Quebec said Thursday it has confirmed 27 cases already, all in March and April.The Public Health Agency of Canada is monitoring Lambda to see how it spreads and how it responds to vaccines, Tam said.“We’re just trying to gather up some information on who it is that’s having the Lambda variant right now, but there’s very few cases at this point,” she said.Early studies, including one from New York University published July 2, suggest Lambda may be a bit resistant to antibodies produced by the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, but concluded it is not by enough “to cause a significant loss of protection against infection.”———DENVER -- Colorado Gov.

Hospitalizations have fluctuated between 500 and 600.——ROME — Confirmed new coronavirus infections in Italy have topped 1,000 for the second straight day as health authorities voice growing concern over what they say appears to be a trend toward rising case numbers.Health Ministry figures show 1,394 cases were registered in the last 24 hours compared with daily caseloads in the hundreds in previous weeks.Virus experts credit vaccination with keeping the number of new ICU admissions low despite the higher caseloads, however.Italy is stressing the importance of vaccines as the virus' delta variant steadily gains traction.So far 41% of people in Italy older than 12 and thus eligible to receive the shots are fully vaccinated, while an additional 20% or so have received an initial vaccine dose.———NEW YORK — New research from France adds to evidence that COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against the delta variant that is spreading rapidly around the world and now accounts for most U.S. infections.The delta variant is surging through populations with low vaccination rates. Researchers from France’s Pasteur Institute reported new evidence Thursday in the journal Nature that full vaccination is critical.In tests, a single dose of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines “barely inhibited” the delta variant. But after a second dose, almost all experienced a big boost in immunity.Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says highly immunized swaths of America are getting back to normal while hospitalizations are rising in other places.A few weeks ago, the delta variant accounted for just over a quarter of new U.S. cases. But it now accounts for just over 50%, and in some places, such as parts of the Midwest, as much as 80%.———LISBON, Portugal — Portuguese authorities are requiring a negative test or proof of vaccination for people wanting to enter restaurants and hotels at peak periods in areas where the coronavirus is surging.The government announced Thursday it wants people to use the EU Digital COVID Certificate to patronize such businesses on Friday evenings, weekends and public holidays.The high-risk areas are mostly around the capital Lisbon and in the southern Algarve vacation region.The certificates, which can be downloaded to an app, certify EU citizens’ tests and vaccinations. They also allow them to travel between countries without having to quarantine or be tested.Portugal’s coronavirus 14-day incidence rate has risen to 255 per 100,000 people in recent weeks, pushed higher by the more infectious delta variant.———LOS ANGELES — California workplace safety officials plan to fine the Los Angeles County Superior Court system more than $25,000 for alleged violations involving the COVID-19 pandemic.The system shut down all but the most essential services in early 2020 but resumed many in-person proceedings in the final months of the year.About 16 interpreters were exposed to COVID-19, and one died in January 2021.

About 11% of the population have received at least one dose.———LONDON — Britain’s transportation secretary says fully vaccinated U.K. residents returning from travel to most countries will no longer have to quarantine starting in July 19.Travelers still must take a coronavirus test three days before returning to the U.K., and within two days after their arrival.

Alabama Gov. Kay IveyGov. Kay Ivey took to Facebook on Thursday to clarify that  following  that the state could be forced to consider new restrictions if Alabama sees a surge of COVID-19 cases this summer.“Alabama is OPEN for business, Vaccines are readily available, and I encourage folks to get one. The state of emergency and health orders have expired. We are moving forward,” Ivey wrote on Facebook.Ivey’s comments came in response to an article quoting UAB’s Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, who said Wednesday that she is very concerned about a recent increase in hospitalizations due to the highly infectious Delta variant. She said that if Alabama sees a COVID-19 surge, the state may need to reconsider restrictions.“When you get to that point and healthcare delivery is threatened and you start to see the death rates increase, you’ve probably gotten past the point where some restrictions should really be considered,” she said at a press conference Wednesday.The Delta variant is four times as contagious as the original COVID-19 strain and can be transmitted within 5-10 seconds of contact.Alabama’s Department of Public Health has identified 51 cases of the Delta variant strain. The state has limited capacity to conduct sequencing of the virus.It has quickly swept through the United States and is now the dominant strain of COVID-19 nationwide.UAB hospital saw a five-fold increase of hospitalizations between June 24 and July 5, up to 24 patients hospitalized by July 4, an increase from 5 hospitalizations on June 2. The increase is among mostly younger patients, following a national trend, said Dr. Marrazzo. Of those hospitalized with COVID-19 in Alabama,  a study by the Alabama Hospital Association showed.With 33 percent of the state’s population fully vaccinated, Alabama has the nation’s second to lowest vaccination rate following Mississippi, according to the CDC.Vaccines are largely effective against the Delta variant, according to available studies.Dr. Marrazzo on Wednesday said the relatively low rates of vaccination in Alabama make it vulnerable to a surge of COVID-19 cases this summer and a rise in deaths. She also noted the possibility that a spike in cases could cause the rise of a variant with an ability to evade vaccines.Dr. Marrazzo acknowledged that restrictions are not popular in Alabama, but that a possible surge could threaten efforts to get back to normal.“There’s a point where you really just can’t ignore what’s going on. Where that balance is… is something we’re going to have to grapple with,” Dr. Marrazzo said Wednesday.Get up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/e2/1e26ac13-c708-583b-9872-434d6cea7d0c/60e7568ca6d51.image.jpg,"SA homeless to get COVID-19 vaccine - The Islander

""We are tired.""Later that day, Tyler posted a follow-up TikTok.

Mutodi was planning on moving  back home  on July 1.”Fourteen days before he passed, Mutodi fell ill ... On July 1, the day he was supposed to move back in, Mutodi lost his life.“I thank God that Mutodi passed knowing that I loved him,” she added.Neshehe is survived by two daughters, Alexis and Sadeen Neshehe, who also expressed how much they loved their father.“I will forever miss my dad. I will miss the sushi dates. I will miss our hugs. I will miss the way he looked at me. I know he was preparing for this. I love you dad, so much and I will be a good big sister.  And I will look out for my mom. She won't be able to date anyone ... Thank you for everything.” Alexis said.Sadeen said, “When I first heard the news of my father passing, I was heartbroken, I wanted my dad to live with me and all of us until all of us died together — that's all I want, I just want my father back. I truly miss him ... I truly love my father and just want him back.” The late actor's nephew, Kgotso Junior Neshehe, recalled his last moments with the actor saying that before they made the decision to take him to  hospital, he had experienced a scratchy throat and body aches until they put him on oxygen to help him with his  breathing. “I stepped out to call Lesley and on my way back, he had fallen off his chair and that was the last time ... I don't know, I'm going to miss you,” he said of his last moment with Mutodi. “I don't know how I'm going to fill your size 11s but I will try to make you proud,” he said.Watch the  funeral service below:",https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/photo/81478822.cms
"Expect a surge in coastal flooding, says NASA - IT-Online
High-tide floods – also called nuisance floods or sunny day floods – are already a familiar problem in many coastal cities.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported a total of more than 600 floods in US coastal towns in 2019. Starting in the mid-2030s, however, the alignment of rising sea levels with a lunar cycle will cause coastal cities all around the US to begin a decade of dramatic increases in flood numbers, according to the first study that takes into account all known oceanic and astronomical causes for floods.Led by the members of the NASA Sea Level Change Science Team from the University of Hawaii, the new study shows that high tides will exceed known flooding thresholds around the country more often. What’s more, the floods will sometimes occur in clusters lasting a month or longer, depending on the positions of the Moon, Earth, and the Sun. When the Moon and Earth line up in specific ways with each other and the Sun, the resulting gravitational pull and the ocean’s corresponding response may leave city dwellers coping with floods every day or two.“Low-lying areas near sea level are increasingly at risk and suffering due to the increased flooding, and it will only get worse,” says NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “The combination of the Moon’s gravitational pull, rising sea levels, and climate change will continue to exacerbate coastal flooding on our coastlines and across the world. NASA’s Sea Level Change Team is providing crucial information so that we can plan, protect, and prevent damage to the environment and people’s livelihoods affected by flooding.”“It’s the accumulated effect over time that will have an impact,” says Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii and the lead author of the new study, published this month in Nature Climate Change.Thompson points out that, because high-tide floods involve a small amount of water compared to hurricane storm surges, there’s a tendency to view them as a less significant problem overall. “But if it floods 10 or 15 times a month, a business can’t keep operating with its parking lot under water. People lose their jobs because they can’t get to work. Seeping cesspools become a public health issue.”Why will cities on such widely separated coastlines begin to experience these higher rates of flooding at almost the same time? The main reason is a regular wobble in the Moon’s orbit that takes 18.6 years to complete. There’s nothing new or dangerous about the wobble; it was first reported in 1728. What’s new is how one of the wobble’s effects on the Moon’s gravitational pull – the main cause of Earth’s tides – will combine with rising sea levels resulting from the planet’s warming.In half of the Moon’s 18,6-year cycle, Earth’s regular daily tides are suppressed: High tides are lower than normal, and low tides are higher than normal. In the other half of the cycle, tides are amplified: High tides get higher, and low tides get lower. Global sea level rise pushes high tides in only one direction – higher. So half of the 18,6-year lunar cycle counteracts the effect of sea level rise on high tides, and the other half increases the effect.The Moon is in the tide-amplifying part of its cycle now. However, along most US coastlines, sea levels have not risen so much that even with this lunar assist, high tides regularly top flooding thresholds.It will be a different story the next time the cycle comes around to amplify tides again, in the mid-2030s. Global sea level rise will have been at work for another decade. The higher seas, amplified by the lunar cycle, will cause a leap in flood numbers on almost all US mainland coastlines, Hawaii, and Guam. Only far northern coastlines, including Alaska’s, will be spared for another decade or longer because these land areas are rising due to long-term geological processes.The researchers uncovered these tipping points in flood numbers by studying 89 tide gauge locations in every coastal US state and territory but Alaska. They created a new statistical framework that mapped NOAA’s widely used sea level rise scenarios and flooding thresholds, the number of times those thresholds have been exceeded annually, astronomical cycles, and statistical representations of other processes, such as El Niño events, that are known to affect tides. They projected results to 2080.Ben Hamlington of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a co-author of the paper and also the leader of NASA’s Sea Level Change Team. He notes that the findings of the new study are a vital resource for coastal urban planners, who may be focused on preparing for extreme events rather than more high-tide floods.“From a planning perspective, it’s important to know when we’ll see an increase,” Hamlington says. “Understanding that all your events are clustered in a particular month, or you might have more severe flooding in the second half of a year than the first – that’s useful information.”Featured pic: High-tide flooding in Honolulu.

By Chrissy SextonEarth.com staff writerMassive asteroid impacts in Earth’s distant past are nothing new. Anyone that knows anything about dinosaurs knows that these space rocks were involved in their demise. Scientists have long been aware that enormous asteroids – larger than 10 kilometers in diameter – have pummelled the Earth. In a recent study, experts investigated how often large asteroids hit our planet in the past, and they found something shocking.  “We have developed a new impact flux model and compared with a statistical analysis of ancient spherule layer data. With this approach, we found that current models of Earth’s early bombardment severely underestimate the number of known impacts, as recorded by spherule layers,” explained Dr. Simone Marchi of the Southwest Research Institute.“The true impact flux could have been up to a factor of 10 times higher than previously thought in the period between 3.5 and 2.5 billion years ago. This means that in that early period, we were probably being hit by a Chicxulub-sized impact on average every 15 million years. Quite a spectacle!”Extraterrestrial bodies like the Moon show obvious scars from asteroid impacts. On Earth, the signs of ancient collisions are masked by the atmosphere, weathering and other features. There is one sure sign of a past impact from an asteroid – little rocks called spherules. These are formed when the molten rock from a collision is thrown into the air and then rain back to earth where they become embedded in other stones. The more of these spherules found, the larger an impact.     Scientists are interested in asteroid impacts on Earth because they could possibly explain the development of our atmosphere. Furthermore, it is possible that an asteroid was important for the beginning of life on Earth. So far, the scientists claim, the consideration of asteroids in our understanding of life on Earth has mostly been ignored. Perhaps this research will open a new chapter in our understanding of the history of our planet. “As we deepen our understanding of the early Earth, we find that cosmic collisions are like the proverbial elephant in the room. They are often neglected as we lack a detailed knowledge of their number and magnitude, but it is likely these energetic events fundamentally altered the Earth’s surface and atmospheric evolution,” said Dr. Marchi.The research will be presented at the .–—By Zach Fitzner , Earth.com Staff WriterFind more related articlesYour Email",https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2021/07/09004324/shutterstock_2044486782-730x410.jpg,"South Africa's MeerKAT discovers treasure trove of galaxies - TechCentral
The South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (Sarao) has announced that a group of 20 galaxies have been discovered with the MeerKAT telescope.This large galaxy group is likely the most neutral hydrogen gas-rich group ever discovered, and it is the first time this group has been identified, despite residing in a very well-studied area of the sky.Sarao said most star-forming galaxies are embedded within a cloud of cold neutral hydrogen gas, which acts as the raw fuel from which stars can eventually form. This gas is extremely faint and can only be detected in radio wavelengths. It is diffuse and extends beyond the visible part of the galaxy.By observing this hydrogen gas, astronomers are able to understand the evolutionary processes that take place in galaxies.The majority of galaxies in the universe reside in groups. However, it is rare to detect a group with such a large number of group members with so much neutral hydrogen. This suggests that the group is still in the process of assembly, as it has not undergone evolutionary processes that would remove this gas from the galaxies.The paper on the discovery was led by Shilpa Ranchod, an MSc student supervised by Prof Roger Deane at the University of Pretoria.“The distribution of neutral hydrogen gas in these galaxies has revealed interesting, disturbed morphologies suggesting that these galaxies are group members, and are being influenced by their cosmic neighbours in the group.“For example, we found an interacting pair of galaxies that will potentially merge to form a new galaxy with a completely transformed appearance,” Ranchod said.This galaxy group was discovered by the MeerKAT International Gigahertz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (Mightee) survey. It is one of the large survey projects in progress with South Africa’s MeerKAT telescope and involves a team of South African and international astronomers.The MeerKAT radio telescope in the Northern Cape, South Africa’s precursor to the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), aims to answer fundamental questions about the formation and evolution of galaxies. Its exceptional sensitivity provides astronomers with further insight into the drivers of galaxy evolution.“This galaxy group sits in an area of sky that has been studied with many other telescopes, but only with MeerKAT is the group structure revealed so clearly.“Galaxy environment strongly affects how galaxies change and grow, and observations of neutral hydrogen with MeerKAT give us a new observational window into structures like this,” said Natasha Maddox, research scientist at Ludwig Maximilians Universität in Munich, and co-chair of the Mightee neutral hydrogen working group.“MeerKAT is an important step in the direction of the SKA — providing us with a view to future SKA science projects and lessons on how to overcome the many technical challenges involved in realising the true scientific potential of SKA and SKA pathfinders,” said Bradley Frank, Sarao’s associate director of astronomy operations at the Inter-university Institute for Data Intensive Astronomy and co-chair of the Mightee neutral hydrogen working group.“This discovery shows that our MeerKAT observations caught a galaxy group in the early stages of its assembly, which is very uncommon. Therefore, this discovery is not only important per se, but will set new grounds for understanding of how galaxies are assembled into groups and transformed by their environment. We expect many wonderful findings like this in the future, thanks to the ongoing MeerKAT surveys,” said Anastasia Ponomareva, researcher at the University of Oxford and co-author of the paper.",https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/meerkat-2156-1120.jpg,"Longest known continuous record of the Paleozoic discovered in Yukon wilderness - Phys.org
Hundreds of millions of years ago, in the middle of what would eventually become Canada's Yukon Territory, an ocean swirled with armored trilobites, clam-like brachiopods and soft, squishy creatures akin to slugs and squid.

                                         
                                                  





A trove of fossils and rock layers formed on that ancient ocean floor have now been unearthed by an international team of scientists along the banks of the Peel River a few hundred miles south of the Arctic's Beaufort Sea. The discovery reveals oxygen changes at the seafloor across nearly 120 million years of the early Paleozoic era, a time that fostered the most rapid development and diversification of complex, multi-cellular life in Earth's history.
""It's unheard of to have that much of Earth's history in one place,"" said Stanford University geological scientist Erik Sperling, lead author of a July 7 study detailing the team's findings in Science Advances. Most rock formations from the Paleozoic Era have been broken up by tectonic forces or eroded over time. ""There's nowhere else in the world that I know of where you can study that long a record of Earth history, where there's basically no change in things like water depth or basin type.""
Oxygen was scarce in the deep water of this and other oceans at the dawn of the Paleozoic, roughly 541 million years ago. It stayed scarce until the Devonian, roughly 405 million years ago, when, in a geological blink—no more than a few million years—oxygen likely rocketed to levels close to those in modern oceans and the diversity of life on Earth exploded. Big, predatory fish appeared. Primitive ferns and conifers marched across continents previously ruled by bacteria and algae. Dragonflies took flight. And all of this after nearly four billion years of Earth's landscapes being virtually barren.
Scientists have long debated what might have caused the dramatic shift from a low oxygen world to a more oxygenated one that could support a diverse web of animal life. But until now, it has been difficult to pin down the timing of global oxygenation or the long-term, background state of the world's oceans and atmosphere during the era that witnessed both the so-called Cambrian explosion of life and the first of Earth's ""Big Five"" mass extinctions, about 445 million years ago at the end of the Ordovician.






""In order to make comparisons throughout these huge swaths of our history and understand long-term trends, you need a continuous record,"" said Sperling, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth).
Context for past life
With permission from the Na Cho Nyak Dun and Tetlit Gwitch'in communities in Yukon, Sperling's team, which included researchers from Dartmouth College and the Yukon Geological Survey, spent three summers at the Peel River site. Arriving by helicopter, the research team hacked through brush with machetes beside Class VI rapids to collect hundreds of fist-sized samples of rock from more than a mile of interbedded layers of shale, chert and lime mudstone.
Back at Sperling's lab at Stanford, a small army of summer undergraduates and graduate students worked over five summers to help analyze the fossils and chemicals entombed in the rocks. ""We spent a lot of time splitting open rocks and looking at graptolite fossils,"" Sperling said. Because graptolites evolved a vast array of recognizable body shapes relatively quickly, the pencil-like markings left by the fossils of these colony-dwelling sea creatures give geologists a way to date the rocks in which they're found.
Once the researchers had finished identifying and dating graptolite fossils, they ground the rocks in a mill, then measured iron, carbon, phosphorous and other elements in the resulting powder to assess the ocean conditions at the time and place where the layers formed. They analyzed 837 new samples from the Peel River site, as well as 106 new samples from other parts of Canada and 178 samples from around the world for comparison.
Winners and losers
The data show low oxygen levels, or anoxia, likely persisted in the world's oceans for millions of years longer than previously thought—well into the Phanerozoic, when land plants and early animals began to diversify. ""The early animals were still living in a low oxygen world,"" Sperling said. Contrary to long-held assumptions, the scientists found Paleozoic oceans were also surprisingly free of hydrogen sulfide, a respiratory toxin often found in the anoxic regions of modern oceans.
When oxygen eventually did tick upward in marine environments, it came about just as larger, more complex plant life took off. ""There's a ton of debate about how plants impacted the Earth system,"" Sperling said. ""Our results are consistent with a hypothesis that as plants evolved and covered the Earth, they increased nutrients to the ocean, driving oxygenation."" In this hypothesis, the influx of nutrients to the sea would have given a boost to primary productivity, a measure of how quickly plants and algae take carbon dioxide and sunlight, turn them into new biomass—and release oxygen in the process.
The change probably killed off graptolites. ""Although more oxygen is really good for a lot of organisms, graptolites lost the low oxygen habitat that was their refuge,"" Sperling said. ""Any environmental change is going to have winners and losers. Graptolites might have been the losers.""

The all-new BMW 2 Series Coupé has been unveiled to the world. A modern successor to the much-lauded 2002 of the late 1960s, this compact rear wheel-drive coupé ushers in a welcome return to tradition with proper old-school driving thrills and aggressive good looks. Scheduled to hit the market in 2022, here are five things you need to know about it.1: It's larger than its predecessorRiding atop BMW's rear-driven CLAR platform, the new second-generation BMW 2 Series Coupé is significantly bigger than the model it replaces. Whip out your tape measure and you will discover that it's 105mm longer and 64mm wider. The wheelbase has been extended by 51mm while the front track has been widened by 54mm and the rear by 31mm. Meanwhile, the roofline has been lowered by 28mm for a slightly lower centre of gravity. Lateral torsional rigidity is up by 12% and 50:50 weight distribution is ensured thanks to the fitment of a lightweight aluminium bonnet and aluminium front wings. In terms of exterior styling, the new 2 Series Coupé adopts an evolutionary approach that builds on the dapper aesthetics of its predecessor. Now while we're not crazy about the mishmash of shapes present in the lower half of the front bumper, we do like the newly designed kidney grille. The latter features active air flaps to increase aerodynamic efficiency and reduce drag at higher speeds. Special mention must also go to the new LED headlamps that feature individual circular elements – a hat-tip to the 02 models of old. 2: Three model derivatives When the new 2 Series Coupé arrives in SA customers will be able to pick from one of three models. Kicking things off is the 220i Coupé that sports a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged petrol engine good for 135kW and 300Nm. Expect 0-100km/h in 7.5 seconds and a VO2 max of 236km/h. Next up is the 220d Coupé that comes bolted to a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbodiesel developing 140kW and 400Nm. BMW claims that it will sprint to 100km/h in 7 seconds and reach a maximum speed of 237km/h. Aided by 48v mild hybrid technology, it can achieve miserly fuel consumption: 4.8l/100km on the combined cycle. Those seeking more excitement can opt for the flagship M240i xDrive Coupé that packs a 3.0-litre six-cylinder turbocharged engine (the trusty B58) twisting out 285kW and 500Nm. Distributed to all four wheels via a rear-biased all wheel-drive system, these figures translate to a 0-100km/h time of 4.3 seconds and a limited top speed of 250km/h. All three models are paired exclusively to an eight-speed Steptronic Sport transmission.3: A focused chassisThe M240i xDrive Coupé ups the ante with a model-specific version of the M Sport suspension, additional front axle struts, M Sport brakes and a mechanical rear M Sport limited-slip differential. The engineers also dialled in some extra negative camber and further widened the track: +9mm up front and +4mm at the rear. Here customers can also tick the box on Adaptive M suspension with electronically controlled dampers as well as a set of high performance tyres to shoe this flagship model's 19-inch M light-alloy wheels.4: Improved interior with more techThe cabin of the new 2 Series Coupé is pretty much identical to the one used in the current 3 Series. Compared to the outgoing model this means a welcomed hike in overall quality, fit and finish. Sport seats and a sport multifunction steering wheel are both fitted as standard fare, as is three-zone automatic climate control and ambient lighting. You can also look forward to the BMW Live Cockpit Professional system that consists of a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system and a 12.3-inch digital TFT instrument cluster.

It will compete in the new Le Mans Hypercar (LMH) class which, along with the Le Mans Daytona Hybrid (LMDh), succeed LMP1 as the top class in endurance racing.The greater flexibility allowed by the sport’s new aerodynamic rules has seen the 9X8 designed with a unique feature: unlike most racing cars, it doesn’t  have a rear wing.The regulations permit just  one adjustable aerodynamic device,  without specifying the rear wing, and Peugeot’s simulations revealed that high performance was  possible without one.“The absence of a rear wing on the Peugeot 9X8 is a major innovative step,” says Stellantis Motorsport director Jean-Marc Finot. “We have achieved a degree of aerodynamic efficiency that allows us to do away with this feature. Don’t ask how, though. We have every intention of keeping that a secret as long as we possibly can.”Doing away with a rear wing provided the freedom to design a  sleek silhouette that hasn’t been seen for decades, according to Peugeot. The result is a harmonious blend of dynamic, sculpted shapes which form a clean, sweeping surface between the prominent wheel arches.The 9X8’s front and rear lighting,  which take the form of three claw-like strokes, are familiar styling trademarks in Peugeot’s road cars, while the brand’s new lion’s head logo features in backlit form at the front and on the sides of the car.The 98X uses a hybrid power unit and all-wheel drive, with a seven-speed sequential gearbox. At the rear is a 2.6l bi-turbo V6 engine producing 500kW, complemented by a front-mounted 200kW motor-generator unit fed by a 900-volt high-density battery.“Le Mans has become a 24-hour sprint race that can be won or lost by the number of times you pit. The exceptional energy efficiency of the new hypercars prefigures what we will see shortly in the world of road cars,” Finot says.“This consideration had a fundamental influence on our work on the Peugeot 9X8 package, every aspect of which needs to contribute to achieving hyper-efficiency, from its power train to its aerodynamics,” he says.Would you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?

The AirTag works with the Find My app, which also tracks AirPods, MacBooks, Apple Watches and iPhones. It can also be accessed using iCloud, which is useful when you want to track a stolen device.Once you open the AirTag, it activates seamlessly and pairs with the Find My app. Each AirTag is assigned a custom description or emoji. I’ve attached it to my keys as I misplace them constantly. To locate them, I can either ping them or use directions to find them.The AirTag pairs on any device running iOS/iPadOS 14.5 or later. It has accessibility features for the visually impaired; it works with VoiceOver to read out instructions.You can attach an AirTag to keys, wallets, luggage, running shoes, pet collars or handbags. But in typical Apple fashion, these trackers do not have a built-in key chain hole, so you’d have to fork out extra for an accessory.There are delays with shipments of Apple’s leather keyring attachments. They have not yet reached SA and pre-orders are on a backlog, which means customers have to pay a little more for third-party accessories.The AirTag can only be paired to an iPhone, but Android handsets can scan a lost tag to access the owner’s contact details. (Similarly, Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag only works with Galaxy devices.)In June Apple updated the AirTag to address stalking issues. It will ping for between eight and 24 hours if separated from its owner, instead of the initial three-day window at launch.Apple is playing to its strengths with the AirTag. It’s a slick product that appeals to anyone tied to its ecosystem. It costs R499 for one tag or R1,899 for a pack of four.Would you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?

"PMB High Court dismisses Jacob Zuma's bid to stay arrest - Eyewitness News
JOHANNESBURG - Judge Bhekisisa Mnguni on Friday dismissed former President Jacob Zuma's application to stay his arrest.Mnguni delivered the judgment in the Pietermaritzburg High Court as Zuma spends his third day at the Estcourt Correctional Centre in KwaZulu-Natal.Earlier this week Zuma’s lawyer Dali Mpofu referred to the state capture commission and the Helen Suzman Foundation as “busy-bodies” who had no business to oppose the former president’s bid to stay out of jail - pending the outcome of his rescission application in the Constitutional Court.Mpofu called on the court to suspend a directive by the apex court that gave Police Minister Bheki Cele and National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole until Wednesday to arrest Zuma and take him to  correctional facility so that he could commence his prison sentence.But lawyers representing the state capture commission and the Helen Suzman Foundation accused Zuma of attempting to use the Pietermaritzburg High Court to help him break the law.After a number of dramatic days leading up to his imprisonment, Zuma's speeding convoy left his Nkandla homestead before the Wednesday midnight deadline set by the Constitutional Court. He is the first president of democratic South Africa to be arrested, and the first president of South Africa ever to be jailed.'SENDING ME TO JAIL IS LIKE A DEATH SENTENCE'On Sunday night, Zuma gave a public address live from his Nkandla home, saying the move by the Constitutional Court essentially sentenced him without a trial, and sending him to jail was tantamount to a death sentence.""The death sentence was declared unconstitutional in South Africa in 1995. As a result of my sacrificed and those of millions of South Africans,"" he said. ""Sending me to jail during the height of a pandemic at my age is the same as sentencing me to death.""Earlier on Sunday, Zuma addressed his supporters who gathered outside his house, telling them that he was not aware of any transgressions by him, despite the ruling.He also accused Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, who heads the state capture inquiry, of being biased against him.""I made a submission to Judge Zondo, pointing out exact details to support my contention that he is not neutral. He also made his own submission to disprove my contention and subsequently ruled that his own submission is victorious. This then meant that I was now forced to appear before somebody I have accused of bias and conflict of interest,"" Zuma said.He stated that ""had Judge Zondo simply recused himself and allowed my submission to be made to somebody neutral, the people of South Africa would have heard my version as regards all the unsubstantiated allegations against me"".During his address, he also likened the COVID-19 lockdown to what happened during apartheid.""We have a level four lockdown, with all hallmarks of a state of emergency, and the curfews of the 1980s. The only difference is that we only use different levels, like contempt of court instead of detention without trial. But the substance is exactly the same. Being jailed without a trial is no different to the apartheid detention without trial.""Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.

Suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule's application to challenge his suspension by the party was dismissed with costs on Friday.This follows a full-bench unanimous decision by the Johannesburg high court.Delivering the judgment, judge Jody Kollapen said: “The application incorporating the relief sought is dismissed with costs including the costs of three counsel. The judgment is handed down.”Kollapen, in his summary of what drove the court to dismissing Magashule’s application, stated among other things that Magashule's contention that his suspension failed to observe principles of natural justice was false.Furthermore, the court was firm that the ANC constitution’s rule 25.70, from which Magashule’s suspension was derived, was consistent with the constitution of the country.On Magashule’s claim  that he was not afforded a hearing before his suspension, the court held that this was not supported by facts, as Magashule had to state his case before the ANC Integrity Commission as well as  national officials of the party.Magashule’s “purported suspension” of ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa, noted the court, was not in line with the rule 25.70 because Ramaphosa was not charged with any crime.Magashule is at loggerheads with his party after Ramaphosa suspended him for defying the ANC's step-aside resolution. Under the step-aside regime, when an ANC member is charged with a serious criminal offence, they should step aside from their position. If they do not, they may be suspended.This is a developing storyTimesLIVE",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Joburg mayor Geoff Makhubo loses battle with Covid-19 - IOL
