"Kurt Lentjies replaces Gavin Hunt as Chippa United coach - SowetanLIVE
Chippa United named  Kurt Lentjies as the team’s caretaker coach and Siya Gwambi as his assistant, the club said in a statement on Monday.Lentjies and Gwambi took charge of the morning training session at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.Hunt, Ian Taylor and Roy Limongelli have all been suspended with immediate effect due to poor results.“Following the club having endured its worst start to the league of 10 matches and only one victory, the club has placed head coach Gavin Hunt on precautionary suspension, while [it] investigates the matter according to its internal processes,” the statement said.“In the absence of the head coach, Kurt Lentjies will take up a caretaker position and shall be assisted by Siyabulela Gwambi.“Lentjies has been a stalwart for the club, and following his retirement from playing ensured he attained his coaching qualifications.“His intricate knowledge of the team, players, and culture of the club should ensure the club will be in good stead during this period.“We trust that these measures will be the beginning of a turnaround to the season, and bring hope again to the stakeholders and fans of the Pride of the Eastern Cape.”A source close to the camp said the club was divided, as some people within management were fighting for Hunt to stay and continue with his duties, while other parties wanted him out.The former Kaizer Chiefs and Bidvest Wits coach’s suspension hardly comes as a surprise, as the club have been struggling to get positive results in the DStv Premiership this season.Under Hunt’s guidance, the Chilli Boys have only recorded one win — against Sekhukhune United in their opening match — and have since gone nine matches without a victory.Their poor string of results has them positioned 14th on the log.TimesLIVEWould you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?

Mango is to be mothballed while it  tries to get a strategic equity partner in place, dashing any hopes of the low-cost carrier being back in the sky by December for the lucrative festive season as originally envisaged in its proposed business rescue plan.It also means that more of the 708 jobs at Mango will be lost than originally thought.The original business rescue plan, published on October 29, intended to save most of the jobs at the airline — but Mango has confirmed that a greater number of employees will now be affected.Mango’s creditors were meant to vote on Monday on whether to give the low-cost carrier’s business rescue plan the green light  but the meeting was adjourned by a maximum 15 business days after the  carrier’s shareholder SAA requested it so the plan could be amended to include the proviso that the airline first find a strategic equity partner before launching operations.Late on Monday afternoon, Mango said  that it “is immediately clear that the airline will be mothballed for a considerable period, as the process of securing an investor will take some time”.“Accordingly, the amended plan will inevitably have to contemplate a greater number of employees being potentially affected by the restructuring than is the case in the current plan that was published on 29 October 2021. As is now a matter of public record, the business rescue practitioner of the company, Sipho Sono, had already initiated a process to invite employees to apply for voluntary severance packages  as part of mitigating the need for retrenchments in terms of section 189 of the Labour Relations Act.“This aspect of the plan will continue and the BRP [business rescue practitioner] was assured by SAA and the department of public enterprises that funds will be released during the course of this week, or at worst early next week, to implement the voluntary severance packages,” the statement read. It said applications for packages will close on Friday.This latest development is seen as a blow by the Mango Pilots' Association chair Jordan Butler, who said it meant “sacrificing the entire workforce at Mango” and was a poor outcome.“The business rescue practitioner had also confirmed he would be able to fetch a much higher price if the airline was sold as a going concern, but SAA and the Treasury have refused to fund  it so Mango can’t implement the plan,” said Butler.He said  that while the condition that there be a “significant onboarding of  a strategic equity partner” had to be included in the amendments to the plan it “does not mean that a deal has to be fully concluded for Mango to resume operations” — only “substantially concluded”.Butler said  SAA and  the public enterprises department had agreed to “pay across R320m to pay out staff voluntary severance packages and possible retrenchments”, it remained to be seen whether “SAA and Treasury live up to their commitments”.He said an amended plan would be published in  10 business days with a vote by creditors to follow five working days later.Mango said SAA had proposed a motion for the meeting to be adjourned to incorporate certain proposals that “will enable both SAA and the ultimate shareholder, namely the department of public enterprises, to support the plan”.“The substance of SAA’s proposed amendment is that the plan be amended to effectively cater for resumption of operations only once the process of securing an investor has been concluded, with a preferred bidder having been identified,” said the statement.Mango said that after deliberation, it was agreed that meeting should be adjourned to “consider and effect the proposed amendments and thereafter reconvene the meeting of creditors in order for the affected people to consider and vote on the amended plan”.SAA said in a statement, also issued late on Monday, that it had “presented its view to the creditors of Mango”, adding there “are no reasonable prospects of Mango succeeding should it be operationalised before obtaining an investor or equity partner”.“SAA’s position is that this process should be finalised as soon as possible. SAA says operations should only resume thereafter, thus mitigating the risk of Mango not being able to financially sustain itself going forward. SAA does not believe the current plan presented by the business rescue practitioners that Mango resume operations in December is feasible and asked all stakeholders for the meeting to be adjourned for the current plan to be reviewed and for an amended version to be presented.”SAA described the global aviation market as “highly volatile” and unpredictable, particularly in light of new Covid-19 waves.  It said there were “no reasonable prospects of Mango succeeding should it be operationalised before obtaining an investor or equity partner”.“SAA is looking forward to co-operating with the BRPs as they are finalising their plan,” it said.At the weekend, Butler had said that SAA’s insistence on the plan being changed to include the proviso of a strategic equity partner being in place could delay Mango’s relaunch for some time as “one must consider the Public Finance Management Act’s procedures, which take time”.Business Times",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"Terawatt-hour of energy storage by 2030: BloombergNEF forecasts boom in installations - Energy Storage News
The 2020s are “the energy storage decade,” and the world will surpass a terawatt-hour of installations by the time they are over, according to predictions made by analysts at BloombergNEF. From 17GW / 34GWh online as of the end of 2020, there will be investment worth US$262 billion in making 345GW / 999GWh of new energy storage deployments, with cumulative installations reaching 358GW / 1,028GWh by 2030, the firm forecasts in the latest edition of its Global Energy Storage Outlook report. “This is the energy storage decade. We’ve been anticipating significant scale-up for many years and the industry is now more than ready to deliver,” BloombergNEF head of decentralised energy Yayoi Sekine said. Just over half of that new capacity will be built to provide energy shifting, storing surplus solar and wind generation for dispatch to the grid and to be used when it’s most needed at a later time. This is already being seen in the growing popularity of renewable energy-plus-storage projects, particularly solar-plus-storage. While large-scale, front-of-the-meter energy storage is likely to dominate those capacity additions, about a quarter will be deployed at residential and commercial & industrial (C&I) scale, with consumers seeking both higher shares of renewable energy integration and the back up power capability that energy storage can provide. BloombergNEF believes that as things stand, energy storage as a means to defer investment in more expensive grid infrastructure may remain marginal as an application in most markets through to 2030. However, the removal of regulatory barriers and the introduction of incentives for networks owners to consider energy storage as an alternative to traditional infrastructure investment could change that dynamic. It’s the rapid evolution of battery tech which drives the energy storage market, according to BloombergNEF. Multiple lithium-ion battery chemistries are being adopted by the industry, with lithium iron phosphate (LFP) set to overtake nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) for stationary storage applications for the first time in 2021. LFP will continue that upward trajectory and be the main chemistry of choice for the decade, but BloombergNEF said it’s worth keeping an eye on new developments like sodium-ion — which Chinese manufacturer CATL is currently working to commercialise. Sodium-ion could play a “meaningful role” as a contender to lithium, the firm said. Batteries will dominate over non-electrochemical storage technologies that could theoretically offer practical solutions to the question of storing energy for longer durations, BloombergNEF said, at least until the 2030s. Competitive advantages such as price, established supply chain and track record will be among the factors keeping that the case. No mention was made of the many non-lithium battery technologies besides sodium-ion, in a press release sent to Energy-Storage.news. Another market research group, Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, made a similar installation forecast in October when it published its own Global Energy Storage Outlook report, saying that a . Both Wood Mackenzie and BloombergNEF also predicted the US and China will dominate the global market, installing more than half of all new storage by 2030. In the US, utilities and state governments are showing a growing appetite to drive energy storage deployment forwards, while in China, a 30GW by 2025 deployment target is a major driver, as are stricter rules on renewable energy integration on the grid. “The global storage market is growing at an unprecedented pace,” the BloombergNEF report’s lead author Yiyi Zhou said. “Falling battery costs and surging renewables penetration make energy storage a compelling flexible resource in many power systems. Energy storage projects are growing in scale, increasing in dispatch duration, and are increasingly paired with renewables.”Other regional markets to watch out for include India, Australia, Germany, the UK and Japan, BloombergNEF said, with common drivers like supportive policies, commitments on climate and the growing need for flexible energy resources likely to drive deployments in each. The Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region lags behind Asia-Pacific and the Americas, which the analysis group highlighted as being perhaps surprising due to the strong climate targets set in Europe in particular. However if the energy transition picks up pace in EMEA with the growth of renewables and retirement of fossil fuels, as well as localisation of battery supply chains, there could be acceleration in the energy storage market there, too. The Asia-Pacific region is going to deploy more megawatts of storage, but the Americas more megawatt-hours: projects in the Americas tend to be longer in duration of storage, BloombergNEF said and this dynamic will continue throughout the decade. ",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bloombergnef-global-energy-storage-outlook-2021.png

Credit: Baxter Asia PacificDialysis care solutions developer Baxter Asia Pacific has rolled out an online resource portal to support patients living with chronic kidney disease in Indonesia.The My Kidney Journey website hosts information on CKD, such as symptoms, causes, and stages, as well as the latest information on multiple treatment options to manage the disease, including Peritoneal Dialysis at home, in-centre dialysis care, and kidney transplant.The portal also provides patients, families and caregivers insights on ways to live well on dialysis, such as coping with emotional difficulties of diagnosis and demands of treatment.WHY IT MATTERSThe repository on CKD resources cannot come any sooner as cases of the disease is increasing within APAC, Baxter claims. Specifically in Indonesia, CKD afflicted over 185,000 patients in 2019 with about 69,000 new cases being recorded each year and rising, according to the Indonesia Renal Registry.Dr Aida Lydia Sutranto, consultant nephrologist at Dr Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, stressed that the lack of information ""causes patients to be unprepared for kidney replacement therapy and confused in choosing the appropriate treatment modality"". The website has been launched in 10 APAC countries and in nine different languages.THE LARGER TRENDIn July last year, pharmaceutical giant Otsuka introduced a similar platform called NephU which provides a host of online resources about nephrology conditions, including video, audio, webinars and podcasts. The site also connects clinicians with one another and with patients to enable collaboration and information sharing.Meanwhile, another APAC-wide website was recently launched to provide learning resources on ​​osteoporosis.

She said there was no animosity involved in her exit but rather to give her room to start a new chapter in her career and grow.“Being in the band  took a toll on me on so many levels and I have reached a stage where I cannot carry the burden any further. I have constantly found myself under the pressure of being the only girl in the band and having to live up t0 certain expectations.“Even after flying solo in 2013, it has been somewhat difficult to cut through the clutter without the shadow of the Malaika cloud following me every step of the way. It has been to my benefit in some instances and my downfall in some,” read part of the statement.Malaika, best known for hit song Destiny, consisted of Tshedi, Bongani Nchang and the late Jabulani Ndaba.Tshedi went on to wish Bongani well in his career, granting him liberty to replace her, and said she would continue thriving in her career as a singer, businesswoman and social activist while juggling motherhood.“If there is one thing  being part of Malaika has taught me over the years it is that life is too short to not chase any dream a person might have.

"Space Debris Threatened Crew Of ISS - Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty
The United States has condemned Russia for conducting a “dangerous and irresponsible” missile test that blew up a defunct Russian satellite, creating a debris cloud that endangered the International Space Station (ISS) and will pose a threat to space activities for years.The anti-satellite missile test on November 15 generated more than 1,500 pieces of trackable orbital debris and will likely generate hundreds of thousands of pieces of smaller orbital debris, U.S. officials said. According to NASA, the test blew up one of Russia's own satellites, creating debris that forced the crew aboard the space station -- four Americans, a German, and two Russians -- to shelter into their docked spaceship capsules for two hours as a precaution to allow for a quick evacuation had it been necessary.Officials in Russia have not said anything about the U.S. assertions that it was a Russian anti-satellite test that resulted in the ISS crew having to take shelter. Russian space agency Roskosmos said on November 16 that its ""main priority has been, and remains, to ensure the unconditional safety of the crew"" of the space laboratory orbiting at an altitude of about 420 kilometers.The agency was continuing to ""monitor the situation in order to prevent and counter all possible threats to the safety” of the ISS and its crew, it said in a statement.In a statement on November 15, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned: “The long-lived debris created by this dangerous and irresponsible test will now threaten satellites and other space objects that are vital to all nations’ security, economic, and scientific interests for decades to come.""“In addition, it will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station and other human spaceflight activities,” he added. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said he was “outraged” at the alleged Russian anti-satellite test.""With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts,"" Nelson said in a statement.“Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station and the taikonauts on board,” he added.U.S. Space Command said its initial assessment was that the debris will remain in orbit for years and potentially for decades, posing a long-term threat to the ISS and more than 3,000 active satellites from multiple nations.The target of the Russian missile was a 1982 Soviet signals intelligence satellite that has been defunct for several decades, according to space industry analysis company Seradata.The test highlights a growing space arms race among global powers, encompassing everything from systems to counter missile defense systems to anti-satellite operations.In a sign of the strategic nature of the test, Space Command said Russia is developing and deploying capabilities to deny access to and use of space by the United States and its allies. “Russia's tests of direct-ascent anti-satellite weapons clearly demonstrate that Russia continues to pursue counterspace weapon systems that undermine strategic stability and pose a threat to all nations,” said Space Command commander James Dickinson. ""Russia, despite its claims of opposing the weaponization of outer space, is willing to jeopardize the long-term sustainability of outer space,” Blinken said, adding that the United States was discussing its response with partners.At the UN General Assembly in September last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested an agreement among space powers to prohibit the placement of weapons in space, as well as the threat or use of force against outer space objects.Anti-satellite weapons are high-tech missiles possessed by few nations.India was the last to carry out a test on a target in 2019, in a move strongly criticized by other powers, including the United States.The United States shot down a satellite in 2008 in response to China demonstrating a similar capability in 2007.The U.S. and India tests were carried at much lower altitudes -- well below the International Space Station -- than the one conducted by Russia.RFE/RL journalists report the news in 27 languages in 23 countries where a free press is banned by the government or not fully established.

One researcher, Juliet Brophy, said the narrow tunnels and crevices within the cavernous system calls for creative methods to excavate fossils.When recreational cave explorers stumbled upon fossils on the surface of the Rising Star caves in South Africa, they unknowingly introduced archaeologists to an anthropological gold mine.In the years since their discovery, researchers spent countless hours excavating and studying remains from the cave. What they found helps fill in the blanks about how the early human ancestor Homo naledi lived over 300,000 years ago.LSU biological anthropology professor Juliet Brophy published details about how this early human species behaved, matured and evolved in the scientific journal PaleoAnthropology earlier this month. Her team made a rare discovery: the skull and teeth of a Homo naledi child who died 250,000 years ago somewhere between age 4 and 6.She said researchers named the child Leti, short for “Letimela” which means “the lost one” in Setswana, a language spoken in the region.Brophy was one researcher on a team of 21 international archaeologists and paleoanthropologists who examined the child’s 28 skull fragments and six teeth.“This is the first partial skull of a child of Homo naledi ever recovered, and this begins to give us insight into all stages of life of this remarkable species,” she said.Brophy said researchers found the fossils in a remote part of the cave, 39 feet away from other Homo naledi remains, which suggests someone placed the child’s body there on purpose. Because Leti’s remains have no signs of carnivore or scavenging damage, the team had to hypothesize how Leti’s skull came to rest, alone, in such a narrow, inaccessible part of the cave.“We believe that members of the same species, of the same community, put Leti that far into the cave,” Brophy said.Guy Berger, a professor at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, led the team through the cave system.“The discovery of a single skull of a child, in such a remote location within the cave system adds mystery as to how these many remains came to be in these remote, dark spaces of the Rising Star Cave system,” Berger said. “It is just another riddle among many that surround this fascinating extinct human relative.”Brophy was 34 years old when Berger hired her to analyze the first Homo naledi remains in 2014 with a team of early career scientists. They determined the fossils needed to be classified as a new species.“Naming a newfound species was simply incredible,” she said. “We saw such an interesting mix of features in these remains that we couldn’t classify them as any known species. It was like putting a puzzle together.”The initial discovery, first announced in 2015, comprises 1,550 specimens belonging to at least 15 different individuals spanning several age groups. Brophy said finding a skull like Leti’s is extremely rare, as juvenile remains are notoriously thin and fragile.Berger said studying the ancestral remnants raises questions about the current understanding of human history.“Homo naledi is clearly a primitive species, existing at a time when previously we thought only modern humans were in Africa,” he said. “Its very presence at that time and in this place complexifies our understanding of who did what first concerning the invention of complex stone tool cultures and even ritual practices.”Brophy said the Rising Star cave system is one of the richest sites of discovery for hominin fossils in the world. She said researchers are still navigating and excavating the cave system in hopes of figuring out whether or not the caves were used as Homo naledi’s burial grounds.She said Leti, along with the 15 other individuals they’ve found, unlocks a view into the world before modern humans, a world that might include rituals like the ones still practiced today.Email Caroline Savoie at CSavoie@TheAdvocate.com or follow her on Twitter at @CarolineSavo.Purchases made via links on our site may earn us an affiliate commission",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/9f/19f9486e-4337-11ec-9ee1-7370a6196170/618d8c969d6bd.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C900,"If an asteroid really threatened the Earth, what would a planetary defense mission look like? - Space.com
Someday, tucked away gathering dust in a nondescript warehouse, there will perhaps be a spacecraft waiting to be called to the launch pad, even as its builders pray it never flies.It wouldn't be a typical spacecraft, kitted out with as many high-tech instruments as engineers can cram aboard, and it wouldn't be designed to tease apart a single scientific mystery. Instead, it would be assigned a far more somber task: to deflect an asteroid on course to hit Earth.Today, there is no such asteroid, although scientists are tracking more than 27,000 rocks rattling around Earth's neighborhood of space. But experts in the field they call planetary defense know that just such an object killed off most of the dinosaurs, and they're determined to see to it that humans don't meet the same fate. The solution? Nudge any threatening asteroid just enough to avoid the collision.Related: Now, the first-ever planetary defense spacecraft is at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, waiting for its first launch opportunity early on Nov. 24 (late Nov. 23 local time). That mission, NASA's , is doomed to spend less than a year in space and make a stunning exit by slamming into the moonlet of an asteroid called Didymos. If all goes well, it will give planetary defense specialists their first real-world data about deflecting space rocks.""It's not a new problem: people have known this is something that is a potential hazard, and people have been wanting to take steps to prevent this in the future,"" Nancy Chabot, a planetary scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland and the coordination lead for DART, told Space.com. ""Probably this was a gleam in people's eyes for a long time.""There's , but DART is testing the kinetic impactor technique — a fancy way of saying that if you slam an orbiting asteroid head-on with something massive enough at a fast enough speed, the asteroid's orbit changes. First, it slows down, but that means it falls toward the object it's orbiting. Through a nifty trick of physics, the closer orbit makes for a slightly faster orbit than the rock's original path.DART will crash all of its 1,210 pounds (550 kilograms) into an object called Dimorphos, which is a small moonlet orbiting its  parent asteroid Didymos. ""DART's target is really well chosen,"" Chabot said. She's speaking for the mission team; if you were Dimorphos, you might disagree.Scientists believe that both rocks in the system are the most common flavor of near-Earth asteroid, stony or S-type. At 2,560 feet (780 meters), Didymos is about as wide as a particularly lofty skyscraper is tall; Dimorphos is more like the size of the Great Pyramid in Egypt, at about 530 feet (160 m) across.That size is particularly tempting for planetary defense specialists, who class asteroids into three categories. The largest ones, more than 3,300 feet (1,000 m) wide, could cause the most damage, but they're also the easiest to find, so scientists are pretty confident they've seen most of them. None are a threat. The smallest asteroids aren't hefty enough to cause much damage; some don't even survive the trek through Earth's atmosphere.The middle category, of rocks more than 460 feet (140 m) but less than 3,300 feet across — that's what worries planetary defense experts. These asteroids are harder to spot than the largest ones, but could still cause regional devastation if one hit Earth. Dimorphos matches that size perfectly.The DART team also wanted to target a moonlet orbiting a larger asteroid instead of an asteroid orbiting the sun. That choice was in part for convenience and in part out of caution. For one, the DART leaders are confident that nudging this object isn't going to accidentally send anything hurtling toward Earth, worsening the very problem the team is trying to work toward solving.And whereas a single asteroid orbits every few years perhaps, Dimorphos orbits Didymos once every 12 hours or so. The DART team expects the impact will shave perhaps 10 minutes or so off that rhythm — a difference that is much more noticeable against a 12-hour orbit and can be clocked more quickly.DART's observations will be the first real-world data that would-be planetary defenders can feed into the models that tell them just how big a spacecraft going just how fast might be enough to ward off an asteroid.That's the sort of work that Brent Barbee, an aerospace engineer at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, specializes in. Barbee designs hypothetical spacecraft missions, in particular for the practice scenarios the planetary defense community runs through , held every two years.""The results from the DART mission are going to be informing our hypothetical work on planetary defense going forward in numerous ways,"" Barbee said. ""It's going to be affecting the way we think about planetary defense mission design for many years to come, so the importance of the mission in that regard really can't be understated.""Scientists in the planetary defense community are quick to note that no one can deflect a threat that isn't detected, and the more warning time Earthlings have, the better the situation will turn out for us.Warning time is vital for an approach like DART's kinetic impactor because the change expected in an asteroid's orbit is fairly small, so the asteroid needs to make a few loops of the sun to build up a difference from its original position's impact with Earth. ""When you've got a couple decades' worth of warning time, the kinetic impactor can be quite sufficient to get the job done,"" Barbee said.With enough warning, even more possibilities open up, Chabot noted — like sending a spacecraft to scout out the threat and hone the deflection mission.""When you have the warning time, one of the first things that you do is you go get a better look at what this thing looks like so you know what you're dealing with,"" she said. ""The first thing that you send to this asteroid might not be the one that you're looking to deflect it with.""Scientists can only learn so much about any given space rock from Earth: its orbit, a vague size estimate, perhaps a fuzzy idea of its shape and composition. All of those factors affect the design of an optimal planetary defense mission.""That would be useful information that we don't have very much for DART,"" Chabot said. ""That makes it actually maybe a little more challenging than if you had a longer warning time.""In a real planetary defense scenario, a particularly crucial use of warning time would have nothing to do with asteroids and would instead focus on humans.Whether or not there's still time to try to stave off the space rock, international conversations will be vital. Some countries may be hit, some countries may be able to act to stop the impact, some countries may see collateral effects, and all countries ought to be involved in the planet's response, planetary defense experts emphasize.But unlike a situation like a pandemic or climate change, there are no formal, specialized international organizations to tackle such an unlikely catastrophe, Alissa Haddaji, a faculty member teaching space law, policy and ethics at Harvard College in Massachusetts, told Space.com. Instead, the U.N. Security Council would be in charge; that's one reason why planetary defense experts focus so much on communication with other communities.Legally, planetary defense is particularly tricky because one potential deflection technique relies on nuclear explosives, yet nuclear weapons are not permitted in space. Laying the groundwork for conversations that could work around such rules and international nuclear fears is a key focus for Haddaji.""The joke that I make with my colleagues is that my planetary defense research has a 99.99999% of not being useful ever — or 0.00001% chance of being extremely helpful one day,"" Haddaji said.As the field of planetary defense has developed, she noted, it has become more interdisciplinary, with ties to not just science and spacecraft engineering, but also international law and . For one example, she leads a group of lawyers that advises planetary defense scientists on legal implications and complications of the work.Even when a threat is hypothetical, communication is vital, she said, because if people are aware of the idea of an asteroid impact, there's a lower chance that news of an incoming object would terrify them into paralysis. But planetary defense experts are also wary of sounding too loud an alarm.""You don't want to go into this scaring the population, and especially not using scare tactics to raise funding to get money for planetary defense, that's not something anyone of us would ever agree to do,"" Haddaji said.Say all those conversations come to the conclusion that some coalition of humans will attempt to deflect the threatening asteroid. It's time to design a mission to save the world.The kinetic impactor approach is only one technique that planetary defense specialists consider for moving an asteroid's path. Other options may be to use lasers, a companion spacecraft's gravity or a nuclear explosion. Which option makes the most sense when needed will depend on the warning time Earth has and the size of the asteroid.Sometimes, a deflection will even require more than one mission, increasing the difficulty of the project. Any one launch will require two pieces: rocket and spacecraft.Whether there really would be a spacecraft stashed away in case of a foreseen asteroid apocalypse is one of the many choices that planetary defense experts want the planet to consider.""Would we still do a build-on-demand approach, or would we prefer to maybe do a modular build?"" Barbee said. ""Or would we have an entire spacecraft basically built and put in a warehouse or something? That's also a question mark.""Ditto for finding the thrust to launch. ""One of the things that would be really helpful would be to take a look at the processes involved in getting rockets ready for launch because typically that's not done in a hasty fashion,"" Barbee said. ""Let's say you had less time: under current procedures it would be quite a scramble to get a rocket ready for launch in time.""And of course, the logistical problems multiply if a deflection were to require a series of launches. So does the risk of something going wrong — although that's a possibility that would-be planetary defenders would always need to evaluate.A host of nightmare scenarios can unfold. Take, for example, a partial deflection, one that . ""It's still heading toward the Earth, but now the impact point is somewhere other than where it was before,"" Barbee said. ""Now we've artificially created a different version of the disaster, different from what the natural version was going to be.""Or if a mass estimate is off, or the asteroid doesn't respond as predicted. ""It's plausible that you could inadvertently break off a chunk of the asteroid when you hit it rather than just deflecting it as a whole unbroken object,"" Barbee said. Those fragments would then pose their own threats.— 
— 
— So that spacecraft in a warehouse had better have a companion. ""You wouldn't just send one,"" Chabot said. ""You maybe would want to send one and then send another one that would arrive like a few weeks later, see how the first one did and see if you needed to push it a little bit more or push it a little bit less.""The $330 million DART mission, in fact, does have a successor that plans to visit the scene. The European Space Agency will launch a spacecraft named Hera in 2024, after the dust has settled, to allow scientists to understand in even more detail the factors that a real planetary defense mission may need to consider.""This isn't the answer of exactly what you would do,"" Chabot said.

Edited by Roberta L. Rudnick, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, and approved September 29, 2021 (received for review March 26, 2021)Understanding when and how subaerial continental crust first formed is crucial, as it likely played a critical role in establishing Earth’s habitability. Although debated, the broad consensus is that the subaerial rise of continents began ∼2.5 billion years ago and was driven by plate tectonics. Here, we integrate the igneous and sedimentary history of Archean cratons to demonstrate that stable continental landmasses started to emerge above sea level 3.3 to 3.2 billion years ago (i.e., over 700 million years earlier than most models predict). We also demonstrate that these initial episodes of continental emersion were driven by voluminous granitoid magmatism in non–plate tectonic settings that formed ∼50-km-thick, silica-rich crust, which rose above the oceans due to isostasy.When and how Earth's earliest continents—the cratons—first emerged above the oceans (i.e., emersion) remain uncertain. Here, we analyze a craton-wide record of Paleo-to-Mesoarchean granitoid magmatism and terrestrial to shallow-marine sedimentation preserved in the Singhbhum Craton (India) and combine the results with isostatic modeling to examine the timing and mechanism of one of the earliest episodes of large-scale continental emersion on Earth. Detrital zircon U-Pb(-Hf) data constrain the timing of terrestrial to shallow-marine sedimentation on the Singhbhum Craton, which resolves the timing of craton-wide emersion. Time-integrated petrogenetic modeling of the granitoids quantifies the progressive changes in the cratonic crustal thickness and composition and the pressure–temperature conditions of granitoid magmatism, which elucidates the underlying mechanism and tectonic setting of emersion. The results show that the entire Singhbhum Craton became subaerial ∼3.3 to 3.2 billion years ago (Ga) due to progressive crustal maturation and thickening driven by voluminous granitoid magmatism within a plateau-like setting. A similar sedimentary–magmatic evolution also accompanied the early (>3 Ga) emersion of other cratons (e.g., Kaapvaal Craton). Therefore, we propose that the emersion of Earth’s earliest continents began during the late Paleoarchean to early Mesoarchean and was driven by the isostatic rise of their magmatically thickened (∼50 km thick), buoyant, silica-rich crust. The inferred plateau-like tectonic settings suggest that subduction collision–driven compressional orogenesis was not essential in driving continental emersion, at least before the Neoarchean. We further surmise that this early emersion of cratons could be responsible for the transient and localized episodes of atmospheric–oceanic oxygenation (O2-whiffs) and glaciation on Archean Earth.Author contributions: P.C. and J.A.M. designed research; P.C., J.A.M., S.B., S.R., A.N.W., and S.M. performed research; P.C., J.A.M., P.A.C., and O.N. analyzed data; and P.C., J.A.M., P.A.C., and O.N. wrote the paper.The authors declare no competing interest.This article is a PNAS Direct Submission.This article contains supporting information online at .Published under the PNAS license.Please click here to log into the PNAS submission website.Thank you for your interest in spreading the word on PNAS.NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

Nikolay Dokholyan, G. Thomas Passananti Professor, Penn State College of Medicine, and his colleagues—including Yashavantha Vishweshwaraiah, postdoctoral scholar in pharmacology, Penn State—created a transistor-like 'logic gate,' which is a type of computational operation in which multiple inputs control an output.
""Our logic gate is just the beginning of what you could call cellular computing,"" he said, ""but it is a major milestone because it demonstrates the ability to embed conditional operations in a protein and control its function, said Dokholyan. ""It will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of human biology and disease and introduces possibilities for the development of precision therapeutics.""
The team's logic gate comprised two sensor domains designed to respond to two inputs—light and the drug rapamycin. The team targeted the protein focal adhesion kinase (FAK) because it is involved in cell adhesion and movement, which are initial steps in the development of metastatic cancer.
""First, we introduced a rapamycin-sensitive domain, called uniRapr, which the lab had previously designed and studied, into the gene that encodes FAK,"" said Vishweshwaraiah. ""Next, we introduced the domain, LOV2, which is sensitive to light. Once we optimized both domains, we combined them into one final logic-gate design.""
The team inserted the modified gene into HeLa cancer cells and, using confocal microscopy, observed the cells in vitro. They studied the effects of each of the inputs separately, as well as the combined effects of the inputs, on the cells' behavior.
They discovered that not only could they rapidly activate FAK using light and rapamycin, but also that this activation resulted in the cells undergoing internal changes that enhanced their adhesive capabilities, which ultimately decreased their motility.
Their results published today (Nov. 16) in the journal Nature Communications.
""We show for the first time that we can build a functioning nanocomputing agent within living cells that can control cell behavior,"" said Vishweshwaraiah. ""We also discovered some interesting features of the FAK protein, such as the changes it triggers in cells when it is activated.""

"Vivo rolls out latest addition to Y-series portfolio - ITWeb
Chinese smartphone brand Vivo is expanding its Y-series smartphone portfolio in the local market with its latest addition, the Y33s.Since making its official local debut in 2019, Vivo has rolled out a number of devices in the local market, including the Y21s, Y11, Y1S, as well as its 5G-powered V21 smartphone.In a statement, Vivo says consumers can purchase the Y33s from Vodacom and MTN stores, starting at a recommended retail price of R5 999. It will also be available on postpaid deals from R299 and R329, on both 24- and 36-month options, it adds. Vivo describes the Y33s as the “ultimate photography” smartphone, saying it features a 50MP ultra-clear main camera.The smartphone is equipped with a 16MP front-facing camera, night selfie noise cancelling technology, as well as smart screen flash for better selfies in any light setting.

Before the likes of Netflix and Spotify successfully adopted a model of streaming media content to users via a subscription-based service, Xbox Game Pass was set to begin life as a video game rental platform. Speaking to British GQ, Microsoft's head of gaming ecosystems Sarah Bond explained that Xbox Game Pass may have originally looked rather different. The studio's decision to launch as a streaming-based subscription service came in part due to the successes seen by other companies using the model – turning a rental service codenamed Arches into the game subscription service we know as Game Pass.It also helped the company to build into another phenomenon in the industry – the longer duration over which games were generating revenue. “Something like 75 percent of a game’s revenue used to be made in the first two months of release,” explains Bond. “Nowadays it’s spread over two years.” Game Pass allows the company to offer the games themselves at an attractive price point for players, while expansions or other post-launch transactions remain valuable.Bond went on to reveal that the idea of a video game subscription service was initially met with strong resistance from publishers, who believed that Game Pass would devalue games. When Xbox initially launched Game Pass in June 2017, it launched with a number of low-risk older games that publishers had granted the studio access to in order to test how profitable the service would actually be. As per GQ, Xbox found that engagement from players surpassed all its estimates - a factor that eventually led to the company releasing an Xbox Studios project, Sea of Thieves, onto the platform at the same time as it launched to wider retailers, seeing continued success up to now, and encouraging it to release all new first-party games into the service, as well as attracting publisher support.Earlier this year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed that Game Pass . Subsequent reports from Microsoft have suggested that , however, the company will likely be hoping that a strong November lineup for Game Pass including the likes of Forza Horizon 5, It Takes Two, and GTA San Andreas, will help to remedy the situation.

Head of Xbox Phil Spencer has all but confirmed that The Elder Scrolls VI will be an Xbox console exclusive.In an interview with British GQ, Spencer said that he sees the sequel to Skyrim as a similar case to fellow Bethesda title Starfield, which was . At least in part, his reasoning seems to come down to what the Xbox ecosystem can offer its exclusives, including Cloud Gaming, Xbox Live services, and more:“It’s not about punishing any other platform, like I fundamentally believe all of the platforms can continue to grow,” Spencer told GQ. “But in order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about Elder Scrolls VI. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”Ever since Xbox , The Elder Scrolls 6's position as a possible exclusive has been a topic of debate. As arguably Bethesda's biggest franchise, there's been much made of  by allowing the next Elder Scrolls game to be released on competing platforms. Microsoft has previously said that Bethesda games would be , but Bethesda's Todd Howard said that it was  Now, it seems as though the pendulum has swung the other way, with Spencer sounding far more bullish about the eagerly anticipated RPG staying on Microsoft-controlled platforms.Elsewhere in the piece, Todd Howard reiterated that , but added that the ultimate goal for the game remained similar to previous installments in the series: ""You go back and you read a review of the first Elder Scrolls. And then you read The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion's, then you read The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's. You black out a couple things. And they read the same. 'You've stepped out and oh my gosh, it feels so real.' People change. Technology changes. But the ultimate goal is still to make it so that, when you boot the game up, you feel like you've been transported.”It will still be at least several years before we play the game, especially as Howard told us that , but we can expect the game to follow some familiar lines, with .Joe Skrebels is IGN's Executive Editor of News.

Lifestyle TechnologyI find it quite interesting that one of the sales pitch documents for the Tecno Camon17P (pro) bills it as “the clearest portrait camera”. That is because this claim is contrary to online sentiment about the device. Prior to receiving the device for a review, I decided to search for information on it as I had never heard about the device before. Message boards and some tweets posted earlier this year complained about the quality of images produced by the phone. I naturally became curious about this and began photographing everything I could with the device in an effort to find out if this criticism of the camera was fair upon receiving the device for a review on The Citizen. The Tecno Camon 17P boasts a 64MP AI-powered rear quad camera and a 16MP AI selfie camera with front flash. When looking at the view-finder (the phone’s screen) while taking a picture using the Camon 17P, you find yourself wondering what all the complaints were about but it quickly becomes evident when you open the gallery and find an image far blurrier than what you were trying to capture.It is unclear what causes this so I would advise taking multiple images to avoid disappointment. The Camon 17P camera does well in natural daylight and images taken outdoors or indoors using maximum natural light do look beautiful. It is under low-light conditions that the phone starts to struggle with capturing clear images, however, the phone does have a super-night feature to combat this. It is worth noting that the feature requires you (and your subject) to stay still for long enough for the image to be exposed well enough to produce a crisp image. The same notes about the camera and the photos produced applies to videos captured using this device; video captured in natural daylight – both indoors and outdoors using maximum natural light – look crisp and beautiful.Under low-light conditions, however, Camon 17P videos can look a little grainy. “Night video mode” is also available to combat this to a degree. Manufacturers also claim the device has “customisable video templates that can easily convert your everyday moments into a cinematic and creative journey,” however, I have been unable to access them thus far and have had to rely on an additional app to edit video. YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:

User experience
Overall, the phone is quite pleasant to use but it does leave a little to be desired when it comes to certain features and shortcuts available on other phones operating on the Andriod iOS. 
For example, the gallery doesn’t have a recycle bin feature so once items are deleted, they are gone for good. 
Other Camon 17P features
In addition to boasting about the phone’s photographic capabilities, manufacturers have highlighted the phone’s gaming capabilities which they say is supported by the phone’s 8 core CPU with G85 hyper-engine.
The phone has 128GB of ROM which means you will have enough space to store thousands of photos, and hundreds of apps.
“6GB RAM allows for seamless multitasking and smooth video playback giving you an uninterrupted and an effortlessly smooth experience.”

Another enjoyable feature of the Camon 17P is the device’s clear display – a 6.78-inch wide, 1080×2460 resolution screen with a 90Hz refresh rate and FHD display.
“The device renders images 90 times per second allowing fluid animation,” boasts the manufacturer before adding, “the higher the refresh rate, the better the image quality you get and the lesser the motion blurs.”
The phone uses a type C charging port, an 8-core processor, the HiOS operating system 7.6 version, 5000mAh battery and 18W flash charging (for decent battery life even with frequent use), fingerprint access and an “anti-peeping display” among other security features.

The owners of a Soweto home in which human body parts were found on Saturday were clearly irate on Monday after having their home surveilled and photographed by media, police and onlookers. The couple, who did not want to be named, said they were severely traumatised by the incident and were concerned that their small children could  be  harmed by people who thought that they were the perpetrators of the crime.By Monday afternoon, suspect Flavio Hlabangwane, 26, had appeared at the Protea magistrate’s court on a murder charge after arms and legs were found in his fridge. Police believe the rest of the body was burnt.Support independent journalism. Neighbours say Hlabangwane moved into the Protea Glen Ext 28 home last year and that they  don’t know much about him. They were familiar with his former girlfriend, who they described as tall and light in complexion — but said they had not seen her in a while.Cindi Dlamini, who lives  nearby, said she did not know the woman’s name, but that Hlabangwane had allegedly confessed the body parts were hers.“This is the last thing you’d expect in this neighbourhood. It’s quiet  most days, even though we are on the main road,” she said, pointing out the neat middle class suburban landscape.“There’s no noise here, no funny business. Just families. So I was shocked.“On Saturday I was at home when a neighbour popped in and asked me if I knew what was going on just down the road. When I looked,  there were community members outside the suspect’s home,” she said.The suspect lives in the back of the landlord’s family home, in between two other small cottages.According to neighbours, a woman had stayed over at the house on Friday night. The next morning  Hlabangwane apparently left  to buy some food. It was while he was out that the woman came across the gruesome discovery in the fridge.“The community were the first responders. This area is home to many police officers who could help the woman. “The girl,  about 20 to 21 years old, had woken up and told him she was hungry. He said there was no food in the house and went to the shops. While he was away she looked in the fridge to see if there was anything she could eat. Instead, she saw the  plastic bags.“She opened a bag and saw a hand,” said Dlamini, recounting what had happened on Saturday.The woman ran down the  road and knocked on a stranger’s door. The man, a policeman, and his friend followed her back to the house. “As residents gathered, the man drove into the yard. The policeman told him there was a complaint and asked about a hand inside the fridge. The man said: ‘What fridge? What are you talking about? There's nothing in the fridge.’ The policeman then went to look. “He tore  the plastic and saw it was a hand. He came down the steps and shouted to his friend to get handcuffs from his house and shouted at another man, ‘Go down the road and try to stop any police car you see.’ So many police live in the area.”A male neighbour, who did not want to be named, was curious and went to look inside the fridge.“I saw an arm and there was blood. It was a shock,” he said.As brave, or curious, community members inspected the home, the man was placed in handcuffs. He was then locked inside the house until authorities arrived. “He then starts stabbing his neck,”  Dlamini said.“Then he drinks Jeyes fluid [a strong caustic bleach used for cleaning] and vinegar.” The man was removed by  ambulance and spent Sunday in hospital under police  guard until he appeared  in the Protea Glen magistrate’s court on Monday afternoon. While TimesLIVE  was speaking to neighbours, a vehicle rolled slowly past. The two men in the vehicle said they had travelled from Randfontein — 18km away —  to see the suspect’s home.Hlabangwane was remanded in custody until November 22 so he can apply to Legal Aid SA for representation.Police spokesperson Brig Brenda Muridili said the  torso and head  had not been found and that police were awaiting a forensic report on the limbs for identification.“So far there is no update on that side of investigation as the accused is also still being profiled. The case has been taken over by provincial occult-related crimes investigators but the motive  for the killing is still under investigation.”Though the landlords declined an interview with TimesLIVE, they spoke to sister publication Sowetan on Sunday.They described Hlabangwane as quiet without many friends. They said they had not seen his former girlfriend for  more than a month and that he had brought over other women since.According to the publication, an officer on the scene said Hlabangwane had refused to disclose the location of the rest of the body, but they suspected he had burnt the torso and head. A petrol canister was found in his vehicle, as well as muddy and ash-stained shoes.TimesLIVEWould you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?

JOHANNESBURG - Thousands of Gauteng residents might have their water cut off in the coming days, but Rand Water said the maintenance operation was a necessary inconvenience. Parts of Gauteng including Johannesburg, Soweto, and Randburg will be affected by the reduced water supply due to the scheduled maintenance of major Rand Water pipes. Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mnchunu and Rand Water’s leadership briefed the media on Monday on the progress made.  In the briefing, Rand Water has re-emphasised that the maintenance taking place on key water infrastructure located in Vereeniging was scheduled and routine.Rand Water CEO Sipho Mosai said the benefits of this exercise were threefold.“By meeting future demands by adding new pipes. But we are also giving ourselves the opportunity to refurbish and maintain going forward. But I think it is also important to point out to people that our pipes are cross-connected. So, this is really a culmination of a plan that started in 2009.”Rand Water has reported there have been no water cuts in Gauteng yet due to its abundant reserves.WATCH: Rand Water: The maintenance is a necessary inconvenience

Godongwana has held the role for a number of  NEC terms.Speaking  a day after tabling the medium-term budget policy statement — the primary focus of which was on fiscal consolidation by cutting spending and reducing debt — he defended  wearing  both hats, saying this does not present a conflict or contradiction.As head of the subcommittee leading the discussion on economic policy at party conferences, he said he will dissuade the ANC from adopting resolutions that were too costly for government. “I must tell the ANC at the time of discussion [that the government cannot afford it]. I will debate matters in the structures of the ANC and push for consensus on policy issues that are practical and in the interests of our people.”At the ANC elective conference in 2017, former president Jacob Zuma announced outside the conference hall that the government had agreed to implement free higher education, without explaining how it would be funded.At the same conference the party resolved to explore expropriation of land without compensation. An ad hoc committee was set up in parliament and public hearings were held around the country. But disagreements with other political parties — mainly the EFF — on who should have custody of land stalled the process.Godongwana said the sooner the land expropriation debate is settled the better for investor confidence. He said that while the National Development Plan estimates that the agricultural sector had the potential to  create  a million jobs, there will be no substantial investment in the sector until the issue of expropriation without compensation is settled.“We did a similar thing in 2010. In the midst of a commodities boom we spent two years discussing whether to nationalise the mines or not and we missed the boom.”“We are doing a similar thing when we need all those jobs in agriculture and the NDP says we are likely to have a million jobs ... so the sooner we close that debate, the better for investment in that sector,” he said. TimesLIVEWould you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?
