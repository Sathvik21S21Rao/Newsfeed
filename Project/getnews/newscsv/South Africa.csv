"5 candidates who can replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Manchester United manager - IOL
Share this article:Manchester, England - has left manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer clinging to his job despite signing a new three-year deal just three months ago.Solskjaer has failed to win a trophy in nearly three years in charge at Old Trafford and tangible signs of progress after finishing second in the Premier League last season have been blown away amid a run of five defeats in their last nine games.United are already eight points off the pace at the top of the table and there is a growing consensus that they need a coach to match the calibre of Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Chelsea's Champions League winner Thomas Tuchel.Solskjaer has led United to two consecutive top-four finishes for the first time since Alex Ferguson's retirement as manager in 2013, but his time looks to be running out.AFP Sport  looks at five of the candidates to replace the 48-year-old if and when he is shown the door at Old Trafford.Antonio ConteA proven title winner, Conte turned a Chelsea side that had finished 10th the previous season into Premier League winners in his debut campaign in England in 2016/17.The Italian is without a club having left Inter Milan in May after ending their 11-year wait to win Serie A.Conte appears a perfect fit to solve United's defensive woes that have blighted their season. Solskjaer's men have kept one clean sheet in 21 games and shipped 11 goals in a week against Leicester, Atalanta and Liverpool.However, Conte's fiery temperament and tendency to fall out with his superiors could count against him.""He's not a fit for United,"" said former United captain Gary Neville on Sunday.Zinedine ZidaneExpectations were high for United to challenge for major trophies this season after the signings of serial winners Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane, along with ¬£73 million ($100 million) winger Jadon Sancho.Three of Ronaldo and Varane's Champions League titles came under Zidane at Real Madrid and the Frenchman is also a free agent having ended his second spell with the Spanish giants in May.Zidane proved himself a master of moulding a star-studded squad into a team at Madrid, where he also won two La Liga titles.That is exactly what United need and his global profile fits the brand-building exercise the English giants have gone down in recent years, at times to the detriment of a well-functioning team on the field.Brendan RodgersThe outstanding option on the domestic market for United is Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers.The Northern Irishman's past as a Liverpool manager may rule him out for many United fans, but he has rebuilt his reputation since a rollercoaster three years at Anfield between 2012 and 2015.Rodgers proved himself capable of handling the demands of winning every week in three years at Celtic, where he won a clean sweep of seven domestic trophies before returning to the Premier League with Leicester.The Foxes have narrowly missed out on the Champions League for the past two seasons to Chelsea despite far inferior resources and beat the European champions to win the FA Cup for the first time in the club's history last season.Erik Ten HagThe Dutchman is responsible for arguably the form team in Europe right now with Ajax cruising towards the last 16 of the Champions League and another Eredivisie title after thrashing PSV Eindhoven 5-0 on Sunday.Ten Haag was linked with a number of top jobs after leading the four-time European champions to the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 1997 two years ago.But unlike many of his players from that run, he is yet to be poached by one of Europe's top clubs.The former Bayern Munich youth team coach would fit the attacking style demanded of a United manager, as exhibited by a 4-0 thrashing of Borussia Dortmund last week.Luis EnriqueThe Spain coach is another with plenty of experience in getting the best out of a collection of talented individuals.He won the treble in his first season at Barcelona and added another La Liga title with a front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar.Fluent in English, Luis Enrique has never hidden his desire to one day coach in the Premier LeagueHis success with Spain this year at Euro 2020 and the Nations League finals shows he is also capable of producing an exciting side without the same quality of stars he had on offer at the Camp Nou.AFPShare this article:",https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/320/Antonio-Conteis-currently-without-a-job-Picture-Jennifer-Lorenzini-Reuters?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/78d933fb-57a5-5f9d-b170-6bbc9296dc2e&operation=CROP&offset=0x92&resize=1509x849,"Cristiano Ronaldo outlines 'blame' for Liverpool defeat as brutal Ole Gunnar Solskjaer verdict given - Liverpool.com
Welcome to the Liverpool.com daily Media Digest. From transfers to tweets, it can be hard to keep up with everything going on in the Anfield sphere. Credible, incredible and anything in between: we round it all up in one place here, taking a sideways look at the day‚Äôs media goings-on from around the world.***Cristiano Ronaldo's messageManchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo cannot have been beaten 5-0 at home that many times as a footballer, if ever.But yes, that did really happen yesterday.The Portugal star took to social media to send a message to his United teammates, writing: ""Sometimes the result is not the one we fight for. Sometimes the score is not the one we want.""And this is on us, only on us, because there‚Äôs no one else to blame. Our fans were, once again, amazing in their constant support. They deserve better than this, much better, and it‚Äôs up to us to deliver. The time is now!""The time to do that might have been 4.30pm on Sunday, actually, but Liverpool won't be complaining. Naby Ke√Øta injury updateAfter a superb performance at Old Trafford, it was so cruel that Naby Keita's afternoon ended with him leaving the pitch on a stretcher.The Guinean has not had the best fortune with staying fit during his time at Liverpool, but scored a goal and played well against Manchester United, albeit Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men were dreadful.""With Naby Ke√Øta, we have to see how serious it is,"" J√ºrgen Klopp said post-match.""It‚Äôs very painful but we‚Äôll see. We‚Äôll only know tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Naby is in a great moment. He‚Äôs an outstanding player.""Pep Lijnders will address the media ahead of the midweek trip to Preston North End on Tuesday. Liverpool will probably know more about the extent of the injury by then.Virgil van Dijk tweetIt only took two words to sum up the game from Liverpool's central defender Virgil van Dijk: ""Different class.""A simple but effective message from the Dutchman, who had little to do on the afternoon such was the gulf between the two sides.What he did do, however, was guide Ibrahima Konat√© through the game expertly, with the French defender showing his quality with a perfect display aside from being beaten for the disallowed Ronaldo strike.Liverpool and Manchester United are poles apart ‚Äî and Van Dijk's message was spot on. The sides are, ultimately, in completely different classes.Daniel Sturridge praiseAnother tweet, another simple message from a player invested in Liverpool doing well.Former striker Daniel Sturridge was left impressed with his ex-teammates on Sunday, with his message slightly longer than Van Dijk's but equally as emphatic.""The red men are looking like champions to me. Absolutely sensational in the first half,"" he posted.It's hard to argue with that statement.Former Man United man unimpressedManager Solskjaer is surely under huge pressure now, even despite the small number of matches that have been played so far this season.Surviving the boos at half-time and the resounding defeat this far has been an impressive feat.Former midfielder Bastien Schweinsteiger was not impressed by him over the weekend, though.""A devastating day for all @ManUtd supporters and the club but it didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere,"" he tweeted. ""It was not a surprise. @LFC showed them the difference, which is huge ‚Äî having a philosophy & vision. Congrats, #LiverpoolFC. Hopefully #ManchesterUnited will get back very soon.""Scathing, really. But absolutely true: Manchester United seemingly had no plan whatsoever.",https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article21959464.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1236101145.jpg,"Pakistan's Vernon Philander buzzing after thrilling win over India - IOL

"Eskom warns public to brace for power cuts for the next 10 months - IOL
Share this article:ESKOM has warned the public to brace for more power cuts for the next 10 months as the capacity outlook for the period ending August 2022 showed that the power system would remain constrained.The struggling power utility yesterday warned the public to expect an increased risk of load shedding while the reliability maintenance programme of its ageing coal fleet was being implemented.Eskom has so far implemented 32 days of loadshedding since April 1 due to increasing breakdowns and low plant availability, and currently there is a nightly Stage 2 loadshedding.Eskom‚Äôs energy available factor (EAF) has declined to 65.3 percent this financial year against a target of 70 percent, and down from the average of 67.9 percent achieved last year.As a result, Eskom needs an additional 4 000MW to 6 000MW generation capacity to eliminate the risk of loadshedding and to ensure the necessary electrical energy that is needed to stimulate the economy.It is not clear how soon the 2 000MW of emergency additional power commissioned by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy will come into the grid.Eskom group executive for generation Phillip Dukashe said a key contributor to the low EAF was high levels of planned maintenance over the summer months.Since September, Eskom has increased its planned maintenance programme to an average 5 500MW of capacity, almost double the average maintenance carried out in the same period in September 2019 to April 2020.Dukashe said the recent high levels of unplanned outages was a concern, but Eskom would continue to drive its reliability maintenance recovery programme.‚ÄúGeneration plant performance is still unreliable and unpredictable, but improvement initiatives are being driven hard to get to acceptable levels,‚Äù Dukashe said.‚ÄúWe need to ensure system stability and to meet demand a minimum 4 000MW of additional generating capacity is critical.‚ÄúThis will ensure the space for generation to continue with the planned reliability maintenance and refurbishment programme, and that the operational recovery is timeously funded and resourced to enable maximum readiness to execute successfully.‚ÄùDue to the system constraints, Eskom said it had used more than the anticipated levels of diesel for its Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGTs), spending at least R2.5 billion so far to keep the lights on.Eskom chief operations officer Jan Oberholzer said the utility would be required to extensively use the OCGTs to either avert loadshedding or to reduce the magnitude thereof.Oberholzer conceded that load shedding carries a significant damaging effect to the economy.‚ÄúWe are aware that the increased maintenance does elevate the probability of loadshedding in the short term, but this is necessary to improve the future performance of the generation fleet,‚Äù Oberholzer said.‚ÄúOur objective is to achieve a reliable and sustainable generation plant, thereby reducing the risk and frequency of the occurrence of loadshedding. As such, Eskom will not compromise on reliability maintenance and mid-life refurbishment.‚Äù[email¬†protected]BUSINESS REPORT ONLINEShare this article:",https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/320/Eskom-has-warned-the-public-to-brace-for-more-power-cuts-for-the-next-10-months-as-the-capacity-outlook-for-the-period-ending-August-2022-showed-that-the-power-system-would-remain-constrained-Photographer-Dean-Hutton-Bloomberg?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/14958be7-5ac5-5a11-9091-b6a6e0ce926b&operation=CROP&offset=0x0&resize=4000x2252,"Facebook employees use farewell messages to criticise it for not fixing its 'net negative' influence on the world - report - Business Insider South Africa
Some Facebook employees write ""badge posts"" when they leave the company as a means of farewell. Wired reports that some employees are  and their perceived impact it has on the world. The magazine -  - reported that while some employees speak accolades of Facebook via these internal farewell posts, others use them to scold the company for what they say is its wrongdoings.The badge posts, as well as other details included in the reported documents, show more evidence that people inside Facebook were concerned about the potential harm the company was publicly accused of posing. And yet, when they raised questions to leadership, nothing was done, according to Wired. A Facebook spokesperson told Insider that ""at the heart of these stories is a premise which is false.""""Yes, we're a business and we make profit, but the idea that we do so at the expense of people's safety or wellbeing misunderstands where our own commercial interests lie,"" they said.

"The right food can help beat depression, say nutritionists - IOL
Share this article:Hyderabad - Eating the right food can help beat depression effectively during difficult times, say nutritionists.Troubles linked to personal health, family situation, financial condition, and any other issue which might trigger despair during Covid-19 pandemic is likely to result in causing mental depression among those facing these situations. The common belief is that people when depressed tend to consume food in excess.However, nutritionists say eating the right food will also help people overcome depression. A Lancet report recently indicated that more and more people are suffering from depression related problems due to the after-effects of Covid-19 pandemic.Commenting on linkage between food and depression, Dr N. Malleshwari, Chief Dietician & Nutritionist, Gleneagles Global Hospital said: ""Poor food choices and selection of foods might contribute to deficiency of the nutrients which actually can result in depression. Some amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine are often helpful in treating many mild disorders including depression.""Mental depression is a serious problem that affects people around the world, and in many, this could be a life changing occurrence. ""While those who accept they are depressed, seek medical attention or counselling to overcome the condition, the best means to beat depression is to bring about lifestyle changes and start consuming a healthy diet. ‚Äô‚ÄôWhile medicines or counselling provide temporary relief, eating right food and bringing in positive lifestyle changes will help conquer the problem forever. Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA & DHA) elicit anti-depressant effects among humans and are very important to be included in diet,"" said Malleshwari.""Human bodies normally produce molecules which are called free radicals which could lead to cell damage resulting in quick ageing and cause other problems. Consuming antioxidants-rich foods and vitamins-rich fruits and vegetables will have a positive impact on the brain and certainly lessen the destructive effects of free radicals. Foods like carrots, pumpkin, spinach, oranges, tomato, nuts and seeds, will be of great help,"" said Dr Arun Kumar, Chief Dietitian, SLG Hospitals.Swetha, HoD - Nutrition, Aware Gleneagles Global Hospital believes that eating small portions of proteins several times in a day will help boost energy in the human body and will clear the mind. ""Protein-rich tuna fish, turkey, chicken have amino acids which help the human body stay alert. Beans, peas, milk, soya, yoghurt too are a good source of healthy proteins. People who are suffering from depression must ensure they do not consume alcohol, or smoke, and even cut down on caffeine intake to overcome the problem.""Overweight or obese people are more likely to suffer from depression because excess body weight will impact immune system and bring hormonal changes among both men and women. Obese individuals must immediately work on cutting down weight if they intend to overcome depression, and healthy food habits is first step in that direction. Many people who are depressed also have problems with alcohol or drugs; and these not only can interfere with mood, sleep, and motivation, they can also reduce the effectiveness of depression medications.Related video:Share this article:",https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/320/Eating-the-right-food-can-help-beat-depression-effectively-during-difficult-times-say-nutritionists-Picture-IANS?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/8c70f735-f214-5920-8f38-03593306edbf&operation=CROP&offset=0x9&resize=400x225,"Big misconception about cancer treatment in rural areas: Experts - SABC News

On October 17, Biogen announced that its anticipated antisense oligonucleotide therapy, Tofersen, failed to achieve its primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III VALOR study (NCT02623699) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Tofersen inhibits the production of mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein, which is linked to toxic effects on the motor neurons in the disease. Although Tofersen is being studied for a limited sub-group of ALS disease caused by SOD1 mutations, accounting for only 2% of the total ALS population, this news is hugely disappointing as the drug was believed to be the next breakthrough therapy for this subset of patients.
Key opinion leaders (KOLs) previously interviewed by GlobalData stated that despite targeting a small population of ALS patients, Tofersen could pave the way for the increased development of precision medicine approaches that offer disease-modifying benefits for specific genetic subsets of ALS disease. Tofersen‚Äôs mechanism of action was highly regarded by KOLs, but some had concerns about the drug‚Äôs ability to replicate positive results from earlier trials in larger Phase III trials, a fear which has since played out. This setback will likely hinder Biogen‚Äôs planned filing for FDA approval in the ALS market. However, it is possible the company may take a similar approach as it did with its Alzheimer‚Äôs disease asset, Aduhelm (aducanumab), and still pursue an accelerated approval using some modestly encouraging data from the secondary endpoints of the trial.
Topline results from the Phase III VALOR study demonstrated that after 28 weeks of therapy, patients did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint assessed by the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) compared to placebo. However, Biogen insists that the company will not close the door entirely on its ALS programme considering multiple positive secondary and exploratory endpoints, including the reduction of neurofilament (NF), a biomarker correlated with neurodegeneration, as well as SOD1 protein levels. Additionally, the combined data from VALOR and the ongoing open-label extension portion of the study suggested that Tofersen showed signs of slowing disease progression, particularly in patients who started treatment early.




Despite the disappointing news, a glimpse of hope remains for Tofersen and ALS patients with SOD1 mutations. Firstly, as mentioned previously, it is possible that Biogen may still pursue FDA approval based on secondary endpoint data. Additionally, patients may be able to receive the treatment prior to approval via an ongoing early access programme. Finally, as an early therapeutic intervention within the pre-symptomatic stage of ALS is thought to massively impact therapy outcomes, Biogen is currently exploring the efficacy of Tofersen in delaying disease onset in the Phase III ATLAS trial (NCT04856982). Although a promising direction for Tofersen, recruiting the right patients will remain a significant challenge, due to the rarity of the disease and the limited subset of target patients.
																												
														
										            
Tofersen is the second high-profile pipeline asset to fail a Phase III trial for ALS this year, following the failure of Orphazyme‚Äôs arimoclomol in May 2021. These failures capture the historical struggle to develop disease-modifying treatments for this rare disease. The high failure rate in ALS clinical trials may be attributed to the disease‚Äôs unclear etiology and lack of specific biomarkers. Currently, the only treatment options available for ALS are Rilutek (riluzole) and Radicava (edaravone), neither of which can stop or significantly slow the progression of the disease. Therefore, significant opportunities remain for pharmaceutical companies to address.

Topline results from the Phase III VALOR study demonstrated that after 28 weeks of therapy, patients did not demonstrate statistically significant improvements in the primary endpoint assessed by the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) compared to placebo. However, Biogen insists that the company will not close the door entirely on its ALS programme considering multiple positive secondary and exploratory endpoints, including the reduction of neurofilament (NF), a biomarker correlated with neurodegeneration, as well as SOD1 protein levels. Additionally, the combined data from VALOR and the ongoing open-label extension portion of the study suggested that Tofersen showed signs of slowing disease progression, particularly in patients who started treatment early.

"Let there be herd ‚Äì IMIESA - IMIESA
 Without social life there would be no ‚Äúhigher‚Äù life at all.  Even the first multicellular people were social associations.  Being together gave them advantages over unicellulars.   That was more than two billion years ago.  Since then, cooperation has been one of the basic principles of life.   Among other things, because Darwin‚Äôs thesis of the ‚Äústruggle for existence‚Äù has often been interpreted as a dumb ‚Äúeveryone against everyone‚Äù, new references to this are received with surprise again and again.   This also includes now known finds that suggest that dinosaurs are already 40 lived in herds millions of years earlier than previously known and may have shown complex social behavior.  At least this is the conclusion drawn by a team led by Diego Pol, paleontologist at the Museo Paleontol√≥gico Egidio Feruglio in Trelew.  The latter is a city in the Argentine part of Patagonia.  The finds also come from the area: 192 Millions of years old bones of no less than 80 individuals of Mussaurus patagonicus, plus about 100 Fossilized eggs including embryos of the same species.  Pol and his colleagues have been digging at a small site in the Magellan Basin in southern Patagonia since the beginning of the millennium.  The finds came together over all these years.  One of the early surprises was that Mussaurus ‚Äì which means ‚Äúmouse dinosaur‚Äù ‚Äì was anything but mouse-sized.   He got his name after the first discoveries.  They were tiny.  In the meantime, however, it is clear that these were young animals that had just hatched.  The total find now paints a picture of a very ‚Äúsociable‚Äù animal species, from eggs that were laid in breeding holes dug close together, groups of young animals that died together and close together to fully grown dinosaurs that were sometimes found in pairs.  This is what the researchers write in their article in the magazine ‚ÄúScientific Reports‚Äù.  One reason why this type of social life developed in them could have been the mouse size of the young animals.  Because it was only a few million years before the early Jurassic period, from which the finds originate, that species corresponding to our picture of prehistoric giants emerged.  The forerunners were comparatively small.  What remained small for a long time, however, were evidently the eggs, which in Mussaurus were about the same size as those of chickens.   Pol and his colleagues have the hypothesis that the offspring had to eat a lot in a short time and be well protected in order to To have some chance of reaching the more than 1000 kilograms of an adult animal at some point.  The fact that some of the animals found apparently died together can be due to a drought have been lying.  It was probably accompanied by a storm that covered the starved Mussaurs with dust and would be one of the reasons why they can be found today.

As big as a car, with its camera ‚Äúhead‚Äù rising high, Perseverance‚Äôs six-wheeled lookalike towers over most visitors, while Ingenuity‚Äôs double highlights just how small the history-making rotorcraft is. The tour begins in October at venues on the East and West Coasts, then works its way inland.  Since landing on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, Perseverance has been hunting for signs of ancient microscopic life in order to collect and store samples of Martian rock and sediment to be retrieved by planned future missions for closer study on Earth. After hitching a ride to Mars on Perseverance‚Äôs belly, the Ingenuity helicopter has completed more than a dozen short flights, not only proving that powered, controlled flight is possible on Mars, but even helping scout potential locations for Perseverance to explore. In addition to the spacecraft models, NASA Perseverance and Ingenuity scientists and engineers will give in-person and virtual talks and answer questions at various museums. The in-person events will include live activities at three venues to coincide with the one-year anniversary of Perseverance landing on Mars. Some exhibits will include digital displays with video, latest images, and sounds from the Martian surface to provide an authentic sample of what the rover is encountering as it explores the Red Planet. Another feature at some museums will be family-friendly science exhibits, such as smaller-scale rover models and tabletop displays, rock collections, spacecraft materials, and interactive selfie stations.

SpaceX is ""go"" to launch its spooky space station mission this weekend ‚Äî as long as a toilet issue gets cleared up in time.No showstoppers were found during a flight readiness review (FRR) for the company's Crew-3 mission, which will send four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Crew-3 therefore remains on track to lift off early on Halloween morning (Oct. 31), NASA and SpaceX announced Monday (Oct. 25).""We had a good review today,"" Joel Montalbano, NASA's ISS program manager, said during a news conference Monday evening after the FRR wrapped up.¬†The review revealed no surprises, Montalbano said. But that doesn't mean the NASA and SpaceX teams aren't working on any issues. Indeed, they need to resolve one outstanding item before Crew-3 can lift off ‚Äî a slight redesign of .That tweak was prompted by an issue experienced on SpaceX's Inspiration4 mission, which sent four private citizens on a three-day trip to orbit last month. After that capsule, named Resilience, returned home, inspections revealed that a tube hooked up to a toilet storage tank had popped loose during flight.¬†This ""allowed urine to not go into the storage tank but, essentially, to go into the fan system,"" Bill Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during Monday's news conference. But the leak didn't markedly affect Inspiration4, he added.""We didn't really even notice it; the crew didn't notice it until we got back"" to Earth, Gerstenmaier said.Still, SpaceX decided to revamp the toilet system on the Crew-3 capsule, known as Endurance, going with an all-welded structure to eliminate tube pop-offs, Gerstenmaier said. NASA needs to give the redesign a final thumbs-up before Crew-3 can fly, but that is expected to happen in the coming days.The toilet issue could potentially apply to another Crew Dragon: the capsule known as Endeavour, which flew SpaceX's Crew-2 mission and is still docked to the ISS. Endeavour is scheduled to come back to Earth with the four Crew-2 astronauts soon ‚Äî¬†on Nov. 4, if Crew-3 launches on time.Astronauts on the orbiting lab have examined Endeavour, looking for signs of corrosion caused by leaked urine (or rather, by an additive that SpaceX puts into the Crew Dragon septic system to remove ammonia from urine). They haven't found anything troublesome, and analyses by teams here on Earth indicate that all should be well for Crew-2's return, Gerstenmaier said.He also noted that leakage on Crew-2 was likely significantly lower than on Inspiration4, given that crewmembers used Endeavour's toilet only during its 24-hour trip to the space station rather than for three full days.‚Äî

‚ÄîCrew-3 is scheduled to launch atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 2:21 a.m. EDT (0621 GMT) on Sunday. You can watch the liftoff live here at Space.com courtesy of NASA, or directly via the space agency.The mission will send four spaceflyers to the orbiting lab for a six-month stay: NASA astronauts Raja Chari (mission commander), Tom Marshburn and Kayla Barron, along with the European Space Agency's Matthias Maurer. All are spaceflight rookies except Marshburn, who has two visits to the station under his belt.Crew-3 will mark Endurance's spaceflight debut.

"Mazda CX-3 Production For Europe Ending In December - Motor1
[UPDATE] Mazda Germany has confirmed in a phone call with Motor1.com¬†that production of the CX-3 for the European market will be terminated at the end of the year. It will continue for other markets.It was back in May when Mazda bid adieu to the CX-3 in the United States and now we're hearing the firm's smallest crossover will be going the way of the dodo in Europe as well. Polish magazine Auto Katalog cites Szymon So≈Çtysik, Mazda Poland's head of PR, saying customers on the Old Continent better act fast because the model will be discontinued by the end of the year.Production of the CX-3 for Europe will come to a close in December, which isn't all too surprising considering Mazda now has the CX-30 in its portfolio. Frankly, we are kind of surprised the company offered both models concomitantly for about two years on Euro land since the newer crossover is the smarter choice and it's not significantly more expensive.That's not to say the CX-3 is being terminated as there's more to the world than Europe and the United States. As a matter of fact, the subcompact crossover was recently updated at home in Japan where it received a special edition with a rather awkward name ‚Äì Super Edgy. It's unclear what sort of future Mazda has in mind for the CX-3 considering the strategy chosen for the CX-5, which will peacefully coexist with the CX-50 in the US.As you're probably aware by now, the ""CX"" lineup will be growing considerably within the next two years. While the CX-50 will be mechanically related to the CX-30, the CX-60 through CX-90 models will sit on a new rear-wheel-drive platform with inline-six engines. These bigger SkyActiv-X gasoline and SkyActiv-D diesel units are being developed to support plug-in hybrid setups.Europe, Japan, and other markets will be getting the CX-60 (two-row seating) and CX-80 (three-row seating) with narrower bodies whereas the US will receive the CX-70 and CX-90 featuring wider bodies. The latter won't be sold alongside the CX-9 as the older SUV will be retired. Meanwhile, the US-only CX-50 will lead the SUV onslaught following its world premiere next month.Car Buying ServiceGet upfront price offers on local inventory.Search for:",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/7WRx1/s3/2018-mazda-cx-3.jpg,"Xiaomi launches the 11T Pro in South Africa ¬ª Stuff - Stuff Magazines

That number‚Äôs quickly increasing, with a few Chinese phone makers bringing their devices into our market. A noteworthy brand, Xiaomi, just launched the 11T Pro device in South Africa, complete with admirable specs and a decent price.¬†It‚Äôs hard to call this phone a flagship based only on specs and price ‚Äî but it‚Äôs clear that the 11T Pro offers immense value. It‚Äôs fitted with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chipset ‚Äî that‚Äôs the one you get in Samsung‚Äôs latest devices, including the S21 Ultra 5G and the Galaxy Flip 3 5G. Of course, this one‚Äôs also toting 5G capability.¬†Along with a powerful processor, you get 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage standard. Turn your gaze to the outside, and you‚Äôll find a sleek 6.67in AMOLED display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support.Then there‚Äôs the camera, which rivals other flagships that cost far more than it. The rather large camera housing (what‚Äôs new, though), holds a 108MP wide-angle main sensor, along with a tiny 8MP ultra-wide and 5MP telephoto lens. Up front you get a 16MP selfie camera.We haven‚Äôt even gotten to the major selling point yet ‚Äî the Xiaomi 11T Pro is fitted with a 5,000mAh battery that you can charge up to full in just 17 minutes using the bundled charger. The monstrous 120W HyperCharge charger is probably bigger than your laptop‚Äôs power brick, but at least this smartphone box features a charger.¬†The second-biggest selling point is the price. While competitors sell phones featuring similar specs at R20k+, this one‚Äôs living its best life at just R14,000. As part of the, buyers will even get a Mi Robot Vacuum Mop as part of the deal.¬†

Home > Tech > Getting Started ‚Äì Top Reasons Why You Should Consider Getting a VPNIn this day and age, there are plenty of reasons to get a VPN. VPNs have been around for decades. However, there‚Äôs still this stigma around buying a VPN for your PC, laptop or phone, often linked to illegal activity. But that isn‚Äôt always the case. VPNs serve a host of purposes, both for work and private households. Not all VPNs are the same either, each having its own set of features, allowing you to choose which works best for your requirement. These use cases extend beyond that of simple torrent downloads or being able to stream additional content. In addition to that, choosing a VPN and downloading it is fairly simple. You don‚Äôt need to be a computer scientist or IT technician to set it up either. You can download an easy-to-use executable file, install it, and use the default settings and you‚Äôre good to go. If, however, you wish to configure the VPN for specific regions and purposes, you also still have that option. If you still have reserved feelings about whether or not you should look at getting a VPN, we‚Äôve put together a list to help you understand why you would want/need to download one. Whenever you use the internet, you‚Äôre linking to and sharing quite a bit of information online. Further to that, your internet service provider (ISP) is able to see and monitor this traffic across its network. In most cases, this is just protocol. On other occasions, they could be actively monitoring your activity in order to restrict your online usage. Many people attempt to use private or incognito browsing, but this doesn‚Äôt prevent that information from traversing your ISP‚Äôs network. This is where a VPN comes in. Having a VPN in this scenario ‚Äòdistorts‚Äô the internet traffic by using an encrypted tunnel. This, then, means that your ISP is unable to read it. Another popular use case for VPNs is allowing you to connect to a specific network. These networks are often restricted, allowing you to access sensitive information without it being visible to anyone outside of this network. VPNs in this situation are often used by businesses to protect their information amongst their employees, especially with todays‚Äô work-from-home options. The same setup can be used for banks, universities and even the military, to name a few. There are times when you connect to a public WiFi hotspot. This could be at a friend‚Äôs house, an event, a concert and the many restaurants that offer free WiFi these days. However, these networks aren‚Äôt always as secure as you‚Äôd hope. Connecting to these networks could put you at risk of your information being stolen. To avoid this stress, you can use a VPN to prevent this by encrypting the data shared across the network. This means that anyone or anything listening in on the network may still be able to read or copy your information, but it‚Äôs pretty useless thereafter as it‚Äôs been encrypted. Region restrictions have become quite widespread in recent years. Businesses often do this to cater only to a specific market or region, for various reasons. It may not always be a legal question that they limit content from being shared in different regions, sometimes it could just be due to not wanting to offend viewers or customers knowing that a specific product or video may do this. Businesses such as Amazon, Netflix and YouTube often restrict their video content for this very reason. In other instances, it may be that it forms part of strategic marketing campaigns in those regions, only thereafter releasing content to get maximum exposure. A VPN in this instance will allow you to view content in regions where a movie or series has been released, allowing you to then stream it when selecting a VPN for that region. This could also mean that a larger base of videos will be available to watch. Although this is not a major use case for VPNs, it‚Äôs still possible. Take for example certain holidays around the world, such as Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday in the US, Single‚Äôs Day and Chinese New Year in China, Diwali in India and many others. There are quite a few more sale seasons around the world than just Christmas and Black Friday. Given that some of the online retailers don‚Äôt offer sales outside of a specific region at any one time, a VPN comes in handy during this time. You‚Äôll then have access to all those discounts that are region-restricted, maximising your buying power. For many, downloading torrents is associated with illegal downloading of series, movies, games and music. However, there‚Äôs quite a lot more to it than just that. In a few cases, when you buy certain products, you‚Äôre provided with a link to a torrent file. This can be for any of the previously mentioned. Even Microsoft allows for torrent downloading of the Windows OS iso for installation. With many ISPs blocking peer-to-peer downloads and such, you‚Äôre not always able to download torrents in any form, legal or otherwise. A VPN would make this possible, allowing you to bypass these restrictions. With the added benefit of torrents allowing you to pick up your download where you left off when the power goes out or you lose internet connectivity or battery on your laptop, torrent downloads are often preferred for large downloads.Will you be watching Ghostbusters: Afterlife?View ResultsŒîFortress of Solitude has become one of the most popular geek entertainment interest websites in South Africa and covers news and reviews on movies, games, comic books, gadgets, TV series, toys, sneakers and more.The articles on Fortress of Solitude are written by a group of talented, professional and experienced freelance writers, all experts and leaders in their various fields. 2021 Fortress of Solitude, a division of Fortress Entertainment.

A video that plays at the end of the recently launched The Dark Pictures: House of Ashes has revealed The Devil in Me, the ""season one finale"" of Supermassive Games ' The Dark Pictures Anthology. This reveals not only what the next game in the anthology will be, but that the series will be split into seasons. The Dark Pictures Anthology: The Devil in Me The trailer, which can be seen in the Tweet from TheHunters above, reveals a grotesque tease of The Devil in Me, which appears to involve a killer creating a mechanised automaton from human body parts. This suggests that the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology may be less supernatural than its three predecessors, which have all feature ghost/monster-type foes and themes. What we may be facing in this next game is something more in the realm of Saw, with a focus on a twisted human killer. The trailer also states that The Devil in Me is the ""season one finale"". We already knew that , but it looks as if those eight will be split into at least two seasons. What this means for the next four episodes remains unclear, but it may be that the series has a longer break between the release of The Devil in Me, presumably in 2022, and the unknown fifth game.  In our review of House of Ashes, we said that it is Supermassive's best horror game since Until Dawn, the game that cemented its reputation as a great horror developer.
