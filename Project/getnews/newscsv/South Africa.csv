Ronaldo seems pretty confident though that he can make an impact not just now but in the foreseeable future as well and is here to win titles.As reported by, in an interview with former teammate Wes Brown, Ronaldo said:“I am not here for a vacation. As I told you, before was good, winning important things and I wore the shirt before many years ago, but I am here to win again.“I am capable, me and my team-mates. I am ready to go, I am ready to go. It is a good chance for me, for the supporters, for the club, to get one step ahead.“I am ready and I think I will be a huge thing in the next three or four years.”There is not much to say that has not been said about Ronaldo as a footballer already. He is one of the best in the history of the game and has been at top for around a decade-and-a-half now. That is certainly a very impressive feat.Even at 36 years of age, he remains a brilliant goalscorer. He ended the previous season as the top scorer in Serie A and even topped the scoring charts at EURO 2020.But it is not just on the pitch that he could make a massive impact on this Manchester United team but off it as well. The young and rising players at Old Trafford can learn a lot from someone with the experience and quality of Ronaldo and it could help them take their own games to the next level.","https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_850,h_560,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Freddevilarmada.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F07%2F541071188-850x560.jpeg","Manchester United vs Newcastle LIVE: Premier League latest score, goals and updates as Ronaldo returns - MSN UK
LIVE – Updated at 16:51Follow all the action live as Manchester United host Newcastle in the Premier League this afternoon, with Cristiano Ronaldo set to make his return. After sealing his sensational return to Old Trafford, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed Ronaldo will make his second debut for the club, although the head coach refused to state whether the Portuguese would make the starting line-up. “He’s had a good week with us [training] here and he will definitely be on the pitch at some point, that’s for sure,” Solskjaer said. United took seven points from their opening three matches, thrashing Leeds before being held by Southampton and narrowly defeating Wolves. , having overcome a knock sustained while on international duty with England. , where fans have once again begun to vent their frustration at Steve Bruce, with the Magpies taking just one point from their first three matches. Joe Willock was the only major arrival in the summer window and the club seems destined for another nervous season in limbo. Here is everything you need to know:89’ - We’re about to enter stoppage-time but Newcastle have a problem.Joelinton has gone down holding his hip after slipping while trying to turn away from Paul Pogba. But the Magpies have used all their substitutes and can’t replace him. They’re down to ten temporarily.85’ - Bruno Fernandes is off too and replaced by Donny van de Beek, but not before the Old Trafford faithful gives him s standing ovation after his stunning goal.Anthony Martial is also on for Mason Greenwood, and Jeff Hendrick replaces Joe Willock for Newcastle.84’ - Steve Bruce makes his second change with Ciaran Clark replaced by Northern Ireland’s Jamal Lewis.That seems to take the Magpies into a back four shape, but it’s probably too little, too late.80’ - What a goal that is!Newcastle stand off him with the Portuguese 30-yards from goal, and he unleashes an unstoppable right-footed shot that dips and swirls on its way into the top corner.Ronaldo will understandably take all the headlines but that’s an immense piece of quality from a superb player.Woodman has no chance, and United are likely home-and-dry now.76’ - Steve Bruce sees fit to make his first change of the match, bringing on Jacob Murphy for Manquillo.Newcastle suddenly look exhausted and understandably so. They’ve defended well for the majority of the game and put an awful lot of energy into finding the equaliser.73’ - The match has lost a lot of the energy and speed which had defined the second-half in the past five minutes or so.United are controlling possession and moving more slowly in an attempt to prevent Newcastle from being able to launch the kind of counter which led to Javier Manquillo’s goal.The double-pivot of Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba has been far too easy to move through this afternoon.67’ - Matt Ritchie is working hard down the left wing and slips a ball into the penalty area for Joelinton to control.The Brazilian forward cuts inside and hits a high shot towards the roof of the net which David De Gea is equal to.Newcastle aren’t out of this game just yet.66’ - Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is making the first change of the afternoon and it’s Jadon Sancho being replaced by Jesse Lingard.The former Borussia Dortmund winger had a couple of half chances in the first-half but has been quiet for the majority of the game.63’ - It’s a very strong run and a powerful strike from Ronaldo but Woodman won’t be happy when he watches that one back.The former Swansea goalkeeper is slow to re-arrange his feet and despite clipping the ball with his level, he doesn’t react fast enough to keep the shot out.It’s nowhere near as big an error as the first, and there’s no doubt that the power on the shot from Ronaldo is brutal, but it’s definitely saveable.60’ - What a second debut this is.Newcastle aren’t level for long as Ronaldo latches onto a delicate Luke Shaw through ball, holds off the defender and drills a powerful shot through the legs of Freddie Woodman.That’s a lethal finish.58’ - Miguel Almiron jinks down the left-hand side again and slides a ball across the six-yard box which no Newcastle player gambles on and the attack comes to and end.The home side look rattled now, the crowd is nervous, and Newcastle are confident.A long way still to go, here.56’ - Well, wow! Former Liverpool defender Javier Manquillo has his first ever Newcastle goal, and what a time and place to score it!Miguel Almiron breaks superbly through the midfield, beating a slow Harry Maguire sliding tackle and bursting into the United half. Allan Saint-Maximin receives his pass and slips it to Manquillo and he charges into the penalty area, and the Spanish full-back slides a great finish into the far corner.Game on.54’ - Nemanja Matic tries his luck from all of 35-yards on his weaker left foot and the shot flies way over the bar and into the Stretford End.Manchester United are struggling to pass the ball quickly now and can’t find a way through Newcastle’s shape.50’ - Precious little in the way of action at the beginning of this second period, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s ball across the six-yard box which no United player attacked being the only moment worth noting.The crowd is fairly quiet now aside from the away end and Newcastle could potentially grow back into the game, here.Both sides are back out for the second period and neither Ole Gunnar Solskjaer nor Steve Bruce have made changes at the break.Newcastle defended quite well in the opening 45 but now need to add an extra dimension to their attack, having only really threatened in brief spells when they are able to counter-attack quickly.For the some side, creating some more clear-cut chances wouldn’t go amiss.Unlike the early kick-off at Selhurst Park, this fixture has been full of action and plenty of shooting in the opening 45 minutes.Ronaldo has taken five alone and Bruno Fernandes four, helping United to a total of 15 so far. Newcastle meanwhile have seen most of their efforts blocked but have still managed six attempts.An enjoyable game.45+3 - Well, it’s not really a surprise is it?After what in truth was a relatively poor performance from Cristiano Ronaldo for the majority of the first-half, with plenty of mis-controlled touches, the Portuguese forward scored with his first real chance of the game.In truth he couldn’t really miss after Woodman’s error. The goalkeeper will blame a slight deflection on Greenwood’s shot but that still doesn’t justify directing the ball directly into Ronaldo’s path for a simple finish.Newcastle had defended relatively well until that point and had threatened on the counter on a couple of occasions, but not they face enormous task to earn a result from a match in which they are clearly second best and facing a buoyant crowd.45+2 - Of course he does. Just as I was praising Freddie Woodman, the Newcastle goalkeeper spills a tame shot from Mason Greenwood and Ronaldo reacts fastest to tap the ball into the empty net.Old Trafford has gone berserk.43’ - It’s the Newcastle fans who are making all the noise now after a few strong periods of possession.Man United have been the better team, no doubt, but Newcastle have defended relatively well and restricted the home side to few genuine chances.Freddie Woodman in goal has played particularly well so far.38’ - Allan Saint-Maximin breaks well from a United corner and is one-on-one with Aaron Wan-Bissaka. He waits for support from team-mates and eventually plays in Sean Longstaff, but a great challenge from Harry Maguire nicks the ball away before he can pull the trigger.32’ - United break down the right through Fernandes and he passes into Sancho on the edge of the area, but the winger’s first touch is poor and takes him behind a defender, leading to a tame shaft that deflects wide for a corner.Harry Maguire sees a weak header saved by Woodman from the subsequent delivery.30’ - Fernandes again tries a shot from thirty yards and this time Jadon Sancho, who was looking for a re-bound, almost deflects it inside the far post on its path to goal but the ball drifts a yard or so wide in the end.United applying more pressure now.26’ - Bruno Fernandes attempts to beat Freddie Woodman with an audacious shot from all of fifty yards, and has the Newcastle ‘keeper scrambling, but it drops just beyond the roof of the net.23’ - A strong spell of possession in the United half for Newcastle leads to a left-footed shot from Matt Ritchie which takes a heavy deflection of Nemanja Matic and forces David De Gea to adjust his footing, before eventually making a relatively comfortable save low down to his left.20’ - Big chance for Raphael Varane as he breaks away from his marker from a corner but his glanced header towards the far post doesn’t have the right direction on it and ends up drifting a fair way wide of Woodman’s left-hand side.Best opportunity of the game so far.15’ - Allan Saint-Maximin leads a fast Newcastle counter but eventually dawdles on the ball for too long before finding Matt Ritchie, and the Scottish wing-back’s shot is closed down.A little reminder that Newcastle aren’t planning to roll over for United and Ronaldo, here.11’ - That’s much better.Ronaldo picks up the ball on the edge of the penalty area, drives alongside the left-hand side of the box with two stepovers and slams a shot towards goal which hits the side-netting at the near-post.Newcastle defenders looked terrified, there.10’ - A cross drops towards Ronaldo at the far post but the angle is tight and the Portuguese wildly swings his right-foot at the ball, dragging it wide of the near post.The Portuguese forward has struggled with his touch whenever he been involved so far.7’ - Paul Pogba lifts a lovely pass over the Newcastle defence and into the path of Bruno Fernandes who, despite timing his run well, can’t bring the ball down with his head and Freddie Woodman in the Newcastle goal is able to smother it.3’ - The only real decent piece of play so far has been an accurate through ball forward from Bruno Fernandes towards compatriot Ronaldo, but he couldn’t quite get the ball under control.A few moments earlier, Aaron Wan-Bissaka looked for the number seven with a cross which again he failed to make anything of.1’ - Newcastle get the match underway.Palace picked up three points with the win over Spurs in the early Premier League kick-off:Harry Maguire leads Manchester United out onto the pitch and the Manchester United fans are giving Cristiano Ronaldo a huge ovation, singing his name and Sir Alex Ferguson smiles down from the stands.We have just a few short minutes to wait until Manchester United and Newcastle are out on the pitch and ready for kick-off.The huge story here is, of course, Cristiano Ronald’s return and he starts up-front for the Red Devils.Here’s a quick reminder of both starting elevens:Man United: De Gea; Wan Bissaka, Varane, Maguire, Shaw; Matic, Pogba; Greenwood, Fernandes, Sancho; Ronaldo.Newcastle: Woodman; Manquillo, Hayden, Lascelles, Clark, Ritchie; Willock, Longstaff, Almiron; Joleinton, Saint-Maximin.Odsonne Édouard has also been talking to Des Kelly about his impact towards the end of the game.The Frenchman came off the bench and scored with two smart finishes to round-off slick team moves, and the home crowd went wild for their new hero.“I’m very happy for my debut. It’s a dream debut for me. I have worked very hard for this moment.Wilfried Zaha is talking to BT Sport at full-time.“That felt special”, he said. We’ve been working on trying to play good football and we showed that today. I’ve been practicing [penalties] and I’m glad to score.”On his battle with Tanganga, he added: “I’ve seen him play before. He’s strong and fast. But I enjoy battles.”After a relatively quiet opening twenty minutes, Wilfried Zaha was electric for the home side, giving new Tottenham full-back Emerson Royal a torrid time on the left-hand side.Zaha managed six dribbles, three key passes and an assist this afternoon.90+3’ - That’s it! Spurs’ 100% record comes to an end with a desperately meek performance against a Crystal Palace side who were better than them from start-to-finish this afternoon.Eric Dier’s early injury didn’t help, nor did Japhet Tanganga’s needless second-half sending off, but Palace were full value for an enormous victory in which Wilfried Zaha starred.The Ivorian opened the scoring from the penalty spot before Odsonne Édouard entered the action with ten minutes to go, scoring with two composed finishes in a spectacular cameo.90+2’ - What a debut and what a finish this is.Édouard finishes off a slick move which began with a raking cross-field ball from Milivojevic, before Gallagher’s cut-back to Édouard who shifts the ball past Emerson Royal before lashing it into the top corner.Marvellous afternoon for the Eagles.86’ - Jordan Ayew is replaced by 19-year-old wide player Michael Olise who was signed from Reading this summer.Hard to imagine him impressing more than Édouard here, but with Spurs in disarray, who knows?84’ - Wow. Zaha breaks down the left-hand side once again, cuts it back towards the penalty spot for Édouard, and after two touches to control and set himself, the Frenchman drags a shot towards the far post that wriggles just beyond Hugo Lloris’ out-stretched hand and finds the corner of the net.Selhurst Park erupts and Édouard is delighted. Palace are full value for a two-goal lead.83’ - Summer signing Odsonne Édouard is on to replace Christian Benteke who, despite not having a clear chance at goal this afternoon, has occupied Spurs defenders and given his team-mates space to work in on plenty of occasions.81’ - Lucas Moura loses a boot after slipping before giving a yellow card for throwing the ball away in frustration.The majority of his anger will be with his team-mates who have offered zero support for the Spurs attack all afternoon.Confirmed line-ups - Cristiano Ronaldo is straight into the United XI!Sancho and Varane also start, while Newcastle’s big-money signing Joe Willock is in for them too.Man United: De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Maguire, Varane, Shaw; Pogba, Matic; Greenwood, Fernandes, Sancho; Ronaldo.Newcastle: Woodman; Manquillo, Lascelles, Clark, Ritchie; Hayden, S Longstaff, Willock; Almiron, Saint-Maximin, Joelinton78’ - Spurs hadn’t conceded a goal so far this season until Zaha calmly slipped the penalty to the right of Lloris, but now with ten men and precious little threat in attack all afternoon it’s extremely difficult to see them finding a way back into the match.The home crowd are delighted and singing Zaha’s name in full voice.75’ - Hugo Lloris goes the wrong way and Wilfried Zaha scores his first of the season to give Palace a full-merited lead here.Great composure from the Ivorian, who has caused the visitors so many problems all afternoon.74’ - Ben Davies’ arm is out-stretched as he blocks a Conor Gallagher cross and that is a definite penalty.VAR confirms.74’ - Tyrick Mitchell lifts a cross towards the far post which beats Hugo Lloris and looks to be dropping into the net unaided before Sergio Reguilon somehow manages to position himself in a way which allows him to head it wide for a corner-kick.72’ - Patrick Vieira’s 11 men are enjoying pretty much all of the possession now but Spurs seem to have settled into a resolute shape fairly well, with Joe Rodon in particular impressing ever since he replaced Eric Dier early in the first-half.Nuno Espirito Santo will be pleased if they can continue defending like this for the final twenty minutes or so.66’ - Luka Milivoijevic is on for the home side as a replacement for Chiekhou Kouyaté, who has put a good shift in at the centre of the park.65’ - Zaha has had the beating of Emerson Royal all afternoon and manages it once again, clipping a cross towards the unmarked Jordan Ayew at the far post.The ball takes an age to settle and by the time the Ghanaian can strike it Dele Alli has steamed into his path to make a superb block.58’ - Ben Davies is replacing Harry Winks to create an all -Welsh centre-half pairing for Spurs alongside Joe Rodon.They’re now playing a 4-4-1 formation of sorts with only one substitution remaining.57’ - Japhet Tanganga has been sent off by Jon Moss for a second bookable offence after flying into a late challenge on Jordan Ayew.The incident with Zaha and the atmosphere seems to have got to the young defender’s head and he’s paying the price now.52’ - Japhet Tanganga clears out Wilfried Zaha with a ruthless foul by shoving him to the ground as the Eagles counter and the Ivorian takes exception to the challenge, pushing and shoving the Spurs defender before players from both sides get themselves involved.Both players are booked and Palace have a free-kick in a good area, but Conor Gallagher clips it out for a goal-kick.50’ - Crystal Palace fans are shouting for a penalty as Conor Gallagher’s volley from ten yards out is blocked by Joe Rodon but the Welshman’s hand was nowhere near the ball when it made contact.This second-half has already had so much more action than the entirety of the first.48’ - Spurs have already looked brighter in this half and gave played two nice through ball into the full-backs along the edge of the penalty area, which is more than they managed at any point before the break.They managed their first shot of the match so far at the end of that passage of play, with Vicente Guaita saving comfortably from Lucas Moura.Crystal Palace are first to return to the turf for the second-half and look raring to go, here.Neither side has made a change at the break but Tottenham certainly need to come out with a refreshed attitude if they’re going to win this game.Spurs’ three midfield players - Skipp, Hojbjerg, and Winks - all have solid pass completion rates in that first-half but the lack of ambition in the passing range is costing them so far.There were plenty of occasions in that opening period where the chance to spray the ball quickly wide to the full-backs was on, but on every single occasion they chose to cut back inside and play something simple.Nuno will need to encourage to be more adventurous in the second period if Spurs are to create anything significant, here.Half-time - It’s all level at the break after a goalless first-half but Patrick Vieira will be far more pleased with his side’s performance so far than Nuno Espirito Santo.After foul-ridden opening half-an-hour the Eagles stepped things up with Wilfried Zaha and Conor Gallagher increasingly influential, and the on-loan Chelsea man missed the only real chance of the opening period from the Ivorian’s cut-back as Hugo Lloris reacted quickly in the Spurs goal to block the 21-year-old’s shot.Palace ended the half with seven shots at goal while Spurs have yet to fashion a single attempt, with Harry Kane totally anonymous and isolated in attack.42’ - By far the biggest chance of the match so far falls to Conor Gallagher just four or five yards from goal but Spurs ‘keeper Huge Loris smothers him quickly and deflects the ball wide for a corner off his shin.The increasingly lively Wilfried Zaha beat Emerson Royal on the wing before cutting the ball back into the area.Palace have begun creating chances in the past ten minutes or so and the visitors look like they need half-time to get a grip of themselves.40’ - Tottenham’s attacking players have barely had a kick in this half, with Harry Kane in particular looking isolated and unable to affect the game.An intriguing stat though is that Lucas Moura has made four tackles so far, more than anybody else out there.35’ - Palace swing in two corners in quick succession and Huge Lloris has to punch them clear under a lot of pressure inside the six-yard box.The France ‘skipper dealt with the threat well, there.33’ - Crystal Palace are starting to control more of the ball in the final third but none of their forwards appear to be on the same wavelength, with a promising attack ending with Wilfried Zaha booming a ball towards the far post and out of play while Christian Benteke moved towards the near side.Moments later Zaha shifts the ball past Oliver Skipp and wins a corner via small deflection.26’ - Both sides have passing accuracy percentages in the low 80s at the moment and plenty of passes are being slightly overhit or mis-placed, which is leading to an array of small fouls in the middle third of the pitch and preventing any kind of rhythm from building up.Really lacking in quality so far.21’ - Dele Alli makes a clumsy challenge and Crystal Palace have a free-kick in a decent position, but Conor Gallagher gets the shape on the ball all wrong and sends it high over the bar.Still, we’ve had our first shot of the match, at least.18’ - There have been zero shots at goal and a total of nine fouls in this match so far, which tells you everything you need to know about how it’s going.13’ - Neither side has worked a real opportunity so far with plenty of good work being done in midfield before play breaks down around the edge of the box.Lucas Moura has had the ball nipped away from his feet while looking to cause problems on a couple of occasions.10’ - Eric Dier is down again and Joe Rodon is being readied on the bench.The Welshman will be coming on to partner Japhet Tanganga at the back.There was no malice in the challenge from Jordan Ayew but the speed at which the two players made contact is what has caused the problem.7’ - Eric Dier is sold short by an unexpected throw out from Hugo Lloris and Jordan Ayew steams in to try and win the ball, clearing out the Spurs centre-back in the process.Dier is back on his feet but moving awkwardly and with Cristian Romero and Davinson Sanchez both missing this afternoon, Spurs could face a significant problem if that is a real injury.4’ - Emerson Royal is already in the thick of the action, fouling Wilfried Zaha as the Ivorian looked to make his way towards the penalty area.That could be a fascinating battle throughout the afternoon.1’ - We’re underway in south London with Crystal Palace in red-and-blue stripes and Spurs in white.A minute’s silence is currently taking place at Selhurst Park to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.All other Premier League fixtures this afternoon will involve the same process.A quick reminder before kick-off of the two starting elevens thus afternoon:Crystal Palace: Guaita; Ward, Andersen, Guehi, Mitchell; Gallagher, Kouyate, McArthur; Ayew, Benteke, Zaha.Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris; Royal, Tanganga, Dier, Reguilon; Winks, Skipp, Hojbjerg; Alli, Kane, Moura.Patrick Vieira is looking for his first Crystal Pace win in front of the home crowd at Selhurst Park and they’re making themselves heard already as the players make their way onto the pitch.We’ve had full crowds back for a good few weeks now but it’s still glorious hearing the roars and seeing the joy on people’s faces in stadiums around the country.Palace boss Patrick Vieira has stuck with the same line-up as their previous outing away at West Ham, despite bringing in Odsonne Édouard and Michael Olise at the end of the transfer window, and has been explaining his reasoning to BT Sport:“I was really pleased with the performances [against West Ham] so there wasn’t any reason for me to change it. The players on the bench are ready to come on and help the team.On the threat posed by today’s visitors, Vieira added: “[Harry] Kane is one of the best forwards in the league and in Europe. But Tottenham is all about the squad, he is scoring goals because the team is playing well.Nuno Espirito Santo has been talking to BT Sport about the impact of the issues created by the quarantine period his Argentinian players Cristian Romero and Giovanni Lo Celso are having to undergo post-international break.“The most difficult is the the opponent”, said Espirito Santo. “And then all the issues we have which everyone is aware of. They [Argentinians] are training in Croatia and will arrive the day before we play Chelsea.On Emerson Royal’s start, he added: “Due to the circumstances we have to use all the squad. W. think he has the quality to help the team. He is an offensive full-back with experience.”Spurs have yet to concede a goal so far this season, of course, winning all three of their previous matches by a single goal to take nine points from nine under their new boss. That’s three wins and three clean sheets to start the season for the first time in the club’s history.Espirito Santo built his Wolves side in a similarly resolute mould and the blueprint is working in his new role so far, but it’s a slightly makeshift back-line for the Lilywhites today with Japhet Tanganga moving into centre-half from the right-back slot and late summer signing Emerson Royal earning a first start in his place.Matt Doherty has been dropped from the team to make way for the former Barcelona man and it will be fascinating to see whether the the bedding-in period goes smoothly or not.Dele Alli’s Tottenham career stalled after the arrival of Jose Mourinho, but the 25-year-old has played the full 90 minutes all three of his side’s Premier League fixtures since Nuno Espirito Santo took charge this summer.The former MK Dons midfielder scored the winner from the penalty spot against Wolves at Molineux a few weeks back and will no doubt have his sights set on a return to the England squad with more World Cup qualifiers coming up in October and November.Son Heung-Min misses out for Spurs due to an injury suffered on international duty, meaning Alli is set to start on the left of the front-three at Selhurst Park.Palace have only scored twice in three Premier League matches so far this season, with both coming courtesy of on-loan Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher in the 2-2 draw with West Ham United.Christian Benteke starts today and managed to score 10 last season, with summer signing Odsonne Édouard on the bench after being brought in on transfer deadline day, meaning today’s frontline doesn’t possess tons of goal threat from the off.Patrick Vieira could well require more goals from midfield like those Gallagher notched against the Hammers if his side are to have a successful afternoon.Emerson Royal goes straight into Tottenham’s starting XI while Oliver Skipp starts too after doubts over his fitness. Son Heung-min is confirmed as being unavailable due to a calf injury and is not included in the squad.🤩 Your team to face @CPFC! 👇 New signings Odsonne Edouard and Michael Olise are both on the bench for Crystal Palace, with Patrick Vieira naming an unchanged starting XI from the club’s 2-2 draw with West Ham. COME ON YOU PALACE#CPFC | #CRYTOTWelcome to The Independent’s live coverage as Crystal Palace host Tottenham in the Premier League’s early kick-off this afternoon, with Nuno Espirito Santo’s side aiming to extend their perfect record this season.

MONZA - Valtteri Bottas claimed pole position for the Italian Grand Prix Sprint after snatching top spot in qualifying from his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton.Finn Bottas clocked one minute, 19.555 seconds on his last qualifying lap to finish just 0.096 sec ahead of seven-time world champion Hamilton, who had been fastest in the first two qualifying sessions and practice and had been leading Q3 until he was pipped in the final seconds.That means 32-year-old Bottas will lead the field in Saturday's 100km Sprint, which will decide the grid for the GP on Sunday and give championship points to the top three.First place in the Sprint will take three points, second place two and third place one.However, Bottas will start at the back of the grid on Sunday regardless of how he fares in the Sprint as he was penalised for taking on power unit components.Red Bull's championship leader Max Verstappen took third as he tries to defend his tiny three-point lead from Hamilton, who on Sunday will again attempt to bring up a century of GP wins.Hamilton has been stuck on 99 wins since taking the British GP at Silverstone in mid-July.Charles Leclerc asked the Ferrari fans at Monza to create the same fervour as that which accompanied Verstappen's win at the Dutch GP last week.And the Monegasque finished eighth, 0.955sec off Bottas and a place behind his teammate Carlos Sainz.Download the Eyewitness News app to your iOS  or Android  device.

It resumed flying in December 2020, while in business rescue.It stopped all flights again, however, on Monday July 5 due to the longer curfews imposed in response to the adjusted level 4 lockdown, which prohibited nonessential travel in and out of Gauteng,  and caused low demand for air travel. The suspension of services left it without the sufficient capital needed to resume travel, putting its business rescue plan under threat.Kulula flights resumed on September 1.It announced the transaction publicly on Friday. The company's creditors, however, were alerted of the deal at the end of August and are required to vote to approve the sale on September 21. In a notice to creditors on its website, Comair said it needed the deal to access funding: “following the pursuit of certain funding initiatives to ensure that the company had sufficient funding to recommence its flight operations on September 1, it has disposed of its slow lounge business failing which, given the severity of the level four lockdown conditions, the company would likely not have emerged from business rescue”.The deal also includes a R250m loan from FirstRand Bank. Richard Ferguson, one of Comair’s business rescue practitioners, said in a statement the funding from the deal was a significant step towards the successful conclusion of the business rescue process.“There is still work to be done, but these capital inflows, the fact that Comair is back in the skies and again earning revenue, coupled with the commitment by the investors to support the viability and sustainability of the business, all point to a positive outcome,” Ferguson said.Comair has also received R20m from SAA’s business rescue practitioners as part of the R1.1bn settlement of a high court damages award for anticompetitive behaviour. SAA paid an initial amount of R289m in February 2019, but the balance is payable in instalments until July 2022. However, SAA has been in business rescue, delaying its payments to Comair.The business rescue plan has former Comair board members and executives investing fresh equity of R500m in return for a 99% shareholding.Discovery Vitality also invested R100m as part of its Vitality reward programme linked to the airline. Comair delisted from the JSE in April, with jobs cut to 1,800 from 2,200  through voluntary retrenchment and early retirement.Correction: September 10 2021An earlier version of this story said Comair was due to delist from the JSE when it had, in fact, already done so in April 2021.childk@businesslive.co.zaWould you like to comment on this article or view other readers' comments?

And right now plants — yes, plants — are taking up more of his time.Hochman runs a division of Yum! Brands with 4,000 stores that has faced multiple hurdles over the past year. There’s the continued strength of rival Popeyes, poultry shortages and the disruption caused by Covid-19. However, the chain has largely come through the pandemic unscathed — maybe even stronger as same-store sales jumped 11% last quarter.But the boom in faux meat, especially among young Americans, offers another challenge and opportunity, and Hochman is preparing KFC for what looks like an inevitable future of fake chicken going mainstream. The chain has tested a plant-based nugget from Beyond Meat, but so far hasn’t taken it nationwide. And its ambitions are now bigger than that, pushing to bring a faux option that replicates a piece of fried chicken.Bloomberg recently spoke to Hochman about fake meat, expanding deeper into cities and if having dining rooms at KFC locations still makes sense.Faux chicken hasn’t taken off like plant-based beef yet. What’s really going to drive people to embrace it?The taste is always going to be number one. There were plant-based burgers that were out there well before Beyond and Impossible. The taste wasn’t as good. Let’s just be candid about it. The majority of customers aren’t willing to sacrifice that.What we’re trying to replicate is a tenderloin where you actually have the muscle fibres. The texture is a bit more pleasing than what we’d call a chewed-and-glued. It’s a different technology.Our plan is to try to replicate that Kentucky Fried Chicken as close as we can, obviously without using the animal. A lot of that is about how the chicken cuts and tears and the mouth feel. The gold standard is the chicken tenderloin or chicken strip.So is that gold standard hitting my local KFC in the near future?I’d like to talk to you soon about that.One big debate is what’s the long-term demand for plant-based meat? The predictions vary wildly, with one report from Kearny saying that traditional meat will make up just 55% of the global meat market in 2035.A lot of people think plant-based is about vegan or vegetarian. Over 90% of people who buy Beyond in the grocery store are also eating animal proteins. I eat plant-based hamburgers at home now because I think they’re as good as the regular burger.Younger people tend to be the ones that want to eat more plant-based. We envision this trend to continue to grow. We’re pretty bullish on that. We don’t think that plant-based is a fad, we think that’s something that’s going to continue to grow over time.Do you envision a future where fake chicken dominates the market?I don’t think it will ever be the majority of the market. I think it will one day be a sizeable segment of the fried-chicken market, but it’s never going to replace animal protein.On your expansion strategy, KFC is actually planning to open stores in major cities, like New York. I thought the pandemic told us the suburbs were hot, and cities were dead?It’s more about targeting places where lots of people live because they have to eat somewhere. The markets that we should have opening this year are New York. So Queens, or like a Harlem, where there’s a lot of people living.What’s the future of dining in after the pandemic pushed more takeout and delivery?Pre-pandemic KFC was 14% dine in. Currently it’s about 2%. We don’t anticipate it getting back to 14%.The KFC prototypes we’re working on typically have smaller dining rooms than a traditional KFC. We’ll reinvest that space into quick pick-up areas for customers. You can run in and grab your food in a cubby space without ever having to talk to a team member. We’re going to be making investments in every KFC in the country that will have this cubby system.Bloomberg News.

"Failure to vaccinate may turn Africa into fertile ground for new Covid-19 variants, scientists warn - HeraldLIVE
Africa must not be left behind in the global response to Covid-19 and vaccination rollouts, lest the continent becomes a breeding ground for new variants.This is the stern warning from African scientists and public health specialists, who have been conducting genomic surveillance on the continent since the arrival of the coronavirus early in 2020.The scientists from various universities in SA, who have been working closely with the Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC) said that even though the continent has played a crucial role in analysis of different variants that have been doing the rounds in the world, guiding the global public health response, Africa has been lagging behind in its response compared to other parts of the world.This is due to its fragile health and scientific infrastructure, lack of technology, weak purchasing power, “and the fact that diagnostics and reagents were being hoarded by developed countries”, making Africa the world’s least vaccinated continent.In a paper published in the journal Science on Friday, scientists from various institutions including the University of KwaZulu-Natal and Stellenbosch University, the Covid-19 experts said: “Africa must not be left behind in the global pandemic response, otherwise it could become a breeding ground for new Covid-19 variants.”Prof Tulio de Oliveira, a professor of bioinformatics and director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP) at UKZN said: “We are deeply committed to using the most advanced technologies in Africa to trace and combat the virus. If the virus keeps evolving on the African continent, this will become a global problem. It is our moral duty to try to protect Africa and the world.”De Oliveira, who is also involved with Stellenbosch University's school for data science and computational thinking, said that doing the analysis of Covid-19 variants in 33 African countries was “very fulfilling”.The collaboration included 112 African and 25 international organisations, including Africa CDC and the World Health Organisation (WHO). It shows that the epidemics in most countries were initiated by importations predominantly from Europe, which diminished after the early introduction of international travel restrictions.As the pandemic progressed, ongoing transmission in many countries and increasing mobility led to the emergence and continentwide spread of many variants of concern and interest, such as Beta that was first identified in SA, and Eta that was initially identified in the UK and Nigeria.In spite of limited sampling, the African scientists identified many of the variants of concern and interest that are being transmitted across the world. In the paper they caution that if the pandemic is not controlled in Africa, “we may see the production of vaccine-escape variants, which may profoundly affect the African and global population”.De Oliveira said: “This was a very fulfilling collaboration. Not only did we manage to share and analyse our African data together, the collaboration also involved complete sharing of knowledge, with all analysis scripts shared and hundreds of hours of capacity building in analysis and data generation so that genomics can be decentralised and performed in real time in Africa.”Dr John Nkengasong, director of the Africa CDC, said strengthening genomic surveillance systems across the continent is key for early detection and control of disease outbreaks.“Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Africa CDC Institute of Pathogen Genomics has been supporting member states to expand their SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance for the rapid detection of variants. The Institute is very proud of this collaborative work and will continue to co-ordinate collaboration among public health, academic and research institutions to strengthen pathogen genomics and bioinformatics capacity in Africa.”Since this collaboration, Africa has increased its genomics surveillance and today there are about 40,000 African genomes available.Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said that without genomic surveillance, variants can spread undetected on the continent and across the globe.“This will prolong the acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic, not just in Africa, but worldwide.“We ignore mutations and variants at our own peril. The Delta variant is a wake-up call and underlines the importance of genomic information, and of ensuring that African scientists have the necessary resources to analyse the evolution of Covid-19,” the authors noted.TimesLIVE",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"The Latest: Senators want nursing home vaccine rates posted - Bismarck Tribune

Mike Dunleavy said President Joe Biden’s effort to require millions of U.S. workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is “ill conceived, divisive, and un-American.”“At a time in which we are called to work together, forced medical procedures run counter to our collective sense of fairness and liberty,” the Republican said in a statement. “My administration is aggressively identifying every tool at our disposal to protect the inherent individual rights of all Alaskans.”The statement did not describe what that might entail.Dunleavy has butted heads with the Biden administration on resource development issues. Dunleavy has faced some criticism in Alaska for not mandating masks or for not implementing a new disaster declaration to deal with a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. He has instead asked lawmakers to act on legislation aimed at addressing staffing concerns raised by health care facilities.In his statement Friday, Dunleavy said that it is “clear from the data and empirical evidence over the last year that the vaccine is the most effective way to fight COVID-19. From what we are seeing in our hospitals, the very ill are mostly those who are unvaccinated.”“As Governor, and as someone who had COVID and has been vaccinated, I will continue to recommend that Alaskans speak to their healthcare providers and discuss the merits of the vaccine based on their individual healthcare needs,” he said.———MORE ON THE PANDEMIC:— Virus claims Black morticians, leaving holes in communities— Biden presses states to require vaccines for all teachers— Court: DeSantis ban on school mask mandates back in force— South Africa vaccinates some kids in test of Chinese vaccine— Key parts of Biden’s plan to confront delta variant surge———— See AP coverage at ———HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:JACKSON, Miss. - Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that President Joe Biden’s new federal vaccine requirements are “clearly unconstitutional” and that he believes Biden issued the mandate to distract Americans from the fallout over his decision to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan.“This is the same bait and switch,” Reeves said at a press conference outside the Governor’s Mansion in Jackson. Biden “wants us to talk about anything but Afghanistan, and sadly, he’s willing to trample on the rights of 100 million Americans to try to help himself politically. That, to me, is disgusting.”Reeves said a member of the executive branch of government does not have the authority to mandate workers be vaccinated. “It’s clearly unconstitutional for the president, to unilaterally with one signature, decide something of this magnitude,” he said.“In essence, what the president saying is... hard-working Americans — many of whom work here and live here in Mississippi — hard-working Mississippians have to choose between either injecting themselves with something and potentially having the ability to earn a living to produce food for their family,” he said. “That’s a ridiculous choice.”———HELENA, Mt. -- Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has promised to fight the new federal vaccine mandate in court.The Republican said on Friday that once the full guidelines for the mandate are released, he will file a lawsuit to strike it down.President Joe Biden announced Thursday the vaccine mandate that could affect as many as 100 million Americans, including all workers in businesses with 100 or more employees.The new mandate appears to conflict with a Montana law passed earlier this year that makes it illegal for private employers to mandate vaccines as a condition for employment. But University of Montana law professor Anthony Johnston says federal law will take precedence over state law if there is a direct conflict.———DETROIT — A major health care provider in southeastern Michigan says 92% of its employees have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by a Friday deadline and another 3% have gotten a first shot.Under Henry Ford Health System’s policy, employees will be suspended if they don’t get at least one dose by midnight or schedule an appointment. They will lose their jobs if they’re not fully vaccinated by Oct. 1. There are some exceptions.Henry Ford Health says in a statement: “We remain confident that vaccination, along with masking, remains the most powerful tool we have against the pandemic.”Separately, a lawsuit challenging the vaccine policy was suddenly dropped Friday ahead of a hearing in federal court.The Detroit-based health system employs more than 30,000 workers and has five acute care hospitals, four in the Detroit area and one in Jackson. It has treated thousands of COVID-19 patients.———MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama’s chief health officer says a surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations appears to have stabilized but the state still faces a “real crisis” of an overwhelming number of patients needing intensive care, nearly all of whom aren’t vaccinated.Dr. Scott Harris, head of the Alabama Department of Public Health reports that after threatening to reach an all-time high for coronavirus hospitalizations, state hospitals have seen a slight decline in recent days.He says he’s thankful that there has been “a little bit of a plateau over the last week. ... The numbers aren’t great. But the numbers at least have not continued to go up,” he said.Still, Harris says, demand for intensive care beds is exceeding the state’s capacity. Patients who normally would be treated in ICU wards are instead in emergency rooms, normal beds or even gurneys left in hallways.———HONOLULU — Hawaii Gov. David Ige is requiring government contractors and visitors to state facilities to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test.State contractors must attest to their employees’ vaccination status or provide weekly tests for unvaccinated staff. Contractors also must wear masks and maintain physical distance while on state property.The order also applies to visitors to state facilities, but not to beaches or outdoor state properties. Inmates at correctional facilities, patients at state hospitals and children under 12 or students attending state public or charter schools are exempt, as are travelers arriving at airports.The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports that Ige’s executive order takes effect Monday.Hawaii has had a recent record surge of new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths.———ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — The on-again, off-again ban imposed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to prevent mandated masks for Florida school students is back in force.The 1st District Court of Appeal ruled Friday that a Tallahassee judge shouldn’t have lifted an automatic stay two days ago that halted enforcement of the mask mandate ban. The upshot is the state can resume its efforts to impose financial penalties on the 13 Florida school boards currently defying the mask ban.The U.S. Department of Education has begun a grant program for school districts that lose money for implementing mandatory masks and other coronavirus safety measures.DeSantis has argued the new Parents Bill of Rights law gives parents the authority to determine whether their children should wear a mask to school. School districts with mandatory mask rules allow an opt-out only for medical reasons, not parental discretion.Charles Gallagher, attorney for parents challenging the DeSantis ban, says in a tweet, “students, parents and teachers are back in harm’s way.”———SALT LAKE CITY — Thirteen Utah hospitals will postpone many non-emergency surgeries starting next week, citing health care workers overwhelmed by surging coronavirus cases.Intermountain Healthcare announced Friday that the hospitals will postpone non-urgent procedures for several weeks starting Sept. 15. The announcement comes a week after state hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to stem a virus surge fueled by the delta variant.There were 516 people hospitalized for COVID-19 and ICUs were 93% full in Utah on Thursday, according to state data. That’s nearing its previous peak in December when ICUs were 104% full and 606 people were hospitalized.About 62% of Utah residents age 12 and older have been fully vaccinated. Utah reported 10 deaths on Thursday, bringing the confirmed total to 2,703.———JACKSON, Miss. — Doctors who spread misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine could have their license to practice medicine suspended or revoked, according to a new policy adopted by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure.The policy says doctors have an “ethical and professional responsibility” to practice medicine in the best interest of their patients and share factual and scientifically grounded information with them.“Spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,” it reads.Mississippi ranks among the lowest in the country with just 38% of its 3 million residents fully vaccinated. The department of health reported 1,892 confirmed cases and 35 deaths on Friday.Mississippi has registered at least 460,000 cases and 8,905 confirmed deaths.———WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is calling some Republican governors “cavalier” for resisting new federal vaccine requirements he hopes will contain the surging delta variant.Biden visited Brookland Middle School on Friday, just a short drive from the White House. He was making the case for new federal rules that could impact 100 million Americans.All employers with more than 100 workers must be vaccinated or tested weekly for the virus, affecting about 80 million Americans. About 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also must be fully vaccinated.“I am so disappointed that particularly some Republican governors have been so cavalier with the health of these kids, so cavalier with the health of their communities,” Biden said during the visit. “This isn’t a game”Republicans and some union officials say he’s overreaching his authority. Asked about potential legal challenges to the new vaccine requirements, Biden responded, “Have at it.”———ATLANTA — Protests from faculty members continue at Georgia’s public universities, although leaders of the state's university system are not backing down from their position that schools can’t require masks or vaccines.Acting Chancellor Teresa MacCartney says those policies aren’t going to change, noting the system will follow the lead of Gov. Brian Kemp and Republican lawmakers who control the university system’s purse strings.“We are fulfilling our institutional missions to deliver higher education and services for students in a way that is best for them,” MacCartney said. “Those expectations have been made clear since before the semester started. It should be no surprise. There are consequences for those not following through and doing their jobs.”The remarks earned a round applause from regents, who were mostly unmasked. They were surrounded by dozens of university presidents and administrators, who were mostly masked.MacCartney spoke Thursday, the same day faculty groups at the University of Georgia, Georgia Tech and Georgia State University passed resolutions calling for mask and vaccine mandates.———WASHINGTON — Senior Democratic senators are pressing Medicare to make information on nursing home COVID-19 vaccination rates easily accessible for consumers.Although the Biden administration is requiring vaccination for all nursing home staff, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania say it could take months. They’re asking Medicare to post vaccination rates among residents and staff of individual facilities on its Care Compare website.“These data reside on entirely separate (government) websites,” the senators wrote Medicare head Chiquita Brooks-LaSure on Friday. “Even if a person could find these websites, the vaccination data for individual facilities are not prominently displayed, creating additional barriers.”Medicare officials say they’re working on the problem.The senators cited an Associated Press report on outbreaks attributed to unvaccinated staff. Wyden and Casey chair the Finance and Aging committees, respectively.———PARIS — France has announced new restrictions for U.S. travelers who are not vaccinated against the coronavirus.Starting Sunday, unvaccinated travelers from the U.S. who previously could enter with only a recent negative test must now show “pressing grounds for travel.”These grounds also apply broadly to returning French citizens, legal residents, relatives of French citizens, foreign health professionals coming to assist in the fight against COVID-19, transportation and diplomatic workers, and people transiting through the country.The restrictions do not apply to fully vaccinated travelers from the U.S.The decision follows the European Union’s recommendation last week that its 27 nations reinstate restrictions on U.S. tourists because of rising coronavirus infections there.———JOHANNESBURG — South Africa has started vaccinating children and adolescents as part of the global Phase 3 clinical trials of China’s Sinovac Biotech shot for children 6 months to 17 years.The global study will enroll 2,000 participants in South Africa and 12,000 others in Kenya, the Philippines, Chile and Malaysia. The first children in South Africa were inoculated at the Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University in the capital Pretoria to kick off the trials.The Sinovac company says others will get shots at six different sites across the country.South Africa has recorded 6,270 infections and 175 confirmed deaths in the last 24 hours. The 2.8 million total infections account for more than 35% of cases in Africa. The nation has 84,327 confirmed deaths.———COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Denmark’s high vaccination rate has enabled the Scandinavian country to become one of the first European Union nations to lift all domestic restrictions.The return to normality has been gradual, but as of Friday, the digital pass — a proof of having been vaccinated — is no longer required when entering nightclubs, the last virus safeguard to fall.More than 80% of people above age 12 have had the two shots. As of midnight, the Danish government no longer considers COVID-19 “a socially critical disease.”Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said last month that “the epidemic is under control” but warned: “we are not out of the epidemic” and the government will act as needed if necessary.———BERLIN — Germany’s standing committee on vaccination is recommending that pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19.The committee said Friday that after evaluating the available evidence, it is issuing a draft recommendation that women from the second trimester of pregnancy onward and breastfeeding mothers get two doses of an mRNA vaccine.It also recommended that all those of child-bearing age who haven’t yet been vaccinated get inoculated so they are protected from the coronavirus before any pregnancy.About two-thirds of Germany’s population has received at least one vaccine dose and 61.9% have been fully vaccinated. The pace of vaccinations has slowed to a crawl recently, and officials are keen to encourage more people to get the shots before the winter.———LONDON — A leading scientist behind the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine says booster shots may be unnecessary for many people.Oxford University Professor Sarah Gilbert tells The Telegraph newspaper that immunity from the vaccine is holding up well, even against the delta variant.She says that while older adults and those who are immune-compromised may need boosters, the standard two-dose regimen should protect most people.Gilbert says the world’s priority should be to get more vaccines to countries with limited supplies.Copyright 2021 The Associated Press.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) - After 548 days with restrictions to limit the spread of COVID-19, Denmark's high vaccination rate has enabled the Scandinavian country to become one of the first European Union nations to lift all domestic restrictions. The return to normality has been gradual, but as of Friday, the digital pass - a proof of having been vaccinated - is no longer required when entering night clubs, making it the last virus safeguard to fall.More than 80% of people above the age of 12 have had the two shots. ""I wouldn't say it is too early. We have opened the door but we have also said that we can close it if needed,"" Soeren Riis Paludan, a professor of virology with the Aarhus University in Denmark's second largest city, told The Associated Press.As of midnight, the Danish government no longer considers COVID-19 ""a socially critical disease."" Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said Aug. 27 that ""the epidemic is under control"" but warned: ""we are not out of the epidemic"" and the government will act as needed if necessary.Jens Lundgren, a professor of viral diseases at the Copenhagen University Hospital said the government would be ""quite willing"" to reintroduce restrictions if infections spike again. He pointed at night clubs being the last thing to open because ""it is the activity associated with the highest risk of transmission.""""The world is in the middle of a pandemic and none of us can claim that we are beyond the pandemic,"" said Lundgren who described Denmark as being ""an isolated island"" where the vaccine rollout has worked.""Nobody should have the illusion that we are over this.""The tipping point in Denmark to start easing restrictions came when a majority in the age group of 50+ had the two shots, Riis Paludan said.Since Aug. 14, a face mask on public transportation is no longer mandatory. On Sept. 1, night clubs reopened, limits on public gatherings were removed and it was no longer mandatory to show the pass when one wanted to be seated inside restaurants, or go to soccer games, fitness centers or hairdresser. However, the face mask or shield are still mandatory at airports and people are advised to wear one when at the doctor's, test centers or hospitals. Distancing is still recommended and strict entry restrictions still apply for non Danes at the borders. The outbreak is still considered ""an ordinary dangerous illness.""""The ghost of corona sits in the back of our head,"" said Frank Oestergaard, a patron in a downtown Copenhagen restaurant.After more than a year, several European countries are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but with caveats. Some have lifted restrictions but will introduce a vaccination passport. Others expect to do so soon. And in some places, there are few restrictions and they are not respected.On July 19, the British government lifted remaining legal restrictions for England, though it still plans to introduce a vaccination passport for entry into nightclubs and other crowded venues at the end of September.In Denmark's neighbor Sweden, which has stood out among European nations for its comparatively hands-off response to the pandemic, the government said earlier this month that most restrictions, including the ceiling for private and public gatherings and the advice to work from home, will be removed as of Sept. 29.The Scandinavian country has not gone into lockdowns or closed businesses, relying instead on citizens' sense of civic duty to control infection. According to official figures, 70% of people over the age of 15 have gotten both shots and nearly 82 % have received the first shot.And despite a surge, most of the Balkan countries practically have no restrictions, and those which are in place are not respected.In late May, the Danish government presented the passport app featuring a QR code and a green bar if the person has been vaccinated twice or recently tested negative. A paper version also was available. People either had to scan the code or flash it before entering an airport, a harbor, a train station, a hairdresser or an eatery. While in many European countries there were pockets of resistance such passes, people used it all the time in Denmark because people trust authorities, Riis Paludan said. Armed with their pass, people were able to get a haircut, have a drink with friends or attend a cultural event. ""It was getting one's freedom back instead of having to sit at home in isolation,"" laughed Oestergaard. ""I think it's very good, so hopefully we can get back to a normal day in the restaurant business without checking people and just no restrictions whatsoever. That's nice,"" said cafe owner Ralph Marker.___Follow AP's pandemic coverage at:

New U.S. studies released Friday show the COVID-19 vaccines remain highly effective against hospitalizations and death even as the extra-contagious delta variant swept the country.One study tracked over 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July. As delta surged in early summer, those who were unvaccinated were 4.5 times more likely than the fully vaccinated to get infected, over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Vaccination works,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC’s director, told a White House briefing Friday. “The bottom line is this: We have the scientific tools we need to turn the corner on this pandemic.”But as earlier data has shown, protection against coronavirus infection is slipping some: It was 91% in the spring but 78% in June and July, the study found. So-called ""breakthrough” cases in the fully vaccinated accounted for 14% of hospitalizations and 16% of deaths in June and July, about twice the percentage as earlier in the year. An increase in those percentages isn’t surprising: No one ever said the vaccines were perfect and health experts have warned that as more Americans get vaccinated, they naturally will account for a greater fraction of the cases.Walensky said Friday that well over 90% of people in U.S. hospitals with COVID-19 are unvaccinated.CDC released two other studies Friday that signaled hints of waning protection for older adults. One examined COVID-19 hospitalizations in nine states over the summer and found protection for those 75 and older was 76% compared to 89% for all other adults. And in five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations was 95% among 18- to 64-year-olds compared to 80% among those 65 and older. It isn't clear if the changes seen over time are because immunity is waning in people first vaccinated many months ago, that the vaccine isn’t quite as strong against delta -- or that much of the country abandoned masks and other precautions just as delta started spreading.But U.S. health authorities will consider this latest real-world data as they decide if at least some Americans need a booster, and how soon after their last dose. Next week, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will publicly debate Pfizer’s application to offer a third shot.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

By Aya Elamroussi, CNNAs the US averages more than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths daily, not getting vaccinated is akin to driving while intoxicated, one health expert said Friday.“We need to start talking about the choice to remain unvaccinated as the choice to go out and drive intoxicated,” CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.Wen’s remarks come after the Biden administration announced Thursday a Covid-19 vaccine mandate plan that directs the US Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 employees or more to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. President Joe Biden also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to get their Covid-19 vaccine shots, with no option for regular testing to opt out.And while some Republican officials have criticized his move as overreaching, health experts say the President should have implemented stricter measures to curb the recent surge of Covid-19 cases.“From a public health perspective, it is not overreach at all. And in fact, I wish that they came out earlier and went even further,” Wen said. “We’re in the middle of the biggest public health crisis of our lifetimes. We have more than a thousand Americans who are dying every single day. We, as a society, set laws that protect people’s health and well-being all the time.”An average of 1,110 people died in the US from Covid-19 each day over the last week, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed on Thursday. The rate of deaths since late August is the highest it has been since early March.While 73.5% of those ages 12 and up have been vaccinated with at least one dose, tens of millions of eligible recipients remain unvaccinated as the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continues to grip pockets of the country. Around 62% of the same age group is fully vaccinated as of Friday.“The vast minority of Americans are resistant to vaccination, but that’s where the virus has been circulating,” CNN Medical Analyst Jonathan Reiner told CNN’s Don Lemon on Friday. “We live in a country that has rules. You can’t smoke in most buildings in the United States, and you can’t drive drunk. You can’t smoke on planes. And you can’t blow virus into my face.“That’s how it has to be in this country. And if you’re going to be a persistent threat to the public health by refusing to get vaccinated, well your actions have consequences, and the consequences may be you can’t work at your job.”An August poll from Gallup showed that 56% of Americans favor vaccine requirements at work while 53% support them for restaurant dining and 61% approve of them for air travel.And as for those who have not yet gotten their shots, it’s not too late to convince them, former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said Friday.“We need to remember that most of these people are not what I call ‘vaccine-resistant’ — some people say ‘anti-vax,’ I find that term pejorative,” Adams told CNN’s John Berman. “Most of these people are in the movable middle. They’re vaccine-hesitant.“I found that when I talk to them with compassion and with empathy, I can convince a lot of them over time to get their vaccination.”Health care systems strained
Six US states saw at least a 10% increase in new Covid-19 cases in the past week compared to the week before,  showed Friday, while the other states didn’t see a change or experienced a decline in cases altogether.Alabama, one of the states that saw the recent drop in new cases, is now facing a shortage of 60 intensive care unit beds — an uptick of 20 from last Friday, the state’s Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris said.That’s 60 patients “who are receiving critical care because they’re chronically ill, and yet they don’t have an ICU bed,” Harris said Friday.“They’re being cared for in an emergency department or a ward bed that’s been converted to an ICU room or on a gurney in the hallway,” Harris said.Alabama on Thursday reported 2,667 Covid-19 hospitalizations and 53 deaths, he added.In West Virginia, 252 Covid-19 patients are in ICUs and another 141 are on ventilators, marking the most people hospitalized with the disease since the pandemic began, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday.“A high percentage of the folks in the hospitals are unvaccinated,” Justice said. “We lost another 38 people since Wednesday. We’re going to continue to lose people in this surge without any questions,” he said.Minnesota health officials linked at least 69 Covid-19 cases to the State Fair, according to a statement obtained from the state’s health department by CNN affiliate WCCO. The Minnesota State Fair’s website says the event ran from August 25 through September 5 in Falcon Heights.Heated debate over mask mandates 
Meanwhile, the debate over mask mandates remains heated in many states, especially when it comes to schools.In Kentucky, schools will have the choice of whether they will mandate masks, after the General Assembly overrode the governor’s partial veto on that portion of a bill pertaining to Covid-19 provisions in schools, officials say.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear vetoed the part of the SB1 bill that would eliminate the mask mandate for K-12 schools and leave it up to school districts to decide if masking is necessary, he said at a media gaggle on Friday.Beshear said that the Senate’s recent rejection of a statewide school mask mandate is the wrong choice — and one that will reap harmful results.“Mask requirement for schools is not only the right thing to do for our young people, especially those who are too young to even get vaccinated,” Beshear said. “It’s our best way to keep our children learning in the classroom.”Meanwhile in Mississippi, Gov. Tate Reeves said Thursday that Biden’s vaccine mandate plan is unconstitutional.“A member of the executive branch of government does not have the authority to mandate something such as this,” Reeves said.The-CNN-Wire™ &  2021 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

"WATCH: Enhle Mbali excites fans after they spot a ring on her finger - The Citizen
For someone who isn’t doing anything other than simply living her life, ​​Enhle Mbali Mlotshwa enjoys a firm place in the headlines.When we’re not talking about every aspect of her ongoing divorce and related legal battles with her ex-husband, Black Coffee, we’re talking about every other little thing she does.Earlier this week, Enhle made headlines for having her electricity turned off when it turns out that she had just gone on a trip and there was no one home. She then accused the publication responsible for the story of stalking.ALSO READ: She later caught her fans’ attention when she was spotted wearing a ring on her finger during the aforementioned trip.“So glad you still [have] your ring on,” commented @letsoalocynthia to which Enhle replied, “it’s not what you think at all.”“We still remain hopeful [though],” added @slindy_ntusi and was not the only fan who felt that way. Countless fans took to the comments to either speculate that Black Coffee and Enhle would reunite or comment about why and how they think a reunion should happen. Another user, @sinal631, then ventured to find out why she still has the ring on and didn’t get an answer. However, another follower in the comments section claimed that Enhle had previously explained why she still had a ring on that finger. Her comments section devolved into a debate about self-love, marriage, relationships and desperation as some fans advocated for her to return to her marriage despite what had transpired. Others supported her for taking a stand against the ill-treatment she was subjected to by ending the relationship and moving on – whether alone or with a new partner.Enhle moved on with her day and chose not to engage fans about the matter of the ring on her finger. MOST POPULAR PAST 24 HOURS PAST WEEK

After waiting for his big break for almost half of his life, singer Lloyiso has finally been snatched up by Republic Records, the  international record label that houses the likes of Drake, The Weekend and Ariana Grande.Many will remember the smooth-voiced singer from Idols SA, which he entered in 2015, aged 16, and made it as far as the top 5.After the singing competition, Lloyiso took his talent to social media and increased his fan base globally, as he got shout-outs from local and international fans alike for doing popular covers and singing his original songs.After years of putting in the work, Lloyiso now announces his signing with Universal Music Group SA and Republic Records. In addition to making history as the first SA artist to sign to Republic Records, Lloyiso is also releasing his single Seasons.“When I found out that Republic Records wanted to sign me, I kept it to myself until I knew things were actually happening, because I didn’t want to get too excited and honestly, it was just so surreal. After I knew that things were being finalised, I told my closest friends and family members,” Lloyiso told TshisaLIVE.Lloyiso said he was super proud of the work he did to get recognised and grateful to the people  who  cheered him on along the way. He gushed about the plans he had, now that the world was indeed his oyster.“With this international platform, I am going to make more people cry, haha, but on a serious note, I will be able to share my music on a global stage and change people’s lives through my vulnerability in music,” the singer said.Seemingly in agreement that Lloyiso is on the edge of a global takeover, Republic Records executive vice president of A&R, Brett Alperowitz, said the Seasons singer had the making of a superstar.“Lloyiso has all the makings of a career superstar — knockout vocals, incredible songwriting, and an amazing story to tell. He’s the rare talent who not only transcends genres, but crosses borders as well.”Just a month after Lloyiso teased fans with his Seasons TikTok, it inspired 13K-plus creates on the preview alone and the live version of the song has received more than 2-million views thus far on YouTube.Now, the official release highlights his powerhouse vocals front and centre over strains of dramatic piano. The momentum builds towards a soulful and soaring refrain, ""It’s been hard to accept that seasons change and feelings fade, so all I ask, don’t call me.” CEO of Universal Music Africa — Sub Saharan Africa, Sipho Dlamini, beamed with pride over the signing of Lloyiso and watching his star shine globally.“It’s an honour to work with Monte Lipman and the team at Republic Records in launching the career of this amazingly talented soul, Lloyiso. Witnessing the signing of the first South African artist on the Republic roster will inspire others on the continent, and we’re proud to be leading that charge one artist at a time,” said Sipho.",https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/photo/81478822.cms,"Lucky Numbers and Horoscopes for today, 11 September 2021 - The London Economic

"What the world’s most accurate clock can tell us about Earth and the cosmos - The Citizen
It would take 15 billion years for the clock that occupies Jun Ye’s basement lab at the University of Colorado to lose a second — about how long the universe has existed.For this invention, the Chinese-American scientist, along with Hidetoshi Katori of Japan, will split $3 million as co-winners of the 2022 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics.Working independently, the two developed techniques using lasers to trap and cool atoms, then harness their vibrations to drive what are known as “optical lattice clocks,” the most precise timekeeping pieces ever built.By comparison, current atomic clocks lose a second once every 100 million years.But what is gained by greater accuracy?“It’s really an instrument to allow you to probe the basic fabric of space-time in the universe,” Ye told AFP.In Ye’s lab, researchers have shown that time moves slower when the clock is moved closer to the ground by a matter of centimeters, in line with Einstein’s predictions of relativity.Applied to current technology, these clocks could improve GPS navigation accuracy by a factor of a thousand, or help smoothly land an unmanned spaceplane on Mars.Improving the precision and accuracy of timekeeping has been a goal since ancient Egyptians and Chinese made sundials.A key breakthrough came with the invention of the pendulum clock in 1656, which relies on a swinging weight to keep time, and a few decades later chronometers were accurate enough to determine a ship’s longitude at sea.The early 20th century saw the advent of quartz clocks, which when jolted with electricity resonate at very specific, high frequencies, or number of ticks in a second.Quartz clocks are ubiquitous in modern electronics, but are still somewhat susceptible to variations caused by the manufacturing process, or conditions like temperature.The next great leap in timekeeping came from harnessing the movements of energized atoms to develop atomic clocks, which are immune the effects of such environmental variations. Physicists know that a single, very high frequency will cause particles called electrons that orbit the nucleus of a specific type of atom to jump to a higher energy state, finding an orbit further away from the nucleus.Atomic clocks generate the approximate frequency that causes atoms of the element Cesium to jump to that higher energy state. Then, a detector counts the number of those energized atoms, adjusting the frequency if necessary to make the clock more precise. So precise that since 1967, one second has been defined as 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a Cesium atom. Katori’s and Ye’s labs have found ways to improve atomic clocks even further by moving oscillations to the visible end of the electromagnetic spectrum, with frequencies a hundred thousand times higher than those used in current atomic clocks — to make them even more accurate.They realized they needed a way to trap the atoms — in this case, of the element strontium — and hold them still with ultralow temperatures to help measure time properly. If the atoms are falling due to gravity or are otherwise moving, there would be a loss of accuracy, and relativity would cause distorting effects on the timekeeping. To trap the atoms, the inventors created an “optical lattice” made by laser waves moving in opposite directions to form a stationary, egg carton-like shape.Ye is excited about the potential use of his clock. For example, synchronizing the clocks of the world’s best observatories down to the tiniest fractions of a second would allow astronomers to better conceptualize black holes. Better clocks can also shed new light on the Earth’s geological processes.Relativity tells us that time slows down when it approaches a massive body, so a sufficiently accurate clock could tell scientists the difference between solid rock and volcanic lava below the surface, helping to predict an eruption.MOST POPULAR PAST 24 HOURS PAST WEEK

NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has now collected two rock samples, with signs that they were in contact with water for a long period of time boosting the case for ancient life on the Red Planet.“It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,” Ken Farley, project scientist for the mission, said in a statement on Friday. “It’s a big deal that the water was there for a long time.”The six-wheeled robot collected its first sample, dubbed “Montdenier” on September 6, and its second, “Montagnac” from the same rock on September 8.The rover has been operating in a region known as the Jezero Crater, just north of the equator and home to a lake 3.5 billion years ago, when conditions on Mars were much warmer and wetter than today.The rock that provided the first samples was found to be basaltic in composition and likely the product of lava flows.Volcanic rocks contain crystalline minerals that are helpful in radiometric dating.This in turn could help scientists build up a picture of the area’s geological history, such as when the crater formed, when the lake appeared and disappeared, and how climate changed over time.“An interesting thing about these rocks as well is that they show signs for sustained interaction with groundwater,” NASA geologist Katie Stack Morgan told a press conference.The scientists already knew the crater was home to a lake, but couldn’t rule out the possibility that it had been a “flash in the pan” with floodwaters filling up the crater for as little as 50 years.Now they are more certain groundwater was present for much longer.“If these rocks experienced water for long periods of time, there may be habitable niches within these rocks that could have supported ancient microbial life,” added Stack Morgan.The salt minerals in the rock cores may have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water.“Salts are great minerals for preserving signs of ancient life here on Earth, and we expect the same may be true for rocks on Mars,” added Stack Morgan.See the difference EXPLORE MORE",https://africa.cgtn.com/wp-content/photo-gallery/2021/09/VCG111346996457-300x169.jpg,"Humans to Mars Summit 2021 launches next week: How to watch it live online - Space.com

Not all caterpillars grow up to be beautiful butterflies. Some become living milkshakes for their dads, who guzzle caterpillar body fluids to attract the ladies.Recently, scientists reported the first evidence of butterflies sipping from the bodies of caterpillars — dead and alive. They observed adult milkweed butterflies in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, using tiny claws on their feet to scratch wounds in caterpillars' bodies so they could lap the liquid that oozed out. Male butterflies seek certain compounds produced by milkweed (flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae), which repel predators and help the butterflies produce pheromones that attract females. Since caterpillars are stuffed with juices from chewed-up plants, they make an easy target for butterflies looking to chemically boost their attractiveness to females. Related: ""The caterpillar larvae would contort their bodies rapidly in what appeared to be futile attempts to deter the persistent scratching of adults,"" said the researchers who observed the butterfly baby-drinking. They described their observations in a study published Sept. 8 in the journal Ecology.Butterflies in the Danainae family are known as milkweed butterflies because most of the caterpillars in this group feed on milkweed plants, which contain toxic alkaloids that are absorbed by the caterpillars and then processed into useful chemicals that protect them from predators. Another use for these alkaloids is in mating pheromones, which are transferred to females in the males' sperm packet ""as a nuptial gift,"" the scientists wrote.Most milkweed butterfly species are found in Asia, but four species live in North America, one of which is the colorful monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), . Male butterflies in this family are known for a unique behavior called leaf-scratching, in which adults supplement the plant sap they absorbed as hungry caterpillars by scraping at milkweed leaves with their tiny claws to release alkaloid-loaded sap for drinking through their long proboscis. Sometimes males gather by the hundreds to scratch and sip on milkweed leaves, according to the study.But on Dec. 9, 2019, lead study author Yi-Kai Tea, a doctoral candidate in the University of Sydney's School of Life and Environmental Sciences, and co-author Jonathan Soong Wei, a naturalist in Singapore, saw milkweed butterflies in Indonesia's Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve that were scratching at a different sap-loaded source: live milkweed caterpillars.""Multiple adults were observed scratching many caterpillars along a stretch of coastal vegetation"" that spanned more than 1,600 feet (500 meters), the researchers reported. They then saw the butterflies actively drink ""from the wounded and oozing caterpillars"" for hours, with the butterflies sometimes gathering in mixed-species groups. So intent were the butterflies on drinking from the caterpillars that not even the touch of a human observer could distract them, the study authors wrote. To describe the behavior, the scientists coined the term ""kleptopharmacophagy,"" which means ""consuming stolen chemicals.""""The alternative neologisms 'kairopharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from wounded caterpillars detected via 'eavesdropping') or 'necropharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from dead caterpillars) might also be appropriate,"" the researchers reported.— ——Over three days, the scientists counted seven species of milkweed butterflies that scraped and sipped living and dead caterpillars (it is unknown if the dead caterpillars were drunk to death or died of their wounds). One possible explanation for why the butterflies find caterpillars so delicious is because milkweed alkaloids accumulate in the caterpillars' bodies from the leaves that they eat, making their internal ""juices"" a more potent, alkaloid-rich brew — and thereby more attractive to thirsty males, the scientist suggested. It's likely that the butterflies are drawn to milkweed leaves that are already damaged from caterpillar chewing; those caterpillars would be close by when the adults start scratching. If a butterfly accidentally scrapes a caterpillar, the wound would release a heady chemical scent that would attract the butterfly and encourage it to scratch the caterpillar even more, according to the study. Many questions remain about this unusual (and ghastly) behavior, such as which specific plant compounds attract the butterflies to the caterpillars and do butterflies in other parts of the world also practice baby-drinking, Tea said in a statement. ""These simple observations raise questions about the ecology of these well-known butterflies, providing numerous opportunities for future studies,"" he said.Originally published on Live Science.Mindy Weisberger is a Live Science senior writer covering a general beat that includes climate change, paleontology, weird animal behavior, and space.

Space technology is complicated. Whether it’s a crewed spaceship or a large structure like the International Space Station (ISS), when astronauts need to maintain or replace certain components it’s never a simple task. Currently, repairs like those performed on the ISS are overseen by staff on the ground, who have access to all the schematics and information about the components and instruct astronauts on what to do, one step at a time.But for future missions, especially those eventually venturing out further into the solar system such as to Mars, there will be a significant communications delay between Earth and the astronauts which makes this approach impractical. Astronauts will need to be able to make repairs or changes by themselves, without so much immediate guidance from the ground. To help with this, astronauts on the ISS are testing out a new Augmented Reality (AR) system which can help in the inspection and maintenance of station equipment.The T2 Augmented Reality project uses familiar consumer hardware like Microsoft HoloLens AR googles plus specially-developed NASA software to give astronauts guidance and instructions for performing tasks like inspecting scientific equipment or maintaining on-station exercise equipment. The idea is to load up the software with instructions for various operations which the crew can access when they need it.“AR tools hold the promise of allowing us to pre-package guidance and expertise,” said International Space Station associate scientist Bryan Dansberry at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. “The space station is the perfect platform to test out AR systems and refine these tools so they will be ready when future astronauts need them. Closer to home, these tests help to mature software and AR technology now so expertise and support are available in remote locations around the world.”So far, the system has been tested by JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi, who used it to maintain the space station’s treadmill, and by European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet and NASA astronaut Megan McArthur. The crew is planning another nine test sessions to try out the procedure and learn more about what does and doesn’t work. For now, the system will be used only for the treadmill, but in the future, this approach could be used to maintain other pieces of equipment and could even be used by astronauts traveling to the moon or Mars.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png

If you grew up in the late ’80s, you’ll remember the euphoria of opening a present and realising it was a  action figure. Heck, you didn’t even care if there was a shortage of the main characters, because even Moss-Man and Fisto were awesome to have in your collection.
Well, now in 2021, the Power of Grayskull is back! Not just on Netflix, with the two MOTU shows, but also in the toy stores. Yip, the O.G.  action figures are back on the shelves.
Mattel sent us a few He-Man and Masters of the Universe figures to check out, so let’s see if the power is still there.

Faker
Who the hell is Faker? Ah, if you recall, he was one of Skeletor’s cronies, who was the perfect merger between He-Man and the great bonehead himself. He possessed Skeletor’s blue skin and purple attire, while he was blessed (or cursed) with He-Man’s face and bad hairstyle.
Taking one look at this figure, it looks like a picture-perfect replica of the original line, including its mini comic titled “Sucker Punch”—but it’s not. The power punch action has been removed and the figure is far better for it, as it shows just how far toy design has come in over three decades.
While he still comes with a removable chest plate and sword, there are far more points of articulation and you can take off his belt too. The feet, knees, legs, arms, elbows, and hands are all movable, allowing for more detailed poses and movement. Plus, if you have other figures, you can also remove and swap out body parts, to create a unique-looking figurine. So, go ahead and live out your Frankenstein dream here!

Panthor
While everyone harps on about how cool Battle Cat is, let’s not forget that Panthor was the real MVP of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. Skeletor’s trusty companion was released in 1983 as a 5-inch figure with velvet-like fur and a detachable saddle. However, over time, this fur would fade and you’d have a patchier and worn-out Panthor.
This new version of the character is an upgrade and a half. While the 1983 first edition of Panthor had one singular pose, this new version has several points of articulation, allowing for more interaction and poses with other characters. Additionally, his head and mouth are fully movable, so if you want to put Prince Adam’s head in his mouth for him to chew on, you can do so without hassle.
Whereas before Panthor felt like a limited figurine or statue, Skeletor’s companion now feels like a fully-fledged character in this toy line. He’s totally purr-fect!
Make sure you check out our review of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe figures below.

Remember the days when cellphones were only used to make calls? Now they’re the ultimate, all-in-one device for media, messaging, mobile gaming and everything in-between. So if you’re going to get a new smartphone, you’re likely wanting to get one with the best camera (and at the best price) and Huawei’s new Nova 8 is just that. The Nova 8 is a media consumption powerhouse. It’s a beautiful-looking device with an impressive 6.57-inch curved screen, OLED display and other notable hardware specs that promise to enhance your smartphone experience. The Nova 8 is a mere 7.64mm thick and only weighs 169g which means it’s comfortable to hold and fits nicely in your palm.Even if photography or videography isn’t your thing, the Nova 8 still stands out. Visually, it’s similar to a DSLR camera and the camera nodule is unlike the conventional rectangular camera designs. Huawei has taken the design aesthetics one step further with the Nova 8 by releasing it in an eye-catching blush gold colour that catches the light in a mesmerising holographic way. The cameras and flash are arranged to mimic the Nova logo on the back of the smartphone – it’s that sleek. If you’re looking to capture every moment, the Nova 8’s HD multi-camera system is equipped with a Kirin 830E chipset, designed to make everything as smooth as can be, when it comes to photo or video editing. This smartphone is ideal for anyone who considers their camera one of the most important features.Inspired by the rings of Saturn, Huawei’s Nova 8 has an iconic Nebular camera system design. While that may sound out a little out of this world, what you really need to know is that there are four cameras and they all work together beautifully: a 64Mp high-res main camera, an ultra-wide angle camera, a dedicated bokeh camera, and a macro camera. The Nova 8 also uses 4-in-1 light fusion technology - think perfect shots, no matter the time of day – and an enhanced, anti-distortion AI algorithm that stitches together multiple photos to ensure that what you end up with in your gallery is sharp, bright and beautiful. What would a smartphone be without the ability to take incredible selfies? The Nova 8’s impressive 32MP, punch hole high-res front camera is a big part of the package. What we really like about the selfie cam is that is supports Huawei’s Super Night Selfie Mode which automatically enhances faces and improves background details. The Nova 8 also has a powerful built-in AI algorithm for selfies that intelligently removes flares from glasses which can be problematic when shooting at night. (Consider that little issue a thing of the past.)The rear camera supports dual-view video with HD 1080p output. Using this mode, you can capture two different perspectives at once by independently filming on two cameras instead of one! When using the front camera, dual-view shows what's captured by the front camera and rear camera side-by-side. When using the rear camera, the dual view shows a panorama and a close-up of the centre of what's being filmed – brilliant!It doesn’t make a difference if you’re all about Instagram Reels or enjoying those TikTok life hacks and want to start filming some of your own, the Nova 8 is a handset designed for innovation and for creating the best content. But it’s much more than that – it has a big battery, supports fast charging (hello Huawei SuperCharge!) and has lots of smart features you’re going to love. Pre-order the Huawei Nova 8 now for just R99 and get R1,100 off*. Receive the Huawei FreeBuds 4i and Huawei Watch GT Bundle offer valued at R5,698. Visit the Huawei Store for more details. Terms and conditions apply.The Huawei Nova 8 comes with a two-year warranty, one-time free screen guard service, free unboxing service at the store and 50-days screen insurance.This article was paid for by Huawei.", https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1583248045.jpg,"How to allow pop-ups on an iPhone using Safari or Chrome - Business Insider South Africa
Most people consider pop-ups to be one of the internet's worst features. But despite how spammy they can be, a lot of legitimate websites use them for important reasons.

If longtime fans of Oxenfree have thought about jumping back into the adventure on PC before , they might be surprised to find some radio transmissions they didn't find the first time around. And if you're one of those players, don't worry - you're not forgetting some key story beats or realizing you missed some important conversations. Five years after its release, Night School Studio has periodically been updating its acclaimed, original choice-driven narrative with a series of new audio teases that directly tie into the villains of Oxenfree II.It's an ambitious gambit, but absolutely befitting of Oxenfree's paranormal, meta-story. The villains of the upcoming sequel are so powerful, or messing with forces that are, that they're literally changing the fabric of the original's world and appearing, at least audibly, where they once weren't. Night School Studio has dipped into fourth-wall-breaking territory before, but to find out more about this exciting undertaking, I spoke with members of the Night School team about why they decided to bridge the games like this, how it prepares players for the sequel, and more.Some details may be considered spoilers for Oxenfree II, so turn back if you don't want to know any details about the sequel ahead of its launch. Otherwise, watch the new video below for more on Oxenfree's updates and how they set up the villains of Oxenfree II.A couple of  of Oxenfree have already gone live, and fans have been piecing together what these radio broadcasts might be leading toward. And as perceptive fans may have already realized, these broadcasts are offering insight into the world of the sequel's villains, a collective group known as Parentage. These broadcasts offer players who discover them a bit of characterization and background for these characters, while also showing how significant a force they might be if their actions are reverberating through the original game. It's a startling approach, but one that the developers felt was absolutely natural to the world they've created and are now building upon.""The rules of the world, and the rules of the universe, allows things that happen in the future to reverberate into the past, and vice-versa,"" Studio Lead Writer Adam Hines told IGN.""We wanted to make sure that we went deeper with it [than other ARGs], and made sure to honor the Night School pillars of really strong characters, really compelling dialogue, and nice and scary as well,"" Writer Adam Esquenazi Douglas added.In that sense, as Douglas explained, the radio updates being added for players to discover are aimed to feel like a complete story themselves, with a beginning, middle, and end that should satisfy those who discover them all, while also offering depth to what's to come in the sequel. And the team is highly aware of the challenges that come with telling such a story, in such a peculiar way, namely in not wanting to spoil the experience of the sequel, and in producing a story in this series of transmissions that not all Oxenfree II players may experience.""We're always very cautious about spoilers and not wanting to ruin the mystery aspect. That's such a big chunk of why people play these types of games is being able to really dig in as much as they want,"" Hines said. ""We landed in a really good spot of giving hints of intent, and giving hints that someone is really intentionally trying to push their way into what Alex and her friends unwittingly stumbled into in Oxenfree 1, and got stuck in and had to deal with. Now, with Oxenfree II, we're dealing with a group that is very specifically and intentionally trying to uncover and discover this stuff. And, poke at it and see what you can do with portals, time, and space.""Of course it's all going to go horribly wrong. So, we get to see hints of that through these radio updates,"" Hines continued. ""This is giving you a sense of who the quote-unquote bad guys are going to be for Oxenfree II. And, then also when you start to play Oxenfree II, and start to push up against these characters and meet them, if you've done the radio update journey from Oxenfree 1, hopefully that will feel like you already have a sense of how they got to where they are.""""There was never a clear antagonist [in Oxenfree 1],"" Studio Director Sean Krankel elaborated. ""We're dropping you into this weird mystery island, and you're going to have to unravel it. And, we didn't think we could do that again this time, frankly. And, so introducing the antagonists in an interesting way just felt like a compelling, cool thing to do instead of having a trailer just focused on them. Why not let you hear them doing their dirty work in the first game?""That sets the table for players exploring these audio logs to have some fascinating insight into Parentage ahead of Oxenfree II, but Night School was also very cognizant that not every player who jumps into the sequel may have discovered or even heard these radio additions. In that sense the team worked hard to make something rewarding for players, both in the act of discovering it and what it entailed, but also something that, should you miss out on this bit of worldbuilding, won't hamper a player's experience of the sequel.As these updates are sound-based radio transmissions, they tie into a common element of Oxenfree - its evocative sound design. So much of Oxenfree's mood-setting came through audio, whether it be the voice acting, the glitchy sound effects of its supernatural-meets-real-world story, or the memorable score by Composer Andy Rohrmann, aka scntfc. And as Rohrmann explains, these radio updates provide further ways for him to not only play with what he's done before, but tie it into Oxenfree's world in fascinating ways.""Some [ways the score is integrated] are just kind of fun musical tricks. But, there's also ideas of music that might show up in the radio plays is actual [Oxenfree] score. But we're using it diegetically in this instance. So...they break a lot of these concepts of 'What is the game,'"" Rohrmann explained.These radio plays, and the connective tissue that then gives the two games, also gave Rohrmann a unique opportunity to work with the first game's soundtrack in a way that not only let the new music be in dialogue with that first score, but also speak to the wider themes at play.""There's actually time looping, and the way these narrative threads are structured, makes it almost make too much sense to go back and rework something,"" he said. ""I'm not saying it's less work, but, it's a great opportunity to essentially remix my own work in relevant ways.""Though Rohrmann did not, of course, want to spoil what work he may be doing with this ARG or ahead of the sequel that could lead to Oxenfree II clues, he did point to an ARG moment in the past that gives an indication of what may come.""I'll give one more example just because this may be relevant in the future. We seeded ARG elements six months before Oxenfree one came out, which was a song I said, ""Oh, here's a song from this game. You can listen to it if you want.' It had morse coding. People have since realized that the melody was playing morse code. They would have been onto something six months before the game came out, but, obviously nobody knew who it was. So, it sat dormant until the week of the game coming out. Then, people thought 'Oh, that's morse code.' ""Once I discovered [that people realized this], I could change it because front-facing on band camp, you can't tell if a file has changed. And, so we got to play with this idea of time in the real world; 'I went there yesterday, and then I downloaded it today, and it's different.'And Rohrmann's work may be more relevant to Oxenfree than some fans may realize.""Andy really has been so much of the foundation of the more mind-bendy aspects of the game. In the first one, everything from his actual recording process, which was super analog. He literally broadcast himself, recorded the broadcast, and then put them on a reel and stretched it out and broke it up. All that stuff leads into the design. The tape reels from the first game, dealing with time loops, all that Andy heavily influenced,"" Krankel said.""The foundation [of Oxenfree] is already begging to be messed with, to be meta and strange,"" Krankel continued. ""Audio and radio broadcasts being the foundation of how you interact with that has meant that Andy has been more than a composer. He is really like a designer on this project and was on the first one as well.""Night School has a history with ARG's and Oxenfree, the original of which actually involved real-world locations, but tried their best to play up the mystery of it. And the funny thing about ARGs for fictional stories is where the creators draw the line. To acknowledge an ARG is going on breaks some of the fun that comes from imagining a story bleeding into our world. Then again, actually addressing it helps bring awareness, more curiosity, and, ultimately, more chances for fans to collaborate and work on piecing everything together. And, frankly, it's cool when a story can be told in such a unique way like this.""With the first game, it was important to be secretive about it because the world was being introduced to these characters and this lore. And, we also just didn't think anybody was looking at us. If anything, they were looking at the game,"" Krankel said. ""Any ARG components a few years ago, we wanted them under this shroud of secrecy. But, as we've moved forward, and as we're building out this next team, the way that we look at it is there can be multiple touchpoints that tell a singular story.""""As much effort as goes into the game's story, is going into this story, and it's all intended to be one singular piece of work. It just so happens that part of it isn't in Oxenfree II. Before we cared about being top secret about everything, now we want everybody to know it's out there, and see it and feel it.""""We've been trying to strike a delicate balance between wanting to give enough that you want to know more. But, not too much that it feels like the apple has gone rotten,"" Hines added.""This is great because now it's not so much waiting for a puzzle so people can rush to solve it [like in other ARGs]. It's more a story, and it's more narrative,"" Rohrmann said.And Night School very knowingly made this interwoven story with the idea that fans would dissect every element of it, and hope that process will be as rewarding as it was coming up with how to implement it.""One of the great things about our fan base is that no matter what we put out they will pick it apart to the atoms, just to figure out what we're going for,"" Douglas said. ""And, we wrote a lot of this content specifically with them in mind. So, whenever a sentence stops halfway through and you really want that sentence to finish. That's why we did it. It's because of you.""""There are still things out there that we've already dropped, that had yet to be discovered,"" Rohrmann said. ""We've already seeded mysteries and things. So, it's been really fun to take those ideas and integrate them into a game that came out five years ago. I mean, that's so cool. How often does that happen?""Oxenfree II is headed to PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch in 2022.

"Eskom's Kendal power plant catches fire - IOL
Share this article:Cape Town – Another Eskom power plant has caught fire, forcing the power utility to shut down some of the affected units.Eskom confirmed on Saturday that unit 1 at Kendal station in Mpumalanga tripped, and when an investigation was conducted it was found that it had caught fire.However, investigations were under way to determine the cause of the fire.This is the second Eskom power plant that has been affected by a fire, after there was an explosion at Medupi a few weeks ago.The damage to that unit was still being investigated and it is believed it would take some time before the unit is repaired.Eskom said unit 1 tripped at Kendal power station this morning after the generator transformer failed.“Upon initial investigation, it was determined that the generator transformer had caught fire. The fire damaged the cables to the main cooling water system on the west side of the power station. Unit 2 and 3 experienced loss of vacuum and were shut down under controlled conditions,” said Eskom in a statement.When an explosion happened at Medupi’s unit 4 it was estimated that this would cost billions of rands to repair.Deputy President David Mabuza said recently that the investigation was under way on the explosion, and once concluded, they would report back to the public.Medupi is one of the coal-fired power stations that has not yet been completed after years under construction and delays.Share this article:",https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/320/270308-Eskom-and-Load-shedding-An-early-morning-picture-taken-at-Matla-Power-Station-in-Mpumalanga-Province-Picture-Dumisani-Sibeko?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/3d6f0133-c4d5-5afe-abcf-3568f952b6d6,"ANC: Zille made spurious allegations against party, harmed Concourt's reputation - IOL
Share this article:THE ANC has accused DA federal council chairperson Helen Zille of making spurious, unfounded and vexatious accusations against the governing party and harming the reputation of the Constitutional Court.In its notice of further grounds to oppose the DA’s apex court application to have the decision to reopen the candidate nomination process for the 2021 local government elections declared unconstitutional, unlawful and invalid, the ANC also accused the official opposition of trying to second-guess the Electoral Commission of SA (IEC).”The DA has publicly made spurious, unfounded and vexatious accusations against the ANC and this Court, in which it claimed that the ANC had received advance warning of the content of the judgment delivered on 4 September 2021.The DA’s comments were false, but the DA made them knowing them to be false and without any regard to the impact they have on the public perception about the standing and reputation of this court,” read the ANC’s grounds for opposition filed this week.In the days leading up to the Constitutional Court’s judgment on the IEC’s bid to have the municipal polls postponed, Zille claimed that the ANC withdrew its Electoral Court application to have the candidate nomination process reopened because it received advance warning of the contents of the judgment that dismissed the commission's attempt to have the November 1 elections shelved until February next year.However, the ANC has told the apex court that the accusation is false and has been made recklessly by the DA.”The DA has made scurrilous and baseless accusations that the ANC is working clandestinely with the IEC or that the IEC has intentionally sought to favour the ANC ... These allegations were made with reckless disregard about the damaging impact of the statements to the standing of the IEC as an independent institution,” the governing party explained.According to the ANC, the Municipal Electoral Act requires the IEC to have regard to the freeness and fairness of elections when amending the election timetable.”The IEC’s determination can only be challenged on circumscribed grounds, such as irrationality and unreasonableness, but may not be second-guessed as the DA wrongly seeks to do. The DA’s arguments are irrational,” the ANC stated.The ANC said the DA concedes that fresh registration of candidates will be permissible in “certain circumstances”, but it irrationally argues that in the present case, the commission should not have amended the timetable to allow all candidates who wish to register afresh.The distinction sought to be drawn by the DA in the matter is wholly irrational and borders on abuse of court process, according to the ANC.In its notice to oppose, the IEC argues that the relief sought by the DA is untenable in law, premature on facts and amounts to an impermissible attempt by a political party involved in an election to have the Constitutional Court second-guess its decisions concerning the proper holding of polls midway through the electoral process.The IEC also accused the DA of failing to take into account the need for affording appropriate respect to the commission in making decision in fulfilment of its constitutional duty to ensure free and fair elections.In a directive issued on Thursday, the Constitutional Court gave the IEC, the ANC and any other party opposing the DA’s application until midday on Monday to file their answering affidavits.The DA must file its replying affidavit by Tuesday while the IEC, ANC and any other party or amicus curiae (friend of the court) have to file their written submissions no later than Wednesday.Share this article:",https://image-prod.iol.co.za/16x9/320/Cape-Town-04-08-16-The-IEC-result-center-at-Century-City-Premier-Helen-Zille-answers-questions-from-the-media-pic-brenton-geach?source=https://xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443/opencontent/objects/51eabd06-b908-50d2-9d09-2df216fedbc3,"Mourners break barricades to attend funeral of kaMagwaza-Msibi - Eyewitness News
