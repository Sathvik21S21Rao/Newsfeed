"Azeem Rafiq gives evidence to MPs in DCMS cricket racism hearing – live - The Guardian
Efford asks if Rafiq thinks people at the top of Yorkshire CC could have been unaware of the problems with racism.They could have had that excuse before I spoke to them, says Rafiq, but not afterwards. “I made it perfectly clear,” he adds. “We need to get away from looking for excuses for these individuals.”Efford asks about the ECB.Rafiq says he spoke to Tom Harrison. “I felt like he was listening but they took the stance that they were going to trust Yorkshire to do the right thing.” He says he kept begged the ECB and PCA to step in but that neither of the two organisations wanted to. Rafiq says he had dark moments over the winter and at one point the PCA reported him missing. He says he doesn’t think that was done out of concern for his mental health but that they “wanted to tick a box just in case I killed myself”.Clive Efford MP takes over the questioning. He asks about Rafiq’s experience at Derbyshire.“I had the most enjoyable month on loan at Derby,” says Rafiq. “The captain and the coach made me feel welcomed and valued. I have nothing but good things to say about my time at Derby, though I was only there a short time.Efford asks whether the problems with south Asian representation is peculiar to Yorkshire.People got sick and tired of not getting opportunities, says Rafiq. It’s on the ECB, he adds, for too long they have not done enough.Brennan asks about Rafiq’s sister’s work at Leicestershire.Rafiq says his family didn’t know what he was going through until last year. He says he has spoken to his sister at length since and has no doubt that racism is a problem up and down the country. Throughout this process my own community and businesses in Bradford have tried to help Yorkshire cover this up, he says. People just don’t want to listen, he says. “Good people who are not racist just want to look the other way.”Kevin Brennan MP asks about Michael Vaughan.Rafiq says he “doesn’t want to make it all about Michael”. “Michael might not remember it because it doesn’t mean anything to him,” he adds. Here’s our first take of the news so far today:Green asks about .“Rooty is a good man, he’s never engaged in racist language,” says Rafiq. “I found [his comments] hurtful. He was Gary’s flatmate. He was involved in social nights out during which I was called a Paki. He might not remember [the incidents of racism] but it shows how normal it was that even a good man like him doesn’t see it for what it is.”Green asks if racism is institutional in cricket.Yes, says Rafiq. It’s not just at Yorkshire, he says – the ECB has to take a bit of responsibility. “This is a problem up and down the country.” He says the ECB need to stop “palming off responsibilities”.Damien Green MP now. He asks why did Rafiq return to Yorkshire after leaving once?Rafiq says he knew something wasnt right in first spell but wasn’t sure what it was. He says he was in denial right up to 2017. He says Derbyshire couldn’t offer him a contract and he was struggling to put food on the table.Simon Jupp resumes. He asks about the response on social media.Rafiq says all he wanted was acceptance, an apology and to work to make sure his situation didn’t happen again. He says he was met by denials. “Social media was my voice. I was determined to become a voice for the voiceless. A professional player messaged me to say ‘You’ve done what we all wanted to do but didn’t have the balls to do it.’ My family has been abused, I’ve been abused. I can take it and I will take it because it’s something I’m passionate about. If Yorkshire had seen this as a chance to become leaders in this space it could have gone very differently.”Conservative Simon Jupp MP takes over the questioning. He asks about the delay in the allegations being made.Rafiq says he was encouraged to sign a confidentiality agreement before leaving Yorkshire. He says he wasn’t in the right frame of mind at the time and he left the country, went to Pakistan, and that he never wanted to come back.Jupp asks how he summoned the strength to do this.I’ve got a bit of Karachi and a bit of Barnsley in me, says Rafiq. “I don’t know how I’ve done it, I really don’t …”A tearful Rafiq can’t go on, so the meeting his adjourned for a few minutes.Knight asks about the lack of south Asian representation in the Yorkshire squad.Rafiq says the lack of players is “scary”. “As I’ve seen over the last 15 months, if you speak out your life is going to be made hell.” Knight asks about the allegations that have emerged at other clubs.Rafiq says the problem is widespread. British Asian representation in cricket since 2010 has dropped by 40%. He says many of the ECB’s initiatives to tackle racism are box-ticking and focussed on grassroots rather than in the professional game.Tell us about Kevin and Steve, says Knight.“Kevin” was something Ballance used to describe anyone of colour, says Rafiq. This was widely known, he adds. He says Alex Hales, Ballance’s friend and teammate, went on to name his dog “Kevin”, because the dog was black. Knight says the report mentions Rafiq’s drinking.Rafiq says he did things he isn’t proud of to fit in but says it has nothing to do with racism.Knight asks if he was ever forced to drink under the age of 18.Rafiq says he was pinned down as a 15-year-old in club cricket and had red wine poured down his throat. He says a player who played for Yorkshire and Hampshire was involved.Knight: what are your views of the report and how it was handled? (Knight describes the report as a “venn diagram of stupidity”)Rafiq says he only got it a week ago, and says it seems others got it before him (referring ). He says he wanted to see if his experience could help others. Institutional racism isn’t something anyone wants to be associated with. Says the lawyers who conducted the report were “brilliant” at the start but when they got his evidence things changed, making it about individuals rather than the club.“To be clear,” says Rafiq, “Paki is not banter, racism is not banter.” Knight: the attitude of Yorkshire changed when you made a complaint?Rafiq says board minutes show he was considered a leader, a future captain. He made a complaint about Tim Bresnan, and things changed.After the stillbirth of his son he says Martyn Moxon “tore a strip” off him. Rafiq says he had never seen him talk to anyone like that before.Knight asks about Gary Ballance. Rafiq says their relationship started to deteriorate due to his conduct. His says Ballance’s behaviour grew “disgusting”. He describes the atmosphere in the dressing room under Ballance as “toxic”.Rafiq continues on his second spell with the club: “Andrew Gale came in as coach, Gary Ballance as captain, and the temperature changed. I felt isolated. Ballance came over and said: “Why are you talking to him, he’s not a Sheikh, he hasn’t got oil.”Everyone saw it, says Rafiq. No one did anything about it.He says his treatment by the club was “inhuman” during the difficult pregnancy of his son, then has to pause.Q: What went wrong at Yorkshire for you?Towards the end of my first spell but constantly throughout I knew there was something wrong. I started taking medication for my mental health. It was really tough.DCMS chair Julian Knight MP welcomes everyone to the committee and says he had “widespread refusals” from people asked to give evidence. Azeem Rafiq is in place and ready to go.As ever with these things, it looks like we’re not going to start absolutely on time. Hopefully the delay will only be a minute or two.Tanya Aldred’s profile in the Observer on Sunday outlines Rafiq’s remarkable career:His evidence today is certain to make deeply uncomfortable viewing for many in the sport. Parliamentary privilege means he is free to talk about all of his complaints without fear of legal reprisal. He has previously indicated he is ready to name names. also looks at the scandal: Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2021/11/15-77872-TIF_Yorkshire.mp3 This timeline from PA Media helps illustrate Azeem Rafiq’s long road to this point:2 September 2020 In an interview with ESPNcricinfo, former England Under-19 captain Rafiq reveals: “I know how close I was to committing suicide during my time at Yorkshire” over what he describes as “institutional racism” at the county.3 September Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton confirms a formal investigation into Rafiq’s claims will “start in a matter of days” and be conducted “thoroughly, impartially and with urgency”.18 August 2021 ECB chair Ian Watmore calls on Yorkshire to provide a copy of the investigation’s findings after he confirms the independent enquiry had sent its conclusions to the county, with Rafiq revealing his exasperation with the continued delays to the process.19 August Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of “fudging” his claims of institutional racism after the county apologise to the former spinner for being the “victim of inappropriate behaviour” but insist “many of the allegations were not upheld” in a lengthy statement.10 September Yorkshire release a summarised version of their independent report, where they apologise and accept Rafiq had been the victim of “racial harassment and bullying” in his two spells at the club between 2008 and 2018, but after only seven of Rafiq’s 43 allegations were upheld the county insist there is insufficient evidence to prove or disprove institutionalised racism.7 October A spokesperson for Rafiq accuses Yorkshire of “protecting the players and a coach who they now acknowledge used either racist language or were bullying” with the full report still not published.28 October Yorkshire announce no individuals will face disciplinary action despite seven of Rafiq’s allegations being upheld.2 November ESPNcricinfo reveals details of the report into Rafiq’s claims, which includes the admission of one senior player that he used the P-word reference to Rafiq, but Yorkshire conclude the incidents in question amounted to “friendly banter”. 3 November Emerald Group Publishing, Yorkshire Tea and Anchor Butter all end their association with Yorkshire over the handling of Rafiq’s allegations. Meanwhile, former England batter Gary Ballance reveals he used “a racial slur” against Rafiq but claimed both men “said things privately to each other which were not acceptable”. 4 November The ECB suspends Yorkshire from hosting international or major matches, while Ballance is “suspended indefinitely” from England selection.5 November Ahead of an emergency board meeting Hutton resigns as Yorkshire chairman, calling on the executive board to follow suit and saying he was “saddened” after claiming the ECB declined to help in their enquiry. Former Yorkshire all-rounder Rana Naved-ul-Hasan claims he heard former England captain Michael Vaughan make inappropriate comments to Asian players at the club, something which Rafiq had also alleged and which Vaughan denies.11 November Mark Arthur resigns as Yorkshire’s chief executive. Hello and welcome to live coverage of today’s digital, culture, media and sport committee hearing called to examine Yorkshire’s county cricket club’s response to the racism allegations made by Azeem Rafiq.The hearing begins at 9.30am GMT with Rafiq’s evidence; Roger Hutton, Yorkshire’s former chairman, is expected at around 10.15am, and the ECB chief executive Tom Harrison at 11.15am. Other ECB representatives are also scheduled to appear: Kate Miller, the chief diversity and communications officer; Meena Botros, the director of legal and integrity, and Alan Dickinson, a non-executive director.This, , outlines why we are here today:In 2020 Azeem Rafiq went public with allegations of the racism he says he experienced while a player at Yorkshire during two spells from 2008 to 2014 and 2016 to 2018. This prompted a 12-month investigation by the club, with a summary of the resulting report released in September upholding seven of Rafiq’s 43 claims and confirming he was the victim of “racial harassment” in his first spell and bullying during the second.Despite a conclusion that the club failed to properly escalate his initial complaints in 2018 as per its own policies, the club announced on 28 October that no action would be taken against any current employee. This, plus a leaked element of the still unpublished report that showed the panel considered the use of the P-word towards Rafiq to be “in the spirit of friendly banter”,  earlier this month and saw Julian Knight, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, set up Tuesday’s hearing to get to the bottom of the issue.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2125c0cadc263065701fe6f3cecccc224794f89c/160_15_3118_1871/master/3118.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1a80e78ff723e18858490b5b87df735e,"Derby receive fresh points deduction, England book place for Qatar 2022, Southgate hails Kane as records... - talkSPORT.com

The transformation of Scotland under Steve Clarke continued with this unforgettable victory before a capacity crowd at Hampden Park, who witnessed Denmark beaten by goals in each half from John Souttar and Che Adams to guarantee a seeded place in the World Cup play-offs with the advantage of a home tie in the semi-finals. It is an extraordinary tributeto the manager’s trust in his players that the Scottish support is entitled to believe that this team are now a match for anybody on their home turf.Clarke’s immediate problem was that half of his outfield contingent were walking the edge of suspensions which would keep them out of the playoffs. Stephen O’Donnell, Billy Gilmour, Andy Robertson, John McGinn and Adams all came into that category, their manager having admitted that he had considered encouraging certain individuals to pick up cautions in the 2-0 win over Moldova in Chisinau on Friday but had dismissed the notion as more trouble than it was worth.As matters stood, Clarke was forced to do without Nathan Patterson, scorer of the Scots’ opener in Moldova, who did earn a yellow card in Chisinau and was suspended for this tie, his place was taken by Stephen O’Donnell. In addition, Lyndon Dykes – whom the manager had rated 50/50 at best because of an ankle problem – was ruled out.Another casualty – not one who had been anticipated – was Jack Hendry, whose place on the right edge of the back three was taken by Souttar, on his fourth appearance for Scotland. Ryan Christie, meanwhile, came in for Stuart Armstrong and, along with John McGinn, supported Adams as the spearhead.When these teams met in Copenhagen on September 1, the opening 45 minutes were effectively a no-contest, with the Danes 2-0 to the good after only quarter of an hour. Mindful of that pain, the Scots played their way steadily into a dominant rhythm on this occasion, although a vulnerable gap between the back line and midfield was to be seen from time to time.Happily for the Tartan Army, the Danes’ attempts to use their speed to catch Scotland on the counterattack came to nothing and their first real menace, when Daniel Wass made contact with a cross 12 yards out, induced audible relief from the tartan ranks in the stands when the ball skipped off the midfielder’s thigh and behind for a goal kick. Other than that – and a powerful drive from beyond the box by Andreas Christensen, which swept a foot over Craig Gordon’s goal – Denmark offered little by way of menace, somewhat understandable because they were short of several first-choice players.The Scots would have taken the lead midway through the first half but for a trademark intervention by Kasper Schmeichel, who stuck out his left foot to divert a low drive by Adams for another of the succession of corner kicks they were amassing. Nothing came of the set-piece on this occasion but it was from a corner that the breakthrough arrived 10 minutes before the break.The execution was reminiscent of the winning goal in Scotland’s 3-2 victory over Israel at Hampden last month, when a McGinn corner was headed across goal by Hendry for Scott McTominay to head home at the back post. On this occasion, it was Liam Cooper who directed McGinn’s delivery back across the box for Souttar to head home from six yards. As Hampden erupted in raucous celebration, the Danish contingent were obliged to absorb the fact that their team had fallen behind for the first time since Harry Kane netted England’s winning goal in the Euro 2021 semi-final at Wembley.Gordon had not been obliged to make his obligatory world-class stop in the first half but he gratified the home audience eight minutes after the interval when he uncoiled his body to get a glove to a bullet header from Andreas Cornelius although, as it transpired, a Danish goal would have been ruled out for offside.Stung by the durability of Scotland’s lead, Kasper Hjulmand sent on Jens Stage and Pione Sisto for Jens Jensson and Bruun Larsen. Sisto became the focus of Denmark’s attempt to annul the deficit and his quick feet presented a vivid contrast to the tiring limbs of the Scots, manifested when Robertson and Gilmour both slumped to the turf holding their calves.Kenny McLean and Scott McKenna were sent on to bolster the resistance as the Danes imposed a chokehold on the home defence but it was Scotland who forced the decisive break to spring Adams free of the Danish back line to draw Schmeichel and strike the guarantee goal from just inside the box, for another landmark victory under Clarke.And, as ‘Yes Sir, I Can Boogie’ was roared by the exultant home crowd, Clarke had the additional satisfaction of knowing that – barring injury – he will have all his players available for the run-in to what could be the Scots’ first World Cup appearance since 1998.We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Visit our adblocking instructions

"UK unemployment rate falls to 4.3%, and company payrolls rise again – business live - The Guardian
Energy news: the International Energy Agency has predicted that the surge in oil prices could ease, as production picks up.In its monthly report, the Paris-based agency explains that the rise in prices (Brent crude hit a three-year high last month) should spur global production, particularly in the United States.“The world oil market remains tight by all measures, but a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon ... due to rising oil supplies.” “Current prices provide a strong incentive to boost (U.S.) activity even as operators stick to capital discipline pledges.”The end of the furlough scheme in October has not sparked fresh a labour market shock as many had feared, says the Resolution Foundation.They point out that employment was rising and unemployment was falling as the scheme ended, with a record number of people moving into new jobs (see here)The early signs for the UK’s post-furlough labour market are encouraging too, with payrolled employment rising by 160,000 in October and vacancy levels hitting a record 1.17 million. But, Resolution also warns that pay could be a problem, as inflation threatens to rise faster than wages.Nye Cominetti, Senior Economist at the Resolution Foundation, said:“The furlough scheme has kept a lid on unemployment throughout the pandemic but many have feared that its closure on 30 September would spark a fresh labour market shock.“But early indications are that the UK’s jobs market has remained resilient, with record vacancies and job moves, and withstood the withdrawal of emergency support well.“But while unemployment is unlikely to be a problem this winter, pay may well be. The economy needs ‘goldilocks’ pay growth – fast enough to protect living standards, but not so fast as to generate excessive inflation.”They’ve written a handy thread on the jobs data:There’s ‘no sign of weakness’ in the UK’s labour market in the run-up to the end of the furlough scheme in September, says Paul Dales of Capital Economics.And if next month’s unemployment report shows a similar picture, the Bank of England is likely to raise interest rates at its December meeting.Dales explains: The first of the two labour market releases before the Bank of England’s 16th December policy meeting suggested that the labour market remained tight after the end of the furlough scheme. That supports our view that the Bank will raise interest rates in December.The further 14,900 fall in the claimant count in October and the 160,000 increase in the HMRC payroll measure of employment in October suggest that only a small share of the 1.1m people that were still on furlough on the last day of the scheme on 30th September lost their jobs. What’s more, the further rise in the number of vacancies from 1.108m to a record high of 1.172m in the three months to October suggests that the labour market remained tight.The number of insecure jobs, such as zero-hours contract, has also risen as the economy reopens, warns Ben Harrison, Director of the Work Foundation:“This month’s labour market statistics show early indications of recovery following the end of the furlough scheme, with PAYE data suggesting that there were 160,000 more individuals in work in October than September 2021. “With the unemployment rate decreasing slightly and the inactivity rate holding constant over the last quarter, this is a positive early sign that the economy is recovering from the worst effects of the pandemic. “Vacancies continued to rise to a new record of 1.17 million, an increase of 388,000 from the pre-pandemic January to March 2020 level. Nevertheless, with economic inactivity levels remaining high, there would be value in targeted employment support for people facing barriers in accessing work. However, these increases in employment are in part driven by growth in more insecure forms of work, including part time and zero hours contracts. If the Government is serious in its ambition to level up the economy, it must improve the quality of jobs being created to ensure reforms to the Further Education system break down barriers to lifelong learning.”The pound has rallied as this morning’s jobs report bolsters the prospect of a rise in UK interest rates.Sterling has gained almost half a cent to $1.346, its highest level in nearly a week.Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, explains:We are seeing the number of employees on companies’ books at a record high, despite the end of the furlough scheme while job vacancies are also at all-time highs. On the plus side, there are plenty of job opportunities, which are set to rise in the run up to festive season, very low redundancy levels and the headline unemployment figure on a downward trajectory.However the downside is that there are not enough workers, with fewer overseas job-seekers after the pandemic, skills shortages and supply is struggling to keep up with demand amid a faster-than-expected post-covid recovery. The tighter labour market is contributing towards an unsettling inflationary environment.By holding off from raising rates this month, it was clear the Bank of England wanted to see more data before jumping the gun with today’s employment figures helping to paint a clearer picture. Wages saw the smallest gain in five months but were still above expectations, pointing to ongoing price pressures. The central bank governor Andrew Bailey  which today’s data largely appears to confirm.The pound enjoyed a boost, thanks to the headline unemployment figure, which fell to 4.3%, just 0.3 percentage points above pre-pandemic levels, and ahead of analysts’ expectations, raising expectations of a rate hike sooner rather than later. GBPUSD has pushed back above $1.345, going against the downtrend that has been in play since the June peak, with losses having accelerated in recent weeks.Estimating pay growth during the pandemic is difficult -- but earnings growth does seem to have cooled.The ONS reports that total pay grew by 5.8% per year in July-September, down from 7.2% a month earlier.Regular pay, excluding bonuses, rose by 4.9%, down from 6.0% in June-August.Average total pay growth for the private sector was 6.6% in July to September, sharply ahead of the public sector where it was 2.4%.But...these figures have been distorted by the impact of falling wages early in the pandemic, and by the loss of more low-paid jobs as sectors such as hospitality were hit hardest (which lifts average pay levels).The ONS estimates that underlying regular pay growth could be as low as 3.4%, but says that this should be interpreted with caution given the uncertainty.If pay growth is just 3.4%, then that’s barely ahead of . Inflation is forecast to have jumped to around 3.9% in October (we find out tomorrow morning....).And with inflation likely to hit 5% next April, it suggests workers could face a real wage squeeze, rather than the ‘high-wage’ economy promised by the PM. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says: “The furlough scheme is a union success story, and it’s good news that so far, the wind down of the scheme has not been accompanied by job losses. “But if ministers are serious about a high wage economy, they have work to do. The last 12 years have been the worst period for wage growth since Napoleonic times. “And today’s figures suggest workers will be waiting for some time for the pay surge the prime minister promised at the Conservative party conference. Real pay is less than £2 a week above the pre-2008 financial crisis peak. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, says the UK government’s efforts to protect jobs through the pandemic have ‘largely paid off’:“Although this data relates to September, the final month of the furlough scheme, there is nothing here to give the Bank of England pause for concern when deciding whether to raise interest rates in response to rising expectations of inflation.“In particular, the number of people reporting in the Labour Force Survey at the end of September that they are ‘temporarily away from work’, a category that includes furlough, appears to be settling near its pre-pandemic level of around 2.5m people, and 7.5% of the total number of people in employment. This suggests that any remaining people receiving furlough payments from one employer are likely to be working elsewhere.“This is good news, and shows that the government’s policy to support jobs while the economy recovered has largely paid off.”The BBC’s economics editor Faisal Islam agrees that the furlough scheme does appear to have achieved its goals:At just 4.3%, the UK’s unemployment rate is much lower than economists feared early in the pandemic.Rushi Sunak, the chancellor of the exchequer, says it shows the success of the job retention scheme introduced back in spring 2020, which guaranteed most of the wages of workers temporarily sidelined.“Today’s numbers are testament to the extraordinary success of the furlough scheme and welcome evidence that our Plan for Jobs has worked. “We know how vital keeping people in good jobs is, both for them and for our economy – which is why it’s fantastic to see the unemployment rate falling for 9 months in a row and record numbers of people moving into employment.“Our Plan for Jobs is at the heart of our vision for a stronger economy for the British people, with schemes like Kickstart and Sector Based Work Academies continuing to create opportunities for people up and down the country.”The drop in unemployment also reflects the , swiftly developed and rolled out, which have allowed companies to reopen and take on more staff.This morning’s jobs report could encourage , says the FT’s Chris Giles:...ITV’s Joel Hills says the ‘early evidence’ suggests that most workers who were furloughed at the end of the scheme have remained in work: Reuters David Milliken says it’s an upbeat set of data:The jobs report also shows that workers switched jobs at a record pace over the summer.The increase in employment in July-September was driven by a record high net flow from unemployment to employment, the ONS reports.Total job-to-job moves also increased to a record high of 979,000, “largely driven by resignations rather than dismissals”, during the quarter, explains.That could be a sign that more workers are choosing to change jobs - . Or that the backlog in job moves caused by Covid-19 is clearing.The ONS also reports that the number of people in part-time work rose during the July-September quarter. There was also a rise in the number of people on zero-hour contracts, driven by young people.Hers are full details of the record vacancies at UK firms:The ONS also points out that the ratio of unemployed people to vacancies hit a record low of 1.3 in July-September, showing a very tight labour market.And although the growth rate slowed in the quarter, all industries increased their vacancy numbers on the quarter.The fastest rates of growth in vacancies compared with last quarter were seen in construction (41.1%) and transport and storage (40.4%) (where supply chains have been struggling due to a lack of qualified lorry drivers).Redundancies rose slightly in the three months to September, for the second month running, but were similar to pre-pandemic levels, the ONS says:The redundancy rate increased by 0.2 per thousand on the quarter (the last three months of the furlough scheme), to 3.7 per thousand employees:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Unemployment across the UK has fallen again, as companies continue to add workers to their payrolls despite the end of the furlough scheme in September.The UK’s jobless rate fell to 4.3% in the three months to September, new data from the Office for National Statistics shows, with the unemployment total dropping by around 152,000 compared to the previous quarter, to 1.448m. as firms continue to recruit as they recover from the economic shock of Covid-19 -- although it’s still higher than before the pandemic.In September alone, the unemployment rate is estimated to have dropped to just 3.9%.The furlough job-protection scheme ended on 30th September, and today’s report shows that companies continued to expand their workforces last month. The ONS estimates that there were 29.3 million employees on company payrolls in October, an increase of 160,000 compared with September.The ONS says:It is possible that those made redundant at the end of the furlough scheme will be included in the RTI data for a few further months, while they work out their notice period.However, responses to our business survey suggest that the numbers made redundant was likely to be a small share of those still on furlough at the end of September 2021.The number of people in work also rose, by around 247,000 to 32.523m, lifting the employment rate to 75.4%.The ONS explains:July to September 2021 estimates show a continuing recovery in the labour market, with a quarterly increase in the employment rate, while the unemployment rate decreased, and the economic inactivity rate was largely unchanged.Total hours worked increased, following the the relaxation of many coronavirus (COVID-19) restrictions. But the UK economic inactivity rate was estimated at 21.1%, 0.9 percentage points higher than before the pandemic, but largely unchanged on the quarter.Vacancies at UK companies hit a record level too in August to October, rising to 1,172,000.That’s an increase of 388,000 from the pre-coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic January to March 2020 level, with 15 of the 18 industry sectors showing record highs.Yesterday, the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told MPs he was “very uneasy” about the rising cost of living, but wanted to see post-furlough employment data before voting to raise interest rates. This jobs data could encourage some Bank policymakers to consider a rate rise at the next meeting, in December....It looks like a quiet start to trading in the markets, with the UK’s FTSE 100 seen a little lower, and .The latest monthly oil market report, updated eurozone growth figures, and new US retail sales figures could give new insights into the economic picture.Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says:Retail sales numbers in the US have been quite difficult to predict in recent months, with consumer confidence coming under pressure, due to rising prices in the shops and at the fuel pumps. In September US retail sales came in better than expected, rising 0.7%, against a forecast of -0.2%, while the August numbers were revised up to 0.9%. These better-than-forecasted numbers, along with the continued improvement in the US labour market helped convince the Federal Reserve that the economy was strong enough for it to proceed with its plans to start tapering its monthly asset purchase program starting this month.It is certainly true that the US consumer has been more resilient than consumer confidence numbers might suggest in recent months. We’ve come off two successive monthly gains since the -1.8% decline seen in July, and today’s October numbers are expected to see another gain of 1.3%. While this might chime with how well a lot of US retailers have been doing this past quarter, it is completely at odds with the direction of recent consumer confidence data, which has been weak.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2eaf0ff4376a90d9f9e06841e2f0a9b2f7f80a12/0_0_635_492/master/635.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ef66c4eebadba6e8e34ee682ef2cd7c7
"Major Alzheimer's breakthrough as new study uncovers jab that can reduce memory loss - Liverpool Echo
A scientific study has uncovered a new approach to treat Alzheimer's. Experiments on mice have found an antibody-based treatment and protein-based vaccine can help reduce symptoms of the disease. Both products target a highly toxic protein in the brain - instead of focusing on the amyloid beta protein in plaques in the brain, which is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease.READ MORE:The work is a collaboration between researchers at Britain and German scientists with the medical research charity LifeArc. Professor Thomas Bayer, from the University Medical Centre Gottingen, said: ""In clinical trials, none of the potential treatments which dissolve amyloid plaques in the brain have shown much success in terms of reducing Alzheimer's symptoms. ""Some have even shown negative side effects. So we decided on a different approach.He added: ""We identified an antibody in mice that would neutralise the truncated forms of soluble amyloid beta, but would not bind either to normal forms of the protein or to the plaques.""This antibody was adapted by Dr Preeti Bakrania and colleagues from LifeArc so a human immune system would accept it. Leicester researchers were surprised when they found how and where this humanised antibody, called TAP01-04, was binding to the shortened form of amyloid beta. They saw the amyloid beta protein was folded back on itself, in a hairpin-shaped structure.Professor Mark Carr, from the Leicester Institute of Structural and Chemical Biology at the University of Leicester, explained: ""This structure had never been seen before in amyloid beta.""However, discovering such a definite structure allowed the team to engineer this region of the protein to stabilise the hairpin shape and bind to the antibody in the same way.""Our idea was that this engineered form of amyloid beta could potentially be used as a vaccine, to trigger someone's immune system to make TAP01-04 type antibodies."" When the engineered amyloid beta protein was tested in mice, they found the animals that received this ""vaccine"" did produce TAP01 type antibodies. This antibody and the engineered amyloid beta vaccine, called TAPAS, were then tested in two different mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.Based on imaging techniques similar to those used to diagnose Alzheimer's in humans, researchers found that both the antibody and the vaccine helped to restore neuron function.According to the study, they also helped to increase glucose metabolism in the brain, restore memory loss, and while they were not directly targeted, they even reduced the formation of amyloid beta plaque.LifeArc's Dr Bakrania said: ""The TAP01-04 humanised antibody and the TAPAS vaccine are very different to previous antibodies or vaccines for Alzheimer's disease that have been tested in clinical trials, because they target a different form of the protein.""This makes them really promising as a potential treatment for the disease either as a therapeutic antibody or a vaccine.""The results so far are very exciting and testament to the scientific expertise of the team. ""If the treatment does prove successful, it could transform the lives of many patients."" Prof Carr added: ""While the science is currently still at an early stage, if these results were to be replicated in human clinical trials, then it could be transformative.""It opens up the possibility to not only treat Alzheimer's once symptoms are detected, but also to potentially vaccinate against the disease before symptoms appear.""The researchers are now looking to find a commercial partner to take the therapeutic antibody and the vaccine through clinical trials.The findings are published in Molecular Psychiatry.

A Covid-19 vaccine administered through a skin patch covered in tiny needles could be on its way as the British invention enters the clinical trial stage.Emergex, a company from Oxfordshire, have created the patch, which is said to be more long-lasting than regular Covid vaccinations.The company hopes that their patch will trigger a response that kills T cells, which could prevent the virus from even spreading.Chief executive officer of Emergex and emeritus professor of molecular medicine at UCL Thomas Rademacher said: ""Our T cell priming vaccine for Covid has been specifically designed to stimulate a T cell response to kill viral infected cells before they become factories for the virus.""The preclinical data we have suggests that our vaccine will elicit a strong T cell response similar to the longer lasting immune response that is found after many natural viral infections.""Our vaccine is targeted to generate an immune response against highly conserved internal parts of the virus and potentially protect us against current and new variants and related strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-1.""The Emergex vaccine contains an antigen only found on the surface of infected cells.This stimulates the immune system to activate a specific T cell that searches for cells with this protein on their surface and, when found, it hits the 'kill switch' and destroys it.The vaccine is entering stage one clinical trials, which will see it administered to 26 people in Lausanne, Switzerland.If successful, it could be available by 2025.Other companies are also developing Covid vaccines that are given through skin patches.In Australia, researchers are also testing one that contains 5,000 microneedles.

In 2014, James Blunt spent the summer travelling the world in a space suit. The “You’re Beautiful” singer was on tour promoting Moon Landing, his fourth studio album and a project Rolling Stone described as “emotionally lopsided” and bedevilled by the singer’s “agitated whimper”.Wimpers aside, under the spotlight, Blunt arrived with a bang. In a droll nod to the LP title, he and his band performed as astronauts in Nasa flight suits (minus the helmet, which would have rendered him inaudible – a plus or minus depending on your opinion of his music). During the show, he would sometimes explain “moon landing” referred not to space travel but to what happened when two people sharing a dressing room bent over at the same time so that their bums touched.You could see Blunt’s tactic: to steam-roll any naysayers in the building with wit and self-mockery. It was an ingenious strategy – but by no means unique to Blunt. Along with fellow arena chest-thumpers Josh Groban and Michael Bublé, and show-off guitarist John Mayer, he’s part of a generation of cheesy artists who have mastered the art of ironic naffness. He’s having his cake while also winking and letting the haters know cakes are silly and that’s he’s entirely in on the joke.The approach has worked miracles for all these headliners. The more they clown about in between songs and on social media, the more inclined the world at large is to give their music a free pass. In Blunt’s case, especially, the transformation has been remarkable. The wavy haired crooner, who releases his career retrospective The Stars Beneath My Feet (2004-2021) on Friday, was once the most hated man in pop. The former army reconnaissance officer had staged a full-frontal charge on the charts in 2005 with “You’re Beautiful”. That tune was inspired by a chance encounter with an old girlfriend on the Tube: she was with her new partner and Blunt watched them from afar before running home to alchemise his heartache through music. It topped the charts in 10 countries. In the UK, it spent five weeks at number one. And it turned Blunt into Britain’s number-one punch bag.The case against him wasn’t merely that he was soppy. It was that the Harrow old boy and former member of the Household Cavalry Regiment was soppy and posh. And to be heartfelt and blue-blooded was a double infraction against which there was no comeback. Or, as the NME put it, Blunt was “boring-but-inexplicably popular”. The same publication named Blunt’s debut, Back to Bedlam, the worst album of 2004.Seventeen years later, Blunt has reached the milestone of his first “best of” compilation. Yet, instead of a posh public enemy, he stands before us as a stealthy national treasure. He’s pop’s geezer number one. You might not want front-row tickets to one of Blunt’s concerts, but you may very well be amenable to having a pint with him. Blunt commands a sneaking regard even among those who’d happily never again listen to his music.How did this turnabout happen? The answer is that Blunt worked out you can get away with nearly anything in life – up to and including writing “You’re Beautiful” and going to Harrow – provided you’re funny and deprecating. Exhibit A in this regard is his Twitter account. Blunt has gone above and beyond in poking fun at himself. “I never liked the sound of my own voice. Till it made me rich,” he replied to one unkind tweet in 2013. “For Lent, I’ve given up music,” he wrote two years later. “There is a god”. In 2020, an anthology of his best tweets was published as How To Be A Complete and Utter Blunt. And last month, he plugged his new compilation by tweeting “Just when you though it was safe to go back outside”. This was accompanied by a short film in which a woman erupts in screams when confronted by Blunt walking down the road with his guitar and busker’s drum-kit.Does Blunt truly believe his music is a hellish stain upon humanity? Obviously not. However, in hinting he might possibly be in on the joke about his perceived naff qualities, he’s acquired the rock equivalent of a Get Out of Jail card. All musical sins are forgiven.He is one of that distinct sub-category of cornball male stars whose music is generally derided as syrup on a stick, but who have discovered that critical slings and arrows are easily dodged if you pretend you’re aware how terrible you are perceived to be. With a flash of wit or humility, a lifetime of brownie points are yours.James Blunt is far from the only artist to follow this strategyBlunt is indisputably the Olympic champion at performatively beating yourself up before the reviewers get to you. Still, it’s a crowded podium. Among those pushing him all the way are the aforementioned Josh Groban, Michael Bublé and John Mayer (not a crooner but someone whose guitar solos make you question the existence of God the way Blunt does when bearing down on the chorus of “You’re Beautiful”).Groban provides a particularly instructive example of a star who, in the normal course, could expect to be figuratively clapped in chains and pelted with fruit. Instead, he has reinvented himself through the art of self-mockery.He learnt the hard way his music was not going to be enough to win over the wider world. “Thin and insipid” was The Independent’s appraisal of his LP, All That Echoes. “A one-note songwriter,” said the BBC – not renowned for its critical maulings. The consensus was that Groban couldn’t have been any cheesier were he sprayed down with liquified Wensleydale.But Groban quickly revealed his super-power: that he was a hoot in concert. Contradicting his image as an overgrown choir boy, he would joke extravagantly about how sorry he felt for all the boyfriends and husbands dragged out against their will. On one tour he even hosted a Q&A session in which he vibed off the audience. He appeared to be having a lot more fun trading zingers than belting out his sub-Broadway takes on “It’s Now Or Never” and Robbie Williams’ “Angels”.Few would mistake Josh Groban for musically credible. And yet nobody could nowadays claim he was piously naffAll that riffing and quipping has had the desired result. Few would mistake Josh Groban for musically credible. And yet nobody could nowadays claim he was piously naff. The New York Times has praised his “inordinately charming stage presence, his cherubic features and tousled long locks”; Rolling Stone heralded him as “very funny on social media and talk shows”. He’s off the hook.His career has marched in lockstep with Blunt’s. Both broke through in the early 2000s. So it’s hard to tell if one has influenced the other in terms of image management. What is indisputable is that social media has been a godsend for both. In Groban’s case, the “coming out” ceremony as a good sport with a sense of humour happened in 2011 on Jimmy Kimmel Live! There, he “sang” a selection of Kanye West tweets in a “Grobnian” style. Later, he turned up in US sitcoms It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia and The Office, the latter after he was contacted by the show’s Mindy Kaling on Twitter. “Maybe there’s stigma to more classically infused music, that it’s older-skewing,” Groban confessed to Vulture in 2015 about this perceived squareness, “but the more I can get out to my age group and younger, it’s like, I’ve liked this stuff since I was your age – we’re all weird together.”Next we come to Michael Bublé, whose 2011 Christmas album has shifted 12 million copies worldwide, placing it in the top 25 best-selling records of the 21st century. As with Groban, his live shows are full of quips about how no man would willingly attend one of his concerts. And there will be joke after joke at his own expense – in addition to impersonations of the Pope and single entendre exchanges with his backing band that go on longer than his Sinatra covers.Bublé tends to keep to himself on social media (though he has discovered the joys of TikTok). On Twitter, Blunt’s greatest rival has historically been John Mayer. The musician is worshipped by guitarists for his flagellating technique. Among the wider public, he is better known for his brisk love life – he’s dated Katy Perry and Jennifer Aniston and was the inspiration for Taylor Swift’s “Dear John”. And for his colourful and often bizarre tweets. “Yogurt does nothing. Creamy nonsense,” he informed his 1.4 million followers in 2017. “Confession: while I’m annoyed by people who talk loudly/act obnoxiously in public, I secretly admire their lack of self consciousness,” he added several months later. Can you be any more in profound in 280 characters or fewer?Ironic naff to the max: John Mayer in a promo shot for his latest album Mayer recently took his playful trolling to the next level with an album of knowingly toe-curling 1980s “yacht rock” tributes called Sob Rock. It was his biggest hit in years, suggesting people prefer John Mayer, ironic joker, to John Mayer, preening rock god. James Blunt’s strategy of bantering with his detractors has, meanwhile, become so successful that he has ended up a victim of his own hilarity. After a few years of abusive Tweets coming his way, he noticed strangers were no longer taking potshots. He had “won” the internet. It was devastating. “The sadness is that people have stopped being abusive to me. I’ve got no material to work with,” Blunt lamented to the Guardian in 2013.Just last week he said he had learnt to turn online negativity to a plus. In a way, he’s cracked the unsolvable puzzle. He’s worked out how to beat the internet at its own game. “I’ve learned to cash in on it,” he told PA. “It’s a joke, because I go on tours around the world and I am lucky enough to play arenas of up to 20,000 people a night.”A cosmos without James Blunt torching randomers on Twitter is one that is so much poorer. Yet the disappearance of the haters also highlights Blunt’s success. Not even online vitriol – the most toxic substance known to mankind – can withstand the forcefield projected by a kitschy singer with a sense of humour.Blunt is a past master of the tear-streaked power ballad. But as he proved when he strapped himself into a space suit all those years ago, what is truly out of this world is his ability to weave hate into comedy gold.‘The Stars Beneath My Feet (2004- 2021)’ is released on 19 NovemberTo be perfectly blunt: the singer has turned online hate into comedy gold on Twitter James Blunt is far from the only artist to follow this strategyIronic naff to the max: John Mayer in a promo shot for his latest album Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

"Leonid meteor shower to light up skies this week - here's when and where's best to see it - Sky News
A spectacular shooting star display is set to illuminate the night sky as the annual Leonid meteor shower returns.Astronomers say Wednesday night pre-dawn will offer the best chance of catching a glimpse of the light show.The Leonids, usually one of the more ""prolific"" showers with fast, bright meteors, are commonly associated with the Tempel-Tuttle comet.Displays are better when the comet, which takes 33 years to orbit the sun, is nearer to Earth - however, stargazers must wait 15 years for the next occurrence.As for this week, people living in the south are expected to have the best opportunity to view the display, as it's forecast to be largely dry with variable cloud between Wednesday and Friday.Unfortunately for those in the north, the Met Office has predicted changeable weather with spells of rain or showers and wind.The Royal Museums Greenwich Group, which includes the Royal Observatory, advises stargazers on its website: ""Hunting for meteors, like the rest of astronomy, is a waiting game, so it's best to bring a comfy chair to sit on and wrap up warm as you could be outside for a while.""They can be seen with the naked eye, so there's no need for binoculars or a telescope, though you will need to allow your eyes to adjust to the dark.""For the best conditions, find a safe location away from street lights and other sources of light pollution.""The Leonids appear to stream from the head of constellation Leo the Lion, which they were named after.The comet leaves behind a tiny path of debris as it follows its path around the sun.This enters Earth's atmosphere at speeds of up to 70km per second - vaporising and creating the incredible streaks of light known as meteors.Showers will peak on Wednesday but are expected to be present for several days before and after, although at a lower rate.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/11/768x432/skynews-leonid-meteor-shower_5583957.jpg?20211115150433,"Diamond hauled from deep inside Earth holds never-before-seen mineral - Space.com
Within a diamond hauled from deep beneath Earth's surface, scientists have discovered the first example of a never-before-seen mineral.Named davemaoite after prominent geophysicist Ho-kwang (Dave) Mao, the mineral is the first example of a high-pressure calcium silicate perovskite (CaSiO3) found on Earth. Another form of CaSiO3, known as wollastonite, is commonly found across the globe, but davemaoite has a crystalline structure that forms only under high pressure and high temperatures in Earth's mantle, the mainly solid layer of Earth trapped between the outer core and the crust.Davemaoite has long been expected to be an abundant and geochemically important mineral in Earth's mantle. But scientists have never found any direct evidence of its existence because it breaks down into other minerals when it moves toward the surface and pressure decreases. However, analysis of a diamond from Botswana, which formed in the mantle around 410 miles (660 kilometers) below Earth's surface, has revealed a sample of intact davemaoite trapped inside. As a result, the International Mineralogical Association has now confirmed davemaoite as a new mineral.Related: ""The discovery of davemaoite came as a surprise,"" lead author Oliver Tschauner, a mineralogist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told Live Science. Tschauner and his colleagues uncovered the davemaoite sample with a technique known as synchrotron X-ray diffraction, which focuses a high-energy beam of X-rays on certain spots within the diamond with microscopic precision. By measuring the angle and intensity of the returning light, researchers can decipher what's inside, Tschauner said. The sample of davemaoite within the diamond was just a few micrometers (millionths of a meter) in size, so less-powerful sampling techniques would have missed it, he added.Davemaoite is believed to play an important geochemical role in Earth's mantle. Scientists theorize that the mineral may also contain other trace elements, including uranium and thorium, which release heat via radioactive decay. Therefore, davemaoite may help to generate a substantial amount of heat in the mantle, Tschauner said.In a 2014 study published in the journal Science, researchers described another theoretical high-pressure mineral from the mantle, known as bridgmanite. However, the sample of bridgmanite did not originate from the mantle but rather inside a meteorite. The discovery of davemaoite shows that diamonds can form farther down in the mantle than previously thought, and it suggests that they might be the best place to look for more new minerals from the mantle, Tschauner said.———""The work by Tschauner et al. inspires hope in the discovery of other difficult high-pressure phases in nature,"" Yingwei Fe, a geophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the study, said in a related Science article. ""Such direct sampling of the inaccessible lower mantle would fill our knowledge gap in chemical composition of the entire mantle of our planet.""The study was published online Nov. 11 in the journal Science.Originally published on Live Science. to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

It might be hotter than lava but superionic ice is not on fire. Image Credit: Stewart Scott/Shutterstock.comIf you think of very low temperatures, there's a good chance you are picturing ice. Ice is a quintessential ""cold"" thing for us. But at extreme pressures, like in the core of large planets, something peculiar can happen. Ice can remain solid but have a temperature hotter than the surface of the Sun.This type of water ice is called ""superionic ice"" and has been added to the list of around 20 phases water can structurally form, including ice, liquid, and vapor. Now, researchers report in Nature Physics the discovery and characterization of two superionic ice phases, having found a way of reliably and stably recreating the ice for longer than has previously been achieved to be able to study it. One superionic phase extends between 200,000 and 600,00 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level and at a temperature of several hundred to over 1,000°C. The other phase extends to half the pressure experienced at the center of the Earth and with temperatures of thousands of degrees.“It was a surprise — everyone thought this phase wouldn’t appear until you are at much higher pressures than where we first find it,” co-author Vitali Prakapenka, a University of Chicago research professor and beamline scientist at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory, said in a statement. “But we were able to very accurately map the properties of this new ice, which constitutes a new phase of matter, thanks to several powerful tools.”At higher temperatures and incredible pressures, the ice remains solid but the atomic structure is dramatically shifted. Once the pressure and temperature are removed though, the ice return to its regular state.“Imagine a cube, a lattice with oxygen atoms at the corners connected by hydrogen,” Prakapenka said. “When it transforms into this new superionic phase, the lattice expands, allowing the hydrogen atoms to migrate around while the oxygen atoms remain steady in their positions. It’s kind of like a solid oxygen lattice sitting in an ocean of floating hydrogen atoms.”Superionic ice is less dense than regular ice, which we know already to be less dense than liquid water. It also changes color. While water ice can be transparent to cloudy white, depending on how it freezes, superionic ice is darker as it interacts with light differently.“It’s a new state of matter, so it basically acts as a new material, and it may be different from what we thought,” Prakapenka said.Planetary scientists believe similar extreme conditions in pressure and temperatures might exist inside Neptune and Uranus, as well as other ice giant planets beyond the Solar System. Understanding the properties of superionic ice might help us understand the properties of these planets.This website uses cookiesThis website uses cookies to improve user experience.

"Halo Infinite multiplayer is available to play right now - Techradar
Spartan season begins today: Season 1 of the hotly anticipated multiplayer game Halo Infinite is available ... right now. Tom French, Multiplayer Associate Creative Director for Halo Infinite, made the announcement during the  on November 15.""On behalf of the entire Halo team,"" French said, ""it's my honor and privilege to announce that your Spartan journey begins today. Right now you can download and start playing Season 1 of Halo Infinite's free-to-play multiplayer beta on Xbox One, Series S, [Series] X, and PC.""This is the kick off of our season and you'll have access to all the maps, core modes, academy features, and the full Battle Pass to unlock, and your progression will carry over when we officially release the game on December 8.""Described by developer 343 Industries as a spiritual reboot of the series, Halo Infinite's campaign mode will continue the ongoing story of the franchise, and Xbox Series X players will enjoy ""up to 4k resolution at 60fps in the campaign and greatly reduced load times creating seamless gameplay that ushers in the next generation of gaming"".The multiplayer mode saw a couple of initial beta previews earlier this year, with the most recent being just last month. Multiplayer mode will also see the return of split-screen co-op, which was cut from Halo 5 in favor of an online only multiplayer mode – a creative decision that caused considerable controversy among the Halo fanbase.Bonnie Ross, head of 343 Industries said in 2017 that the removal of split-screen co-op from Halo 5 was ""painful"" and that ""it erodes trust with the community. [We’ve had a] lot of learnings from that, and I would say for any FPS going out forward we will always have split-screen going forward.""There are plenty of Halo multiplayer diehards out there, and Halo Infinite definitely aims squarely at the fanbase. But there's plenty of reason to think that this entry in the series could bring in new players who might not have gotten into past entries.For one thing, cross-progression between Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC should make it easier for everyone to play with their friends, while a Day One release on Xbox Game Pass could easily rope in a lot of potential players who might not have given it a look otherwise.Being free-to-play definitely doesn't hurt. But given the popularity of a host of other free-to-play multiplayer shooters like Apex Legends, Fortnite, and Call of Duty Warzone, Halo Infinite has a lot more competition than it did when the first Halo game debuted 20 years ago.John (He / Him / His) is TechRadar's Computing Staff Writer and is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY. Named by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.You can find him online on Twitter at @thisdotjohnCurrently playing: Back 4 Blood, Metroid Dread, EVE OnlineThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

This is not the type of news you want to hear on a Monday. I suppose it’s the right day of the week for it, though. While I don’t share in the collective ire directed at the first working day of the week that many people seem to feel, it goes without saying that Monday’s are simply the worst. And this news today makes me really dislike this particular Monday more than most, because it would seem that we might have to say goodbye to dreams of a folding Pixel phone. At least for now.Ross Young@DSCCRossBad news for those waiting for the Google Pixel Fold. We hear they have canceled parts orders and decided not to bring it to market as indicated in the latest DSCC Weekly Review.

Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is a flawed but nevertheless fascinating look at the angsty years of the great detective. Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is your chance to roleplay as the famous detective, running around the fictional, multicultural island of Cordona as an angst-ridden youngster. You'll solve murders, track down stolen property, fight bandits, and wear more costumes than Lady Gaga on tour. When Chapter One is bad it's really bad, but like the handsome Sherry himself, you can't help forgive it when it gets weird, then flashes you a handsome smile.  Release Date: November 16
Platform(s): PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PC
Developer: Frogwares
Publisher: Frogwares  As you'd hope, once you've arrived in Cordona with your mysterious, bossy companion Jon, you barely have time to buy a souvenir fridge magnet before you're working on a case. Cases range from sprawling investigations tied to the main storyline, to smaller mysteries that focus on one location. The best part is absolutely working your way through the bigger cases, using Sherlock's full skill set to do so. Searching the crime scene for every last piece of evidence, dressing in disguises (purchased from various vendors) to win the confidence of sailors, workers, bandits, or vagabonds, and searching the archives of the local paper or city hall for relevant clues. Sherlock can also focus his concentration to see the likely path of a suspect, or do quick chemical analysis (a math-based logic puzzle that - thankfully - you can skip without incurring any sort of penalty) on mysterious substances and observe suspects and witnesses to glean clues from their clothes and demeanor. It's this set of gameplay mechanics that really are what keep people coming back to the Frogwares series, a chance to play pretend from inside the mind of a genius, to feel like a bit of the Sherlock cerebral superpowers have rubbed off on them.  The real mystery at the heart of the whole game is the root of Sherlock's psychological trauma, one that is slowly revealed through the medium of... shopping. Now, we've hit all headed to Amazon while in the grip of depression and boxed wine, but I did not expect the world's greatest detective to need to purchase a bunch of paintings before he could figure out why he has mental health issues. Sherlock will also encounter different memories as you refurbish the family home, and as you search around Cordona.At first, Cordona feels a little like an animated screensaver, something you just move past in order to get to the next destination, but the game tries its best to keep you engaged with some side quests later on. A treasure hunt, Sherlock lore, even an overheard conversation that could trigger a case. Don't look too closely at the locals though, because terrifyingly, a lot of them appear to be clones. Perhaps this is a bigger part of a Sherlock-worthy mystery, but I suspect it has more to do with budget constraints. There are also bandit hideaways, which you can enter at any time to try your hand at some fisticuffs.  These action sequences - which you can trigger with the hideouts or will occasionally happen as part of a case - start out interesting, become tedious, and then sort of circle back to hilarious. You're thrown into a room that serves as an arena with a few objects that can be triggered to deal environmental damage that stuns enemies. Exploding canisters, bags of flour, valves, lamps, the Victorian equivalent of red barrels. Enemies also handily wear accessories that you can shoot at to stun them too, hats, armor, little vials of combustible substances. Stunning an enemy means you can arrest them after a simple QTE punch-up. Crucially, despite being equipped with a gun, you're not supposed to actually kill anyone, and Jon will berate you if you do. When you're shooting off a man's hat while he's moving, it's surprisingly easy to do. The sequences are too easy to clear once you get the hang of them, new enemies are funneled in a few at a time, and they start to drag on. Someone could have budgeted for a few more voice lines for these sequences too, prepare to hear ""I will end you"" and ""I didn't want to miss the party"" in indefinable accents at least 237 times. These whole sections could have been scrapped or reduced to just the optional bandit hideouts, and the game would have been better for it.  One of the more subjective struggles I had with the game was some of the more nuanced stories it attempts to handle. Despite an early disclaimer about the game being set in different times, there are few cases that hang on characters and twists that feel clumsy rather than capable. When you're racing through a case about a lovelorn, possibly homicidal elephant, you're suddenly hit with an awkward fumbling of issues of gender identity. A search for a controversial stolen painting becomes an investigation into a traumatic sexual assault. Add to that some of the more caricatured portraits of the diverse inhabitants of Cordona and it all just feels a bit old-fashioned, and not in a periodically appropriate way. Tackling difficult subjects in games is a worthy endeavor, but you need to make sure you're doing it right. Despite the issues, the moments of cringe, and the occasionally budget feel, developer Frogwares has carved itself a niche delivering Sherlock roleplay to the masses, and this will still scratch your investigative itch. It pulled me in and kept me intrigued - sucker as I am for pretty boys with an air of gothic melodrama about them, and I hope we get to see more of the hot and handsome young Sherlock soon.Sherlock Holmes Chapter One was played on a PS5 with a review code provided by the publisher. 3.5 out of 5Between Official PlayStation Magazine, GamesIndustry.biz and Rolling Stone I've picked up a wide range of experience, from how to handle the madness of E3 to making easy conversation with CEOs and executives of game companies over seafood buffets.

"Liverpool explosion: Everything we know so far about car blast at hospital - The Independent
The explosion in a taxi outside a Liverpool hospital has been declared a terrorist attack and the suspect killed in the blast has been named.Emad Al Swealmeen died after a homemade bomb exploded in the vehicle outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital shortly before 11am on Remembrance Sunday.The 32-year-old, known to friends in the UK as Enzo Almeni, was the sole passenger. The driver of the taxi, named locally as David Perry, was injured but managed to escape and has since been released from hospital.Four men - aged 20, 21, 26 and 29 - believed to be “associates” of the taxi passenger have been arrested in the Kensington area of the city.The explosion has been declared a terrorist incident by police but the motivation for the attack is “yet to be understood”.Counter-terrorism police are now leading the investigation into the incident, aided by the security service, MI5.Police were called at 10.59am on Sunday 14 November to reports of a car explosion outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital.A taxi carrying one passenger had exploded as it pulled up outside.Emergency services were on the scene within minutes and one man, the passenger in the taxi, was pronounced dead.The driver, identified locally as David Perry, was injured but managed to escape from the vehicle and has since been discharged from hospital.He picked up the passenger in the Rutland Avenue area of Liverpool, roughly a 10-minute drive from Liverpool Women’s Hospital, according to Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, from Counter Terrorism Policing North West.The hospital was a short walk from the city’s cathedral, which was hosting a large Remembrance Sunday service attended by more than 2,000 people who were about to observe the traditional two-minute silence at 11am.Emergency services at the scene of the blast outside Liverpool Women’s HospitalBig screens had been set up in the grounds of the cathedral so people who were not able to get into the service could watch it outside. Local roads had also been closed for a parade linked to the event.Officers said an explosion came from within the car as it approached the drop-off point.A video has emerged showing the taxi driving up to the front of Liverpool Women’s Hospital. It shows a blast going off inside the car, forcing it to stop, and white smoke then billowing from the windows.The driver can be seen opening the right-hand car door and running away before the vehicle bursts into flames.Police, firefighters and a bomb disposal unit all attended the scene.Phil Garrigan, chief fire officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, said the fire was “fully developed” when fire engines arrived shortly after 11am.The suspect who died in the explosion has been named by counter-terror police as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen, also known as Enzo Almeni.He is understood to be of Middle Eastern origin and reportedly settled in Britain several years ago.According to reports, Al Swealmeen converted to Christianity after moving to the UK from the Middle East and had been supported by a Christian couple who at one stage housed him in Liverpool.He is not thought to have been previously known to the security services.Malcolm Hitchcott, who with his wife Elizabeth had taken Al Swealmeen in to live with them, said the suspect had first come to Liverpool’s Anglican Cathedral in 2015 and wanted to convert from Islam to Christianity.He told The Sun: “He was destitute at that time and we took him in. The UK asylum people were never convinced he was Syrian and he was refused asylum in 2014.“He had his case rejected because he has been sectioned due to some mental health incident where he was waving a knife at people from an overpass.”He was reported to have converted to Christianity at the city’s Anglican Cathedral in 2017.A police cordon at Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, where suspected attacker Emad Al Swealmeen once lived at a rental property Ms Hitchcott told ITV there was “never any suggestion of anything amiss” during the eight months Al Swealmeen lived with the couple.Speaking to the BBC, she said: “We’re just so, so sad. We just loved him, he was a lovely guy.” Asked if the couple was shocked by the incident, she added: “Very.”The suspect, described as artistic and a motor racing fan by the couple, was reported to have changed his name to the Italian name Enzo – after the renowned racing driver Enzo Ferrari.The Sun reported he was a Jordanian national who had spent time in Iraq, where his mother was from, however this has not been officially confirmed.Four men in their 20s were arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act in the Kensington area of Liverpool following the incident.Three of the men - aged 21, 26 and 29 - were on Sunday night arrested in Sutcliffe Street, where witnesses described seeing armed officers approach a terraced house only a few hours after the hospital blast.A fourth man, aged 20, was also detained in the same area of the city on Monday.An armed police officer holds a breaching shotgun, used to blast the hinges off a door, at an address in Rutland Avenue in Sefton ParkAll four have since been released from police custody following interviews.Two addresses, one in Sutcliffe Street and another in Rutland Avenue, have been searched, with the second address yielding “significant items”, according to counter-terrorism police.Police believe Al Swealmeen lived at the Sutcliffe Street address for some time and had recently rented the Rutland Avenue address.Eight families were evacuated from near the Rutland Avenue address and a cordon put in place.Officers carried out a controlled explosion as a precautionary measure at Sefton Park, but there is not believed to be any wider risk to the public as the investigation continues.The explosion was declared a terror incident by police on Monday morning, a day after the blast.The UK terror threat level has since been raised from substantial to severe, meaning an attack is “highly likely” rather than “likely”.Officers from Counter Terrorism North West are leading the investigation, supported by Merseyside Police and the security service, MI5.Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West Russ Jackson speaks during a press conference at Merseyside Police Headquarters in LiverpoolDetectives are unsure what the motivation behind the attack was, the reason for the device’s “sudden explosion” or why Al Swealmeen asked to be taken to the hospital.Police said it could take “many weeks” before they fully understand what happened in terms of planning, preparation and how things unfolded.Prime minister Boris Johnson chaired an emergency Cobra meeting on Monday afternoon in light of the events.Nick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said: “From what I’ve seen there is very little blast damage, there is a lot of fire damage, but very little blast damage.“So whatever was in there is probably a low yield or didn’t work properly or possibly an incendiary.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the taxi driver for acting with “incredible presence of mind and bravery”, while mayor of Liverpool Joanne Anderson lauded the driver for his “heroic efforts”.The driver, named locally as David Perry, was injured during the explosion but has since been discharged from hospital.Reports have claimed he locked the passenger in the vehicle to contain the incident, however subsequent CCTV shows the blast had already happened as the vehicle drew to a halt.His wife, Rachel Perry, said her husband’s escape from serious injury was an “utter miracle” and appeared to debunk the claims that he locked the passenger in the car.She said: “There are a lot of rumours flying round about him being a hero and locking the passenger inside the car.“The truth of the matter is, he is without doubt, lucky to be alive.”Liverpool’s Mayor, Joanne Anderson, said: “The taxi driver, in his heroic efforts, has managed to divert what could have been an absolutely awful disaster at the hospital.She added: “Well, we knew that the taxi driver had stood out and locked the doors, we knew that early on.”Additional reporting by PAThe explosion in a taxi outside Liverpool Women’s Hospital has been declared a terrorist attack and the suspect killed in the blast has been namedEmergency services at the scene of the blast outside Liverpool Women’s HospitalA police cordon at Rutland Avenue, Liverpool, where suspected attacker Emad Al Swealmeen once lived at a rental property An armed police officer holds a breaching shotgun, used to blast the hinges off a door, at an address in Rutland Avenue in Sefton ParkHead of Counter Terrorism Policing North West Russ Jackson speaks during a press conference at Merseyside Police Headquarters in LiverpoolWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Conservative MPs have demanded one of their colleagues should retire after he blocked a late-night motion that would have overturned the controversial Owen Paterson vote. Christopher Chope, the MP for Christchurch, blocked a motion rescinding the Leadsom Amendment that would have saved Mr Paterson from a six-week suspension while setting up a new standards committee and appeals process. MPs will now debate the issue for an hour today. Mr Chope is a long-time objector to bills going through on the nod, having blocked the upskirting bill and a law banning FGM on the same basis.  This morning fellow backbenchers told The Telegraph the mood towards their colleague was ""venomous"", with several suggesting he should quit or risk being deselected. One said: ""He should have retired years ago."" Another described him as ""a dinosaur"" and ""disgraced granddad"".Another said: ""His rationale [for objecting] is not widely followed by the public - it's really not helpful. The problem is, it's a matter for his electorate (like with second jobs) as to whether he is representing them or not.""But the move has provoked some hubris among opposition MPs. Thangam Debbonaire, shadow Commons leader, said it was a ""farce of the Tories’ own making and serves Boris Johnson right for trying to sneak a U-turn out at night rather than do the decent thing and come to the House to apologise for the Tory sleaze scandal"".   ​​Follow the latest updates below.Lord Hague has said there had been a ""cultural shift"" in terms of acceptable behaviour. The former leader of the Conservative Party told Times Radio: ""What we're seeing, of course, is people being caught out, as it were, and being named and shamed for things they did in the context of a past culture.""Now standards are very, very different, so everybody better look out and be aware that standards are very different.""William Hague has said allegations against Stanley Johnson should be treated ""in the same way"" as other harassment claims.Asked about the accusations made by Tory MP Caroline Nokes against the Prime Minister's father, the former Conservative leader told Times Radio: ""It's important for people in positions of authority who become aware of things to act. When I was in authority in the Conservative Party, I wasn't aware of anything like this. It is awful to hear these things.""Lord Hague added: ""It's very hard to rush to judgment, though, isn't it? Because we don't really know anything about the facts of this case.""So, it's very hard to comment on it other than that everybody should be treated equally in these things whether they're the Prime Minister's father or not, everybody should be regarded in the same way and open to the same scrutiny.""Azeem Rafiq, the Yorkshire County Cricket Club player, has been giving evidence to MPs of the DCMS committee about his experience of racism at the club. So far, his testimony has been highly emotional, requiring committee chair Julian Knight to call for a break after Mr Rafiq broke down in tears. Most appalling was when he recalled the 'inhuman' treatment of Yorkshire CCC after his wife's stillbirth.My colleagues are covering the session in full - read the updates here.The head of the NHS in England has urged people to ""help us"" by getting the Covid booster vaccination ahead of a ""really tough winter"".Amanda Pritchard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The best thing that the public could do to help us really is just to take out that offer of a vaccination: if they are due a booster please take it but equally the evergreen offer is there so anyone who's not had a first or second jab can still access services anytime.""And the flu jab is also an important way of just protecting yourself, protecting the people you love.""The other thing that the public can do to help us is still to come forward if they have health concerns or worrying symptoms, because the NHS is here for our patients.""And that's true over what will be a very busy winter, just as it's been true over the last 18 months.""The head of the NHS in England has said the health service is facing ""really significant pressures"", with workers dealing with a combination of the backlog, normal seasonal illnesses, the vaccination programme and a resurgence of Covid. Amanda Pritchard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We have ongoing pressures from Covid. ""Yesterday there were 6,864 patients in hospital with Covid; we've seen demand rebound for urgent emergency care services. The most recent data that we published just last week tells that story very clearly - the highest ever number of 999 calls in a month and over 1.4 million people treated in A&E departments. ""Colleagues are giving really significant focus to recovering services affected by Covid - especially tackling backlogs; and we're maintaining that vaccination programme,"" she added. ""But the other thing is the pressures on social care too and that has an impact on us - thousands of patients now in hospital who do need social care support to go home safely.""A total of 995 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending November 5 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).This is up 16 per cent on the previous week and is the highest number since the week to March 12.Around one in 12 (8.6 per cent) of all deaths registered in England and Wales in the week to November 5 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate.Yesterday Boris Johnson would not rule out more restrictions being reimposed, including around Christmas, as he urged people to get their booster jabs.A minister has warned of the challenges of being ""pinpoint accurate"" when monitoring people who may be at risk of radicalisation.Damian Hinds, the security minister, said security services ""strive to do that as much as possible, to put in place the support for individuals and to identify individuals who might be at risk"".He told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme: ""Yes, of course, we recognise that there are often links between mental health issues in individuals and some of these very dark routes that people go down.""Obviously for the vast, vast majority of people with mental health issues, that doesn't become a problem, but in a minority, small minority, of cases, it does, and that, of course, is something we have to be constantly working on too.""Earlier today, Mr Hinds suggested the lockdown had ""exacerbated"" the problem - see 7:56am for more.As has become the norm in recent weeks, Boris Johnson is fighting bad news on multiple fronts. But perhaps the one that might make him most concerned is the string of coordinated front pages by newspapers from the North and Midlands, ahead of the major transport announcement on Thursday. The Government is expected to significantly water down its promised Northern Powerhouse Rail project and scrap the eastern leg of HS2 - sparking frustration from parts of the country who argue their transport networks are perennially under-funded.  It comes an already tough time for Red Wall MPs, with frustrations about the PM's climate change agenda and the ongoing sleaze row also eroding support from former Labour voters. MANCHESTER EVENING NEWS - and an alliance of Northern papers: Trainspotting #TomorrowsPapersToday The Owen Paterson motion is back, this time with an hour’s protected debate time. I bet Jacob Rees-Mogg can hardly wait...A minister has said ""people's lives are being put in danger"" by crossing the Channel, as Priti Patel and her French counterpart have pledged to stop “100 per cent” of migrant crossings.The Home Secretary and Gerald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, agreed in online talks on Monday night to “accelerate” their efforts to make small boat crossings “unviable.”Damian Hinds, the security minister, told ITV's Good Morning Britain the crossings were ""perilous journeys run, often, by sophisticated organised crime gangs"".Mr Hinds said: ""It's a multinational operation, and we have to disrupt it and prevent these terrible risks being taken.""He added that work with the French to stop the crossings was co-operative but ""we need to go further"".A Conservative councillor has apologised after posting a mocked-up picture showing Jeremy Corbyn holding a wreath while standing at the burning wreck of the taxi blown up in the Liverpool attack at the weekend. East RidingCllr Paul Nickerson shared the picture last night with the caption ""unsurprisingly"". This morning he tweeted: ""I would like to apologies for a political tweet sent from my account yesterday which has been upsetting for some people and I unreservedly apologise to all concerned.""But Karl Turner, Labour's MP for East Hull, said it was "" grotesque"".""Anybody would be utterly disgusted that any elected member of any political party would make light of a terror attack on mainland Britain on the very day that our Home Secretary has had to raise the threat level,"" he added. ""It must be investigated immediately.""Boris Johnson should channel John Major in looking to clear up Tory sleaze, Gus O'Donnell has said. The former cabinet secretary, who served under the ex-prime minister in the 1990s, is one of five to have called for stronger powers for the prime minister’s ethics adviser. Mr O'Donnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was a ""very timely moment"" for the Boris Johnson to adopt recommendations made in a report by the committee on standards in public life and bolster the standards regime. ""When John Major was faced with all sorts of sleaze issues, he set up systems to improve integrity and trust in public life,"" he added. ""We would like the Prime Minister to look at this report and institute their recommendations."" But asked if an overhaul of the rules would be enough, he added: ""You can do quite a lot by rules and legislation by forcing people to behave in certain ways but ideally you want people who have a strong instinct for public sector ethos and obeying the rules.""Good people make for good government,"" Mr O'Donnell said. The shadow home secretary has suggested there might be need for a judge-led inquiry into so-called ""lone wolf"" attackers.Speaking on BBC Breakfast the day after the terror threat level was raised, Nick Thomas-Symonds urged caution in ""drawing conclusions too quickly about the background of the perpetrator in this case"", noting that ""different details will emerge over time and we need to get that full picture to make an assessment in this particular instance as to whether more could have been done"".He added: ""We don't know the specific conclusions in the case in Liverpool yet as to whether someone was acting alone or in concert, and I'm not for a moment drawing that conclusion too prematurely.""But I do think we need to be looking at the attacks that have taken place. Do we need something like a judge-led inquiry to look at the issue of lone attackers? And we need now, as I say, to get this investigation concluded as swiftly as possible, and then to look at the wider conclusions that perhaps we need to draw.""The number of UK workers on company payrolls surged by 160,000 last month and there was no sign of a jump in redundancies despite the furlough support scheme coming to an end, according to official figures.The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said payrolled workers jumped by 0.6% between September and October to 29.3 million - ""well above"" levels seen before the pandemic struck.The unemployment rate also fell once more to 4.3 per cent between July to September, down from 4.5% between June and August, in spite of the furlough scheme coming to an end on September 30.Rishi Sunak said the latest jobs figures were ""testament to the extraordinary success of the furlough scheme"".The Chancellor added: ""We know how vital keeping people in good jobs is, both for them and for our economy - which is why it's fantastic to see the unemployment rate falling for nine months in a row and record numbers of people moving into employment.""It's not quite Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Chris Bryant has promised ""I'll be there"" for today's debate on sleaze, which was forced after Christopher Chope blocked a motion last night. The chairman of the standards committee - who is one of several senior MPs to be grilling Boris Johnson during tomorrow's liaison committee hearing - has taken a dim view of the whole row.He said last night: ""Unfortunately, because a single MP objected to the motion endorsing the committee on standards report on Owen Paterson, the house has still not resolved this matter.""The govt will have to bring it forward ASAP wit time allocated, if the house isn’t to fall into further disrepute.""He later added:I’m told there will be a one hour debate tomorrow on rescinding the motion from two weeks ago and approving the standards committee report on Owen Paterson. I’ll be there.Efforts to block a bid to endorse the investigation into former MP Owen Paterson and scrap controversial standards reforms were ""breathtaking"", the shadow home secretary has said.Speaking the morning after Christopher Chope blocked a motion rescinding the controversial Leadsom Amendment, Nick Thomas-Symonds told LBC: ""We've had a situation first of all where Owen Paterson, who was then one of the Government's senior backbench MPs, was found very clearly to have broken the rules.""The Government has firstly avoided endorsing that report by frankly ripping up the rules and deciding just because the Government didn't like the conclusion that had been drawn, it would change the system.""We now are in a situation where, unbelievably, another of the Government's backbenchers still won't accept the conclusion of the report.""Levelling up is ""infused in everything the Government does"", a minister has insisted, despite the Government's expected decision to scrap the eastern leg of HS2 between the Midlands and Leeds.Red Wall Tory MPs are up in arms over the expected announcement, which they fear will lose them support in seats where support for the Conservatives is already ebbing. Damian Hinds, the security minister, said he could not comment ahead of the Integrated Rail Plan's expected release on Thursday.But he told Sky News: ""We're absolutely committed to levelling up, I think that runs through... is infused in everything Government does, transport also is part of that, and so and so many other things.""On the specifics of the railways, we're going to have to wait for the integrated rail review.""An investigation will be carried out into allegations made against the Prime Minister's father ""if that's the appropriate course of action"", a minister has said.Asked about the allegations against Stanley Johnson (see posts below), Damian Hinds told Times Radio: ""I don't know obviously about the ... I've heard this morning, as you have, or overnight, about this, about these allegations.""I can say that, overall, in terms of the safety of women and girls, and being free from harassment wherever they are at home, at work, in the street, and online, this is an absolute top priority for the Government,"" the security minister said. He added: ""If there is an investigation to be had, if that is the appropriate course of action, then of course that will happen.""Caroline Nokes claim that Stanley Johnson ""smacking"" her on the backside has prompted a female journalist to also accuse the Prime Minister's father of having groped her. Ailbha Rae, political correspondent at the New Statesman, claimed the incident happened just two years ago.Stanley Johnson also groped me at a party at Conservative conference in 2019. I am grateful to Caroline Nokes for calling out something that none of us should have to put up with, not least from the Prime Minister's father. https://t.co/Uf6lEdatuxA senior Conservative MP has accused Stanley Johnson of inappropriately touching them.Caroline Nokes, the chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, suggested that the Prime Minister's father inappropriately touched her during the Conservative Party conference in Blackpool 2003 ahead of Mr Johnson running in the Teignbridge seat in Devon in 2005.""I've had male MPs stick their hands on my backside in Strangers' Bar (in Parliament),"" the former minister said during a panel discussion. And I can remember a really prominent man smacking me on the backside about as hard as he could and going, 'Oh, Romsey, you've got a lovely seat'.""Stanley Johnson did that to me ahead of the '05 election, so it was Blackpool... 2003/4. ""I didn't do anything and I feel ashamed by that... now I probably would.""Mr Johnson declined to comment about her allegation made to Sky News, other than to say he has ""no recollection of Caroline Nokes at all"".Lockdown may have ""exacerbated"" the number of people self-radicalising online, the defence minister has said. Speaking the day after the terror threat level was increased, in the wake of the Liverpool attack and murder of Sir David Amess, Damian Hinds said there were ""multiple times when we are protected from this, there've been over 30 late-stage plot disruptions in the last few years"".He told Sky New: ""During lockdown there have been more people spending more time in front of computer screens and when that happens, a small minority - very small - can be radicalised.""He added: ""Changes we saw through coronavirus, through lockdown, will have exacerbated and increased the amount of time they spend online.""European nations must choose between “mainlining” Russian gas and defending peace in Ukraine, Boris Johnson said on Monday amid escalating tensions with the Kremlin.The Prime Minister’s message, contained in his pre-written Mansion House speech, appeared especially aimed at Germany, which has championed the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, has pushed ahead with the gas pipeline between Russia and Europe, despite US and UK opposition, but will soon be leaving office.The intervention came as Russian troops continued to gather near Ukraine, prompting fears of an imminent invasion, and tensions over migration escalated at the Polish-Belarus border.Boris Johnson's hopes of drawing a line under the sleaze row have been thwarted by one of his own backbenchers, after Christopher Chope objected to the motion last night. The PM is also faced with some rather serious allegations about his own father groping a Tory MP and a female journalist - the latter happening just two years ago. Meanwhile, further details are emerging from Liverpool. Here is today's front page.We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Visit our adblocking instructions

Priti Patel and her French counterpart have pledged to stop “100 per cent” of migrant crossings after crisis talks in the wake of record numbers reaching the UK.The Home Secretary and Gerald Darmanin, France’s interior minister, agreed in online talks on Monday night to “accelerate” their efforts to make small boat crossings “unviable.”The meeting followed a war of words between London and Paris after a  this year, nearly treble the total for 2020 and including the highest ever daily total of 1,185 on Thursday last week.Ms Patel is pressing for Mr Darmanin to speed up the delivery of his commitment to intercept 100 per cent of migrants before they reach the UK in return for the £54 million UK Government funds for extra patrols and surveillance. The French stopped just 99, less than one in 10 migrants, on Thursday.Mr Darmanin on Monday said Britain was  to the French and urged British politicians to stop using France as “a punch-ball in their domestic politics.”Last night I spoke to my French counterpart @GDarmanin to discuss the problem of small boats crossing the Channel.We discussed a range of additional steps to tackle the problem and reiterated the importance of working together to make this deadly route unviable.🇬🇧🇫🇷 “Both the Home Secretary and Interior Minister agreed to strengthen operational cooperation further.
