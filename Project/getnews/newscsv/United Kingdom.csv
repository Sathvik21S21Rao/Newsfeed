"Pundit begs Man Utd to consider Prem boss in Solskjaer replacement hunt - Teamtalk.com
A pundit has urged Man Utd to consider hiring a current Premier League manager if they part with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.The Norwegian’s reign is on the brink of collapse after a shocking 5-0 defeat against Liverpool on Sunday. His team was outplayed, outfought and outrun by Jurgen Klopp’s high-pressing side.After the match, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher were among those picking apart Solskjaer’s tactics.They said Man Utd lacked any real identity and allowed Liverpool too much time in all areas of the pitch.Rumours have since swirled debating when Solskjaer will be sacked, as if it is a foregone conclusion. Italian outlet SportMediaset write that Antonio Conte is being ‘seriously considered’ by Man Utd chiefs.The 52-year-old is highly regarded after winning league titles with Chelsea, Juventus and Inter Milan.Another manager linked with the role is Frenchman Zinedine Zidane. However, the Ballon d’Or winner  as he wants to manage either Paris Saint-Germain or the French national team next.Now, former striker Stan Collymore has told the Red Devils to consider a swoop for an active Premier League boss.: “If you were piecing together an identikit picture for the next Man Utd manager – it might just come out looking like Brendan Rodgers.“The Leicester boss fits every criteria for what’s required at Old Trafford. It’s a no brainer.“The United board would have to get Rodgers’ Liverpool connection completely out of their heads. Then chuck a load of compensation Leicester’s way and seal the deal.Give our social media channels a follow – we’re on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram“Rodgers has been at big clubs and won things. He’s not learning on the job like Ole. He would make Jadon Sancho better; he would make Marcus Rashford better.“He’s got self-belief, he’s an astute ‘politician’ and he likes to play with the kind of attractive style that United fans demand.”Rodgers took over at Leicester in February 2019 following the sacking of Claude Puel. He has helped the Foxes to win the FA Cup and Community Shield since then.Meanwhile,  for his performance in the Liverpool game.Solskjaer turned to the Frenchman at half-time, when it was already 4-0 in Liverpool’s favour. Pogba did nothing to help, giving the ball away for a fifth goal. He was then sent off for a dangerous two-footed challenge on Naby Keita.Scholes told Premier League Productions: “Paul Pogba coming on to the pitch at half-time to try to help the team and maybe get a little respectability, tries to stand on the ball, tries to show how strong he is in the middle of the pitch… gives the goal away.“Then later on gets sent off with a ridiculous tackle, now you’re 5-0 down with 10 men. You’d have to think, if Ole’s still a manager there, will we see Pogba again in a United shirt?“He’s caused mayhem over the last couple of years. Everyone knows what a talent he is. Everybody trusts him, every manager trusts him, tried to give him his head and let him be the player he’s been.“But with all the commotion, not signing his contract, almost holding the club to ransom. And then he comes on and does something like that. It’s not Ole’s fault, don’t get me wrong. But that’s part of it that almost summed the United performance up today.”READ MORE: ",https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/10/25205100/brendan-rodgers-interacts-with-ralph-hasenhuttl-before-leicester-vs-southampton-in-fa-cup.jpg,"Walter Smith: Former Rangers, Everton and Scotland boss dies aged 73 - Sky Sports
Walter Smith, who managed Scotland, Rangers and Everton, has died at the age of 73.Smith enjoyed great success with Rangers over two spells, took charge of the Scotland national side and spent four years in the Premier League with Everton.The Lanark-born defender's playing career saw him play for Dundee United in two spells either side of two seasons at Dumbarton, and it was during his second spell at Tannadice that a pelvic injury meant Smith made his first forays into coaching under Jim McLean.Smith became coach of the Scotland under-18s in 1978 and the under-21s in 1982. He was also Alex Ferguson's assistant at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico before becoming assistant to Graeme Souness at Rangers later that summer.With Souness operating as a player-manager at Ibrox, Smith was the senior coaching presence on the touchline and was given the job on a full-time basis when Souness moved to manage Liverpool in 1991.Smith continued Rangers' domination at home and in Europe, taking the club to six Scottish top-flight titles and a domestic treble in 1992-93, the season in which the club narrowly missed out on a place in the Champions League final after finishing as runners-up in the group which was won by eventual winners Marseille.His time at Goodison Park, however, was not a success and he was sacked in March 2002 before a brief spell as Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United at the end of the 2003-04 season.Berti Vogts departure from the Scotland national side paved the way for Smith to become manager in December 2004. Despite overseeing a rise for Scotland of 70 places in the international rankings, they failed to reach the World Cup Finals in 2006 after a home defeat to Belarus.Smith returned to Rangers for a second spell in January 2007 and was able to replicate the glory of his first spell, leading the club to three more league titles, two Scottish Cups, three Scottish League Cups and a UEFA Cup final, which they lost 2-0 to Zenit Saint Petersburg.",https://e0.365dm.com/21/03/768x432/skysports-walter-smith-rangers_5303590.png?20210313172248,"Horner: Chuck F1 form book away in F1 title run-in - Motorsport.com
RBR and Max Verstappen are widely regarded as favourites for the event, with the Dutchman having won in 2017 and 2018 and been fastest in qualifying in 2019 before he received a grid penalty.However, after Verstappen won last weekend’s US GP in Austin – a track usually associated with success for Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes – Horner says it’s impossible to predict which of the title contenders will have the upper hand.""I think you've got to chuck the form book away,” he said. “It's very tight between the two teams. Mexico has been a good track for us, but it's been a good track for them as well, on occasion. So we don't we don't underestimate them.”Horner stressed that the Austin success was significant for his team: ""They are all important, but this is a big one, because this has been such a stronghold of Lewis and Mercedes.“So to get the pole was a landmark moment for us, and then to convert into a win, even not leading on the first lap.”He added that the team cannot become too confident, despite the Austin result extending Verstappen’s lead.“You've got to attack. So 12 points is nothing, it can disappear very, very quickly, as we've seen previously.“So we've got to keep attacking race weekends and get the most out of them that we possibly can. And five to go, the pressure only gets bigger.""Mercedes trackside engineering director Andrew Shovlin admitted that the world champions expect a tough fight with Red Bull in Mexico.“If you look ahead to Mexico, that is a track in the past that has suited them and has suited the Honda power unit,” he said.“But regardless of that we’ve still got to arrive with a car that is performing at the best of the car’s ability, and give a car to Lewis and Valtteri [Bottas] that allows them to do their best job.“That is the only thing we are working on, we are not really worrying about where Red Bull are.""Asked if Mercedes could surprise RBR in Mexico, Shovlin said: “Honestly, if we can take the race to them like we did today that is probably the best case scenario that we can envisage.“There is a lot to do, and it is such a different circuit, and such a different environment for the power unit to operate in.“But there have not been many circuits where we have been far off the pace. We have struggled in Monaco, we were struggling in Baku and we struggled a bit in the second Austria, but there are more of them where we can challenge and we can challenge for pole.“As I said we know we’ve struggled there in the past, and we know what we need to be working on in the next week or so, and that is what we will get stuck into.”",https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/amp/2jXZEep6/s1000/formula-1-united-states-gp-202-2.jpg,"‘It’s fantastic’: Australia reacts with enthusiasm to Ben Stokes’ Ashes inclusion - The Guardian

"Elon Musk's driverless car dream threatens Tesla's $1 trillion value - Telegraph.co.uk
When a new piece of software breaks on your computer, it is a productivity-inhibiting minor annoyance: certain features may stop working, or at a push you may have to turn your machine off and on again. When that software is controlling a two-ton vehicle travelling at 70 miles an hour, we should probably adjust the risk profile.For the last year, Tesla has allowed a growing pool of American owners access to early versions of its “full self-driving” technology, which is permitted for use on public US roads.The beta software, delivered via a wireless update over the internet, is a supposed step on the way to the company’s promise that , letting its owners focus on watching Netflix or playing video games from the front seat.The software’s beta tests, however, have been anything but flawless. Videos of Teslas equipped with “full self-driving” narrowly missing other cars and pedestrians have gone viral.The company has started asking testers to stop sharing clips of the software making mistakes, claiming that there are “a lot of people that want Tesla to fail”.Over the weekend, Tesla pulled the latest full self-driving update, less than a day after it had been released, after a string of horror stories. Drivers said the software had repeatedly triggered phantom “forward collision warnings”, which can apply the brakes in anticipation of a crash. “I was going 80mph and my emergency brakes kicked in. Almost sent me sideways on a six-lane highway,” one said.Tesla insists full self-driving is merely an advanced driver assistance feature, still in testing, and requires human attention, but the name alone is enough to create confusion.Its arguably premature introduction is part of a pattern of Elon Musk’s seemingly boundless optimism when it comes to the company’s engineering prowess.In 2016, Tesla’s chief promised that one of the company’s vehicles would be able to drive across the US without human intervention. In 2019, he said the cars would be able to function as robotaxis the following year. We are still waiting for both.It is part of the Musk script to set such high targets that even missing them qualifies as a success. In Tesla’s earlier years it repeatedly fell short of ambitious production deadlines, but managed to do enough to stay afloat, bringing electric cars into the mainstream when others had given up. But Tesla has reversed itself into a corner where failing to deliver on its driverless promises isn’t an option.Car production profit margins alone don’t justify . Software margins might. “The day full self-driving goes to wide release will be one of the biggest asset value increases in history,” Musk tweeted last week.The company has taken billions of dollars from customers pre-ordering the option as an added extra when buying a car. It started selling the upgrade in 2016 and has steadily raised the price.More than 350,000 buyers are estimated to have paid up front for an upgrade that some have now been waiting five years for. Any hint that Tesla will not deliver on its promises would risk deflating its valuation and anger thousands who have paid for a feature that does not exist.In general, driverless technology is improving. Google’s dreams of a production-scale autonomous vehicle by the end of the 2010s may not have been realised, but its is making steady progress.However, this has been the result of a progressive, closely monitored and hugely expensive test run by professionals in the Arizona desert. Tesla, by contrast, is effectively using its customers as guinea pigs, relying on them to carry out the open-world testing.Musk’s enthusiastic army of fans means Tesla has no shortage of willing test pilots. But that does not make public roads an appropriate laboratory for beta testing, especially when Tesla’s technology is already under scrutiny.Autopilot, the company’s less-advanced system for regulating speed and staying in lanes, is the subject of multiple investigations from US safety regulators.More forceful regulation seems inevitable. America’s highways safety agency last week appointed Missy Cummings, a vocal critic of Tesla’s Autopilot, as a safety adviser. It prompted a torrent of online abuse from Musk’s apostles that is unlikely to help the company’s prospects.Countries including the UK are legislating for driverless cars, but are doing so via a UN licensing system that Tesla’s vehicles have not yet met.Tesla’s approach, of giving users the technology and ironing out the kinks later, may be typical in Silicon Valley, but it is not one that translates well when lives are at stake.

More than 200 miles away in North London, staff at a care home recently took part in a trial that used facial data to verify their Covid-19 vaccine status. And in convenience stores around the country, staff are alerted to potential shoplifters by a smart CCTV system that taps into a database of individuals deemed suspect.In each case, biometric data has been harnessed to try to save time and money. But the growing use of our bodies to unlock areas of the public and private sphere has raised questions about everything from privacy to data security and racial bias.In other news today, potato milk is set to be the next big thing in consumer trends.Britons already eat potatoes boiled, baked, roasted and mashed but now the humble spud is being milked for all its worth, reports our consumer affairs correspondent Zoe Wood.It is tipped as a challenger to big selling alt-milks made from oats, almonds and soy, with the supermarket Waitrose predicting consumers will soon be adding it to their shopping trolley or ordering potato milk lattes in coffee shops.Sales of plant milk are booming in the UK with the market now worth about £400m a year as Britons reduce their consumption of animal products. In recent years the buzz has been around oat milk, thanks to the success of the fashionable Swedish brand Oatly, but in its annual food and drink report Waitrose predicts that “.Here is our full story on Heathrow airport, which warned today that air travel may not recover to pre-Covid levels until 2026:Whitbread shares rose 2.8% after the results. Richard Hunter, head of markets at the trading platform interactive investor, said:The company is showing no signs of slowing down strategically, with an aim for 110,000 rooms in the UK from the current 80,000, and with investment in its other major market of Germany continuing apace. For the latter, the investment is also bearing fruit, with revenues ahead of pre-pandemic levels by 197%.In the meantime, there are some encouraging signs. The occupancy rate in the UK presently stands at 81%, as compared to the 55% level which the company previously identified as being the breakeven point, while in Germany the rate has exceeded 60% in August and September. Although some seasonal slowdown is expected in the run-up to Christmas, Whitbread is confident of a return to pre-pandemic profit margins despite the current challenges.Clearly, this will not be an overnight fix for Whitbread but on balance the group is at least in the position of being able to ratchet up the growth in the areas within its control. The share price has also reflected some of the recent optimism, having risen by 32% over the last year as compared to a jump of 25% for the wider FTSE100 and with an immediate outlook which is significantly more promising than has been the case for some considerable time, the market consensus of the shares as a strong buy also remains intact.The former financial analyst and City veteran David Buik has tweeted:Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:It’s taken a while for Premier Inn owner Whitbread to regain momentum, but with trading ahead of pre-pandemic levels over the summer holidays and well ahead of the wider market the group looks well placed going into 2022. Management have gone so far as to say they think revenues may fully recover this financial year.The pandemic has likely seen smaller operators forced to close, creating a gap into which Whitbread can expand in the UK. Meanwhile expansion in Germany is gathering speed with a pipeline that has the potential to more than double the current active estate. However current bookings in Germany remain low and the group has work to do in improving its brand visibility.There are more general short term challenges too. Labour shortages have the potential to push up costs, while the course of recovery is unpredictable – with new restrictions a very real possibility. However, thanks to support from lenders, Whitbread has the balance sheet to weather disruption. That might have cost investors access to a dividend in the medium term, but the longer term opportunity is well worth it.Premier Inn owner Whitbread has reported a much smaller half-year loss and said there is potential for a full recovery at its UK hotels “at some point” next year. But it also warned about staff shortages, which are affecting the entire hospitality sector, and said “a material number of vacancies still remain unfilled”. It is raising staff wages to remain competitive, at an additional cost of £12m to £13m this year, and will also pay £10m in one-off summer retention bonuses for hotel and restaurant staff.The company, which owns the UK’s biggest hotel chain along with the Beefeater and Brewers Fayre restaurant chains (but sold Costa Coffee to Coca-Cola two years ago), posted an adjusted pre-tax loss of £56.6m for the six months to 26 August, a big improvement on the year-earlier loss of £367.4m.Alison Brittain, the chief executive, said:Sales recovery is ahead of expectations, and while a number of uncertainties remain, UK like-for-like revenues revenue per available room run rate has the potential to reach full recovery at some point in 2022.Hospitality wide-labour shortages also persist, particularly in tourist locations and in London. Whitbread is in a better position than most due to the action taken last year that resulted in the retention of a greater number of employees than initially anticipated. Despite this, a material number of vacancies still remain unfilled. She said it “may well take time” to tackle this shortfall.We will continue to monitor the market to ensure our pay rates remain competitive.Heathrow Airport warned this morning that it faces “a long road ahead” after it ran up losses of more than £1bn in the first nine months of the year. It said that it could be “on the cusp of a recovery” as travel returns, but does not expect traffic to fully recover until at least 2026.The airport has racked up total losses of £3.4bn since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, when economies locked down and brought travel to an abrupt halt.Heathrow, the UK’s biggest airport, reported its first quarter of passenger growth since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as the UK government relaxed travel restrictions, encouraging more people to fly abroad.Passenger numbers in the three months to the end of September recovered to 28% of pre-pandemic levels while cargo climbed to 90% of its levels in 2019 over the last quarter, it said.Heathrow, which last year lost its crown as Europe’s busiest hub to Paris, has tried to claw back losses by raising its passenger charges but last week . Charges will still rise by up to 56% by 2023. The Civil Aviation Authority has proposed an increase from £22 a passenger in 2020 to a range of £24.50 to £34.40, which has angered airlines.John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive, said:We are on the cusp of a recovery which will unleash pent-up demand, create new quality jobs and see Britain’s trade roar back to life - but it risks a hard landing unless secured for the long-haul. To do that, we need continued focus on the global vaccination programme so that borders can reopen without testing; we need a fair financial settlement from the CAA to sustain service and resilience after 15 years of negative real returns for investors; and we need a progressively increasing global mandate for sustainable aviation fuels so that we can protect the benefits of aviation in a world without carbon.Last night, Facebook reported a profit of more than $9bn in the third quarter, meeting investor predictions, as the company faces an onslaught of negative publicity over a major release of whistleblower documents.The company revealed in its Monday earnings report that it saw a 6% year-on-year increase in daily active users, reaching an average of 1.93 billion for September 2021. Its revenue grew 35% to $29.01bn, thanks to a boom in online advertising.Facebook’s financial wins came amid intense scrutiny, after a consortium of news organizations published stories on Monday based on documents leaked by the whistleblower Frances Haugen. Haugen testified on Monday in front of British MPs calling for external regulation of Facebook.My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff, our banking correspondent, has taken a look at why UK banks – led by HSBC and Barclays – have so far reported bumper profit rises for the third quarter, which they say reflects improving economic forecasts.

In October, the Ifo institute’s export expectations index fell to 13.0 points from 20.5 points in September, the lowest value since February. The institute said supply problems of materials used to make German goods (such as chips) are affecting exports. Expectations have slipped in the electrical and electronics sector, though they remain high, but the mood is bleaker in the chemical, car, and textile and leather industries.South Korean carmaker Hyundai missed analysts’ forecasts as the global chip crisis took its toll on car exports. It warned that it would take a long time for chip supplies to get back to normal levels.The French car parts maker Faurecia has also been hit by the semiconductor shortage which has prompted its customers to scale back production, and posted a more than 10% drop in third-quarter sales.In China, another property developer has defaulted, adding to worries about the sector caused by the debt crisis at Evergrande Group.

I still get anxiety at the start of every working day,” says Edgar Wright, now almost 27 years into his filmmaking career. Outwardly, the director of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead is confident – gregarious even, both on set and today on video call from a London hotel – but he is hardly immune to nerves. “I get asked by film students if I ever suffer from imposter syndrome,” he explains, “and I say, ‘Yes, every single day.’ I always walk onto set thinking that I’m going to be found out, especially when you’re trying something new. You’re putting yourself out there. And with this, I’m putting myself out there.”“This” is Last Night in Soho, one of the most startling films of Wright’s career to date. Those expecting the wit and geeky weirdness of his directorial debut, A Fistful of Fingers, or hit Channel 4 television series Spaced may be disappointed. There’s no zombie apocalypse to contend with, as in Shaun of the Dead, no murderous village preservation societies, Hot Fuzz-style, and no blue-blooded aliens trying to take over Earth, à la The World’s End. There’s no Scott Pilgrim vs The World comic-book wizardry either, and nor are there any thrill-seeking Baby Driver car chases. As about-turns go, it’s a sharp one.“It’s nearly a decade since I spoke about it to my producer, Nira Park,” Wright explains, sitting on the carpet of his hotel room, back against the sofa. “I was gearing up to do something radically different with this. Having done Baby Driver – which wasn’t an outright comedy, it was more of an action thriller – certainly helped. If I’d gone from The World’s End into this, people would have gotten whiplash. I think for better or worse, the best thing to do is always bite off more than you can chew.”Last Night in Soho is certainly an ambitious film. The dark psychological thriller sees teenager Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie) travel from Cornwall to London to study fashion. She’s obsessed with the Sixties and finds herself living in a Soho bedsit with landlady Ms Collins (Diana Rigg) after struggling to adjust to living in halls with her peers. She also happens to have a psychic ability, and starts to connect with the story of Sandie (Anya Taylor Joy) and Jack (Matt Smith) through dream-like time travels from her room into the dark, seedy underbelly of Sixties Soho. The “Swinging Sixties” narrative is flipped on its head entirely: here, it’s a place where women’s dreams are shattered in a world dominated by toxic masculinity.Four of the film’s actors were at the height of their fame in that very decade: Rita Tushingham, Terrence Stamp, Diana Rigg and Margaret Nolan. Rigg died in September 2020, when Wright was in his additional filming phase post-lockdown (he dedicated the film to her), and Nolan just a month later in October 2020. “They were the epicentre of the scene we’re portraying in the film and their perceptions were really fascinating to me,” Wright says, still clearly affected by the loss. With Rigg in particular, Wright had built up a friendship beyond the film: he visited her just two weeks before she died.“A fond memory in early lockdown was speaking to Diana every couple of weeks about what films she’d been enjoying on Talking Pictures TV – a channel we both loved,” Wright says. “It’s still tough for me to talk about her without welling up.” Despite being increasingly infirm, Rigg insisted Wright visit her bedside after lockdown to complete an ADR session (the process of re-recording any unclear dialogue after filming). Wright took her a bottle of Campari, one of her favourite tipples, and the two shared a final drink together while recording her last audios for the film. “I thought that last one was rather good,” she told Wright, delighted to still be working despite her illness. Before he left, the two “had a right old gossip and reminisced about the shoot”. It was the last time he saw her.Wright has another particularly special memory of Rigg, this one on set in 2019. Rehearsing next to a grandiose mock-up of the famed Café de Paris in London’s West End, she inadvertently revealed a memory to Wright that echoed one of the main themes of the film. “Diana said: ‘Oh, I went there on my 18th birthday to see Shirley Bassey’s first London gig,’” Wright recalls, smiling. “I mean, hearing that alone was just mind-blowing to conceive of. I asked her if she would like to see the set and she said she’d love to. It was magical walking through an empty sound stage with Diana Rigg on my arm and into our Café de Paris. Then she said: ‘Oh it’s amazing, this is exactly as I remember it.’ Then there was this ‘dot, dot, dot’ moment.”Curtain call: The late Dame Diana Rigg in ‘Last Night in Soho'Rigg was silent for a time, taking stock of the scene. “Diana took this pause and said: ‘I remember walking down those stairs and lots of rheumy-eyed men looking me up and down and feeling like a piece of meat.’ She said this unprompted. The whole theme of this movie is almost that ‘dot, dot, dot’ moment – the three dots between the good and the bad. I don’t think she was thinking about the film or Anya’s character, but she’d basically just described Sandie’s first scene in the film.”The scene in question sees Taylor-Joy’s character walk into a venue with dreams of being a musician. She’s immediately objectified by dozens of men, and later at the hands of her sleazy manager, Jack. On her arrival to London 60 years later, McKenzie’s Eloise is also subjected to unwanted male attention. “It was to show how little has changed [for women],” Wright explains. “It was to stress that everything that is toxic now was just as bad then, perhaps even worse. It was to show a note of caution on overly romanticising the past.”Those dangers are central to the film. Wright first explained its concept to his co-writer, 1917’s Krysty Wilson-Cairns, on a night out in Soho in 2016 – the night the Brexit vote came in. “I feel like even if we didn’t mean to say this about Brexit, there really is a Nostradamus element to this. The film is a rebuke to looking back with rose-tinted lenses to the past. There’s no perfect decade. The idea of there being the ‘good old days’ in any form is a fallacy – and dangerous, as we have seen. To me, dreaming about the past and being overly nostalgic is a retreat from the present day and perhaps a failure to deal with it.”This is now the third film of Wright’s “where people have pointed to either a direct nod to Brexit or an indicator of Brexit”, he says with a laugh. “People have said the same thing about Hot Fuzz or The World’s End – that Gary King telling the network to f*** off is essentially like Britain as an isolationist telling the EU to get stuffed and tipping us into an apocalypse immediately.” Wright, who voted to stay in the EU, adds that maybe these people had a point.A brand new dance: Edgar Wright, Anya Taylor-Joy and Matt Smith on the set of ‘Last Night in Soho’Still, he’s been guilty of romanticising the past himself. “I’ve been obsessed with previous decades. If I’m obsessed with the idea of time travel and going back, what does that say about me? Does that say I’d rather live in some fantasy than deal with the modern day? Sadly, probably yes.”Wright’s previous, male-dominated films haven’t exactly fared well on the Bechdel Test (a measure of how much women feature in a work of fiction). This is the first time he’s had women front-and-centre – though he’s always had a core female film-making team at the heart of his work.This time around, that includes Lucy Pardee. The Bafta-winning casting director for bold coming-of-age drama Rocks spent a year painstakingly researching “real-life testimonies from people who worked in Soho both then and now”, Wright explains. The stories of “back then” were often brutal, and mirrored Sandie’s devastating treatment at the hands of men.Wright also drew on the experiences of women close to him, as did co-writer Wilson-Cairns (including her own from her days living and working in Soho at the Toucan pub, which features heavily in the film). “Eloise herself is an amalgam of experiences from myself, Krysty, my mother, her mother and grandmother, my sister-in-law,” says Wright. His mum and sister-in-law studied fashion and Wilson-Cairns’ mother and grandmother were seamstresses. “I think one would be surprised at just how much comes from real life, but that hopefully makes the film resonate – injecting the personal into the fantastical,” Wright says, although he’s been doing that for years.Wright on the set of ‘Last Night in Soho’ with Krysty Wilson-CairnsA more surprising autobiographical twist: Wright’s mother is “supernaturally switched on”, just like Eloise. “My brother and I were so envious we didn’t have this ability, but my mother was very receptive in terms of presences and visions.” Has she ever seen a ghost? “Oh yes!” She once told the family she’d seen a ghost of a hanged man in the living room of their 400-year-old Somerset home. The family dismissed the story at first, only to discover some time later that a man did indeed die from suicide in the same room years earlier.“If I said to people, ‘This is my most autobiographical film,’ they would immediately reply with, ‘What the f*** are you talking about?!’” says Wright. “In the same way when I say Hot Fuzz is very autobiographical, people are like, ‘But wait, you’re not a policeman, and you’ve never had to battle a killer cult!’ But it’s like, ‘Yes, but everything else is true.’” He grew up in a small village just like the one in the film. “I guess in a way, when you make a lot of these films, you’re trying to process your own feelings about times, people and places.”It was The World’s End, however, co-written with Wright’s friend Simon Pegg, where the most autobiographical processing took place. It was based on Pegg’s real-life alcohol addiction, something the actor spoke about for the first time in 2018. “When we were writing that film, I obviously knew what the issue was with Simon. I’d been there – I’d literally been with him in hospital at one point when things had gotten especially bad. But when we were writing it, his addiction [became] the elephant in the room. Gary [King, the character Pegg plays in the film] was a way of talking about Simon.”Pegg couldn’t talk about himself in the first person when they wrote together. “He wouldn’t say, ‘I’, he would say: ‘I think Gary would say this.’ When we did the press for that, Simon hadn’t yet talked about his battles publicly. People would ask all the time: ‘Is this Gary King based on anyone you know?’ and we’d always answer: ‘It’s based on lots of people,’ so we’d throw people off the scent.” Pegg was fresh out of therapy and it was still too raw to discuss. When he finally spoke publicly about his battles, “I was very proud of him,” says Wright. “I didn’t know he was going to do that and when I read it in the paper, I called him and said how proud I was of him for talking about it finally. It wasn’t easy.”Simon Pegg as Gary King in ‘The World’s End'Wright says dealing with the personal in filmmaking can be especially tough – but if the result is a better film, it’s worth the pain. “I guess when you see the finished result, it [shows] the reason why you put yourself through it. On the one hand, it’s the best job in the world – I get to do what was once a hobby for me as my job, so I would never complain about it. I’m not working down a coal mine. But it is and can be mentally stressful in ways that are difficult to articulate, or gain any sympathy for.”One of the most mentally challenging moments for Wright was the anxiety and responsibility that came with being one of the first shoots to open post-lockdown. “When we’d managed to get to the end of the additional shooting on the final day, it was bittersweet for me,” Wright says. “People kept making the same joke, which was like, ‘Oh it’s a shame we can’t keep going’ and it was the first time I felt less like a director and more like an employer. It became very apparent to me that I was a director but also a jobs creator and I felt very responsible for all these people finally getting some work after lockdown. I felt bad we didn’t have more to do.”After the hit cinemas took during the past year, showing the film on the big screen is important to Wright. “If that opportunity went away forever, I think we’d be really bereft. I get annoyed by the amount of doomy ‘Is cinema dead?’ articles. We should all just be pulling together right now. I honestly have no schadenfreude to any other movies now. Maybe in a pre-pandemic time, I might be a bit sniffy about certain big franchises that I didn’t care for. I’m now pulling for everything. I saw No Time to Die last week for a second time and I got emotional being in a busy cinema with an excited audience. I started to well up during the adverts.” He smiles. “If it’s saving cinema, then it’s good.”Edgar Wright: 'I think for better or worse, the best thing to do is always bite off more than you can chew’Curtain call: The late Dame Diana Rigg in ‘Last Night in Soho'A brand new dance: Edgar Wright, Anya Taylor-Joy and Matt Smith on the set of ‘Last Night in Soho’Wright on the set of ‘Last Night in Soho’ with Krysty Wilson-CairnsSimon Pegg as Gary King in ‘The World’s End'Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

"Scientists explain intriguing signal picked up while searching for aliens in nearby planetary system - The Independent
Scientists have finally found an explanation for an intriguing signal seeming to come from our nearest neighbour, found while looking for alien life.Last year, radio telescopes appeared to be getting data from the Proxima Centauri system that could be indicative of alien technology.Since then, Breakthrough Listen – a major project to search for life elsewhere in the universe – has been analysing the signal, to find out whether it might really be coming from another civilisation.They found that the signal in fact appears to be an artifact from human technologies, according to two new papers published in the journal Nature Astronomy.But Yuri Milner, the Russian billionaire who founded the Breakthrough Listen project, said that the research represented a major step in the search for alien life – despite the fact it had found the opposite in this case.“The significance of this result is that the search for civilisations beyond our planet is now a mature, rigorous field of experimental science,” he said.Those astronomers who look for signs of alien civilisations, or technosignatures, have to pick through the variety of similar signals that are coming to us from Earth. Radio telescopes must try and pick through all of the radio signals created by humanity – from our phones, television transmitters, radar systems and more – and filter them out from any possible signals coming from Earth.The latest papers concentrate on the effort to do that at the CSIRO Parkes Telescope in New South Wales, Australia, which is one of the pieces of equipment involved in the Breakthrough Listen search. That telescope was used to scan Proxima Centauri, our nearest star after the Sun, which is only 4 light years away and has at least two planets orbiting it.To better examine it, astronomers looked at it through a variety of radio frequencies. The research was the equivalent of tuning into more than 800 million radio channels at one time, Breakthrough Listen.When planets are examined in this detail, a whole host of signals are likely to be picked up. As such, Breakthrough Listen runs any observations through a filter that sorts out signals that are not likely to come from a transmitter away from Earth: whether the signal changes in frequency over time, and whether they are coming from the direction of the target, which can be established by looking whether they switch off when the telescope points away.That filters out the vast majority of signals received by Breakthrough Listen. But even after that, last year’s intriguing signal remained.What’s more, it had some of the characteristics that might suggest it really was coming from an alien civilisation. That led to the possibility that the Breakthrough Listen team really had found a signal coming from aliens.But further examination found that the signal does not in fact appear to be alien – but altogether more human. While they were not able to find exactly what had caused the detection, it appears it was just specifically calculated to slip through the filters.It does however give scientists confidence that they would be able to identify real signals from alien civilisations.“While we were unable to conclude a genuine technosignature, we are increasingly confident that we have the necessary tools to detect and validate such signatures if they exist,” said S Pete Worden, executive director of the Breakthrough Initiatives.They also believe that Proxima Centauri is still an exciting prospect for finding technosignatures.“In the case of this particular candidate, our analysis suggests that it’s highly unlikely that it is really from a transmitter out at Proxima Centauri. However, this is undoubtedly one of the most intriguing signals we’ve seen to date,” said Andrew Siemion at the University of California, Berkeley, who leads the Breakthrough Listen science team.The two papers – al, and  – are both published in Nature Astronomy today.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Early last year, scientists noted the Earth had begun to spin a bit faster around its axis. After the chaos and turmoil of 2020, the news was likely welcomed by most as it meant the new year would arrive a tad bit sooner than expected. The sped-up rotation continued through the first half of this year but the planet appears to have had a change of heart and is now spinning at a slower rate.On average, the planet completes a full rotation around its central axis every 86,400 seconds or 24 hours.In practice, however, each spin can vary in time by fractions of a second, which over time can add to full seconds.Today, scientists keep track of the time with the aid of atomic clocks, which set the standard for Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).These ultra-accurate clocks keep a measure of the time by observing the movement of electrons in atoms chilled to absolute zero (−273.15C).READ MORE: If there is a discrepancy between the time set by the atomic clocks and the Earth's spin, scientists can add or subtract so-called ""leap seconds"" to account for the difference.Astrophysicist Graham Jones told the BBC earlier this year: ""Since the system of leap seconds was introduced in 1972, the Earth's rotation has generally been a bit slow and so far, there have been 27 leap seconds, and they have all been positive.""In other words, they have all added an extra second to our clocks, enabling the Earth to catch up.""According to Live Science and data compiled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), one such leap second was added to the clock on New Year's Eve 2016.On average, scientists have added a leap second to the clocks every 18 months or so.When the Earth's spin sped up in 2020, scientists contemplated the possibility of adding a negative leap second to make up the difference.That year's shortest day was clocked on July 19 when the planet completed a day a whole 1.4602 milliseconds faster than the 86,400-second average.But according to a report in Time and Date, the planet has slowed down once again after the average length of day grew between July 1 and September 30 by 0.05 milliseconds more than in 2020.The Earth is, consequently, spinning slower than it has in the first half of 2021, although the speed is still above average.Based on the present rate of spin, scientists may need to introduce a negative leap second in about 10 years time.DON'T MISS... [REPORT] [INSIGHT] [LATEST]However, that could change without notice if the planet decides to speed up or slow down without warning.And the bizarre phenomenon has made it rather hard for scientists trying to model this behaviour in the future.Nick Stamatakos of the US Naval Observatory told Time and Date: ""We've tried internally modelling things for the next two or more years.""But we've run into trouble predicting more than six months or one year ahead.""Scientists are unsure what causes these long-term changes in the Earth's rotation.Sometimes they are triggered by powerful earthquakes as they can cause the Earth's mass to be rearranged.Scientists also believed the loss of ice in Greenland has contributed to the Earth slowing down as a result of meltwater moving away from the planet's poles.According to NASA, shifts in the Earth's mass can lead to variations of up milliseconds a day.Richard Gross at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory explained: ""Earth is just like a skater.""Anything that moves mass closer to the Earth's axis speeds its rotation up, and moving mass away from the axis slows it down.""",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png
"Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1 Pro, 2021) review: Return of the Mac - Pocket-lint
That led to a number of competitors trying to muscle in with viable alternatives for creative professionals keen to get work done while out on the road. Apple's response? Two new MacBook Pro models with new displays, new processors, the removal of the Touch Bar, and a whole host of ports are back once more.So has Apple righted the wrongs of its MacBook Pro recent past, or has trying to address previous trials and tribulations meant new problems have crept in as a result? We've been using the 2021 MacBook Pro 14-inch, complete with M1 Pro processor, to find out...The MacBook Pro is still a grey aluminium slab, but its 2021 design is much squarer in form and approach, losing those receding curves and thin edges of old. The move to a 14-inch display also means it's become a bigger and heavier device - or there's a bigger-still 16-inch model also available if you want to go supersize.Thanks to the reduction of the bezel around the screen - and the introduction of a notch, yes you read that right - the overall increase in size is barely noticeable though. We were still able to use a number of soft laptop pouches and bags in the office that we use for an older 13-inch MacBook Pro model with no issues. The MacBook Pro now sits on four fairly substantial feet - which could easily be mistaken for lenses on the back of an iPhone - and that raises the laptop up off any surface you're working from. This will be for better heat dissipation - not that we've felt this MacBook Pro get overly hot in its new M1 Pro processor form - and the need for enhanced cooling is further found in three large vents on the base of the casing. There's one vent at the back beneath the screen hinge that expels air, while two side vents suck air in. Although we've yet to experience any problems, those two side vents do concern us. The slits measure 3mm x 100mm and do not, from what we can see, feature any protective meshing to stop dust, dirt, sand, or other detritus, from getting in. If you're planning on this workhorse being used on location where the environment isn't always as pristine as your office might be, that might be a problem without further protection. Put simply, the laptop isn't as sealed as previous models. What's also very different from any MacBook Pro released since 2016 is the addition of various ports to make connecting to your devices easier - much easier. It's like stepping into the past while stepping into the future, as the ports are well and truly back.On one side of the chassis you'll find a MagSafe charging socket (yes, the dedicated charging port returns), two Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. On the other side there's the HDMI 2.0 port (not 2.1 though), another Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) port, and something photographers will cheer at - an SD card slot. The ports are closely packed in, but there are USB-C options on both sides to help if you're needing to charge and use a dongle at the same time. That's the benefit of having a dedicated charging port, but the USB-C ports can be used for charging if that's all you have to hand - they're just not as speedy at topping up as MagSafe is all.Open up the lid and it's all change here too. The Touch Bar has been ditched - it was supposedly loved by many, but clearly not enough to warrant it staying - and in its place is a row of physical full-sized function keys, giving you quick access to all the relevant controls you need, such as volume and screen brightness adjustment.For coders the ESC key is now one-and-a-half size, making it even easier to press, and even the Touch ID button (which remains) is bigger and easier to use for rapid fingerprint login. The keyboard itself is set in a double-anodised black well. It's smart, but does still suffer from light leakage from the black-lit keys. The trackpad remains the same large size.The display is completely new for the MacBook Pro, but not new to Apple. The 2021 MacBook Pro comes with a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR mini LED display.It offers great contrast and the usual array of Apple's display technologies - including P3 wide colour gamut, up to 1600 nits of peak brightness, and True Tone adaptive colour correction - while ProMotion 120Hz fast-refresh tech comes to the MacBook Pro for the first time.If all that sounds familiar it's because it is the same screen technology that powers the iPad Pro range, and the results are breathtaking - whether you are working on a video edit, correcting photos, watching your favourite TV show on the go, or merely surfing the web. Apple's ProMotion display makes everything on the screen considerably smoother, especially if you're fast scrolling or dealing with lots of movement. Its ability to change the refresh rate when needed means you'll potentially save battery life too. The 14.2-inch display is able to fit into the new model because of a reduction in the bezel that surrounds the display. It's now considerably thinner all around, but there's a catch: the new 1080p FaceTime HD camera is bigger than the bezel it sits within, resulting in a notch that iPhone X or later users will be familiar with. Yes: a notched screen on a laptop.If that sounds complicated or awkward it's actually not. The notch sits within the menu bar at the top of the screen and although you can lose the mouse pointer behind it, you can't place any window behind it even if you go into full-screen mode. It doesn't interfere with full-screen videos either, and if you opt for a darker desktop wallpaper or work with full-screen apps, the chances are you won't even notice it.Why has Apple done it then? It's really all about getting more screen space and using what was previously bezel for the menu bar instead, sitting left and right of the notch.Apple's move to its own silicon moves up a gear with the introduction of the M1 Pro and M1 Max processors. The M1 Pro claims to be twice as fast as the M1 that launched in 2020, while the M1 Max is twice as fast again.The 14-inch MacBook Pro comes in two off-the-shelf options: there's an entry-level M1 Pro with 8-core CPU and 14-core GPU, or (as reviewed) an M1 Pro with a 10-core CPU and 16-Core GPU. Those who need more power can upgrade to the M1 Max - but upgrading can get pricey pretty quickly. Both 14-inch models come with 16GB unified memory as standard. That can also be upgraded to 32GB (as reviewed). There's also a 64GB option, but that requires the M1 Max.Unified memory, first introduced alongside the M1 processor, allows the system memory to be shared where needed rather than siloed for the graphics or the processor. It's a much more efficient way of doing things and means that once an app or game loads it can access all that memory to use for itself.In the case of a video editing package, for example, it means there's considerably more memory to work with compared to previous MacBook Pro models. The 2020 model had 8GB-to-16GB of unified memory available. The 2019 model (so pre-M1) had up to 32GB RAM and 4GB devoted to the graphics card.So you can see why creative professionals will be excited by the prospect of a 64GB option. It'll mean the opportunity to open huge files that were previously inaccessible when on the go.All that power, combined with faster SSDs - which by the way are upgradable up to 8TB, yes eight terabytes - means working with large files shouldn't pose a problem. And from what we've tested nothing seems to faze the 14-inch MacBook Pro. This machine laughs in the face of big files and demanding apps. In testing, a 31GB cinema 4D file opens almost instantly and allows you to render effects in real-time. We couldn't even open it on our M1-powered 13-inch model. Likewise, a 1594 track Pro Logic file opens in less than 20 seconds. Those wanting to edit video on the go shouldn't have a problem either. The M1 Pro can handle up to 20 streams of 4K ProRes footage at the same time, while the M1 Max can handle 30 streams.And the power-crazy specs don't stop there. The M1 Pro models allow you to connect up to two Pro Display XDRs, while the M1 Max can drive up to three Pro Display XDRs and a 4K TV. Elsewhere there's a three-mic array for recording audio and a six-speaker soundsystem that supports Apple's Spatial Audio. It sounds considerably better than previous MacBook Pro models, and is more than good enough to playback projects you're working on or merely when it comes to the end of the day and you fancy watching a show or movie.All that power requires plenty of battery - and the MacBook Pro 14-inch seems to have it in spades. It's partly why the unit is a further 200g heavier than the 13.3-inch model. There's potential for up to 17 hours of full-screen video playback - which is seven more than the 13-inch model - or 11 hours of wireless web browsing. Of course those battery-life times vary depending on what you do with the machine, but we've happily got a day's use from the battery doing a combination of heavy and light tasks. You can recharge the battery via one of the three Thunderbolt 4 sockets, as MacBook Pro users have done since 2016, or via the new included braided MagSafe charging cable in the box - which allows you to access fast-charging tech.However, fast charging for the 14-inch model is only possible using the much larger 96W charger. The entry-level configuration doesn't include this in the box (it's the standard 67W one), so you'll have to add it as an accessory if you want it. Higher-level configurations do include the 96W charger as standard, though, so that's something to keep an eye on.That fast charging is worth it though. You'll get from zero to 50 per cent in just under 30 minutes - a number we can vouch for.

Apple's macOS gets an update too. Now on version 12, or Monterey, the operating system brings with it a number of new features - and many that come across from the iPhone and iPad. That includes features like better FaceTime controls, Focus, Quick Notes, changes to Safari, Shortcuts, and Universal Control when it eventually launches later this year. Unlike a new iPhone or Apple Watch there aren't any exclusive MacBook Pro software enhancements. But this new 14-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Pro or M1 Max processor sees Apple throw out the playbook it has been using since 2016 and go back to basics, back to the Mac of 2015 and before, almost as if the last few years haven't even existed.Unlike the MacBook Pro models of recent times, this isn't a device that's merely there to enjoy surfing the web or writing the odd document - that's what the MacBook Air is for - this is a machine that wants to be pushed to the limit. If you opt to customise the configuration even further then you'll be hard pushed to hit that limit too.However, we do have concerns that those side air vents will cause problems in the long run, are surprised there is no Face ID support in the new notch, and wish there was a SIM card slot for 5G connectivity.Overall the 2021 MacBook Pro is one super-powered machine that we suspect many pros will be clambering to have in their creative arsenal. Because Apple has put the pro back in the MacBook Pro and found its purpose with this series once again.The bigger 16-inch model to this 14-inch version. It offers an identical experience apart from the bigger screen size and battery capacity. If you really need that big machine on the go, this is the one to go for. The M1-powered 13-inch model delivers a smaller device with fewer ports, at a smaller price tag. It's still a very capable machine though.If the new MacBook Pro 14-inch model sounds too powerful and well, too 'pro', then the MacBook Air might be the better option. More geared towards consumers who are just there to surf the web and do the odd bit of photo editing, it too is still a very capable machine - just nowhere near to the levels of the M1 Pro machines.", https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1583248045.jpg,"Look how far Halo Infinite has come in these comparison shots from 2019 and 2021 - Gamesradar

Activision - which remains mired in a messy legal battle following the state of California's lawsuit alleging sexual discrimination, harassment and a ""frat boy"" culture at Blizzard - has shared a handful of new Call of Duty: Vanguard details ahead of the WW2 shooter's launch next week.All the new information comes via the PlayStation Blog, in which Vanguard developer Sledgehammer offers  alongside a look at four Operators, complete with introductory trailers for each.Two of the Operators - Cameroonian-British paratrooper Sgt. Arthur Kingsley and Soviet sniper Lt. Polina Petrova, both playable in Vanguard's single-player and multiplayer modes - have been seen before, but Sledgehammer has also now revealed two new multiplayer-only Operators, Daniel Take Yatsu and Padmavati Balan, explaining how each fits into the narrative world.Call of Duty: Vanguard - Padmavati Balan Intro.The more practical information comes in Sledgehammer's second PlayStation Blog post, which details how Call of Duty: Vanguard will make use of the PlayStation 5 DualSense wireless controller's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.Sledgehammer says its goal when utilising DualSense was to ""simulate the trigger weight of real-world weapons"", and, to that end, there are several stages to each trigger pull in Vanguard. The ""take-up"" is the distance a trigger travels once a player starts to press it; the ""break"" is the point at which a shot is fired once a correct amount of pressure is applied; ""over-travel"" is how far the trigger pulls after the break point, and lastly there's the ""trigger reset"", which stops automatic firing and resets the break.""It's at the 'break' stage that the DualSense controller's adaptive triggers apply varying degrees of feedback to help create the feeling of weight on the trigger,"" explains Sledgehammer. ""This feedback is applied differently for different weapons, creating a more accurate sense of trigger weight for each. For instance, if you're running around with a 1911 sidearm you'll feel a moderate amount of tension as you get to the break point, but it won't hold the same weight as that M1 Garand marksman rifle"".Call of Duty: Vanguard - Daniel Take Yatsu Intro.""The feedback applied by the DualSense controller doesn't just impact the firing trigger in Vanguard,"" Sledgehammer continues, ""but the scope trigger as well, meaning the downsight speed and L2 trigger weight changes based upon what weapon you're wielding. For example. heavy weapons will feel heavy, lighter weapons will feel light, and everything in between. Plus, the attachments you have on your weapon will play a role in this as well, so it's a factor to consider as you're making your selections.""All this comes into play alongside haptic feedback support, which Sledgehammer says will ""add to the visceral experience of global warfare"". Call of Duty: Vanguard will be available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, PlayStation 4, and PS5 next Friday, 5th November.",https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2018/internalforum/users/oli/1521645425.jpg/EG11/thumbnail/192x192/quality/50/format/jpg,"AirPods 3 review: AirPods advance closer to Pro sibling - What Hi-Fi?
While better-sounding alternatives exist, the AirPods 3 are daily delights with a strong selling point in spatial audioApple hardly needs any ‘third time lucky’ well wishes for its new AirPods 3. It’s estimated that around 200 million pairs of the true wireless earbuds have been sold in the four years since their arrival – roughly half the number of official Rubik’s Cubes (the best-selling toy ever) that have been sold over four decades, to put it in perspective.While brand affinity has naturally played its rather large part in this, there’s no denying the AirPods’ success has also been down to Apple’s flawless ‘it just works’ technology – and the third-generation AirPods are the latest incarnation of that ethos, with a stand-out feature thrown in as a final flourish.Here, Apple has brought its ‘standard’ wireless earbuds much more in line with the premium AirPods Pro, which remain superior over the AirPods in fewer ways now than before. Such evolution basks in an air of both inevitability and sensibility, but how does that fare against the increasing – and increasingly good – competition that has upped its game in desperation to take what’s left of the AirPods-dominated market?The AirPods 3’s price of £169 ($179, AU$279) is slightly higher than the launch price of their predecessors, which remain current in the line-up with an official price drop to £119 ($129, AU$219) – the price they’ve actually been available at for some time. That makes the new AirPods middle-sitters in Apple’s three-strong true wireless earbuds range, below the AirPods Pro, which are now officially £239 ($249, AU$399) with the new inclusion of a MagSafe wireless charging case.The true wireless earbuds market seems to have somewhat settled on a price division in recent times, with models without noise-cancelling around and below the £120 ($150, AU$250) mark and those with noise-cancelling above that, up to the AirPods Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4 and  of this world. That makes the AirPods 3 appear expensive in the non-noise-cancelling segment, but then again none of the rival AirPods alternatives – the , for example – have quite the flurry of features, especially for Apple device owners.Unsurprisingly, the new AirPods, like their Pro and Max siblings, don’t support the lossless (CD-quality and above) audio now offered in the Apple Music catalogue, due to the inherent restrictions of their AAC Bluetooth codec support. While there’s certain controversy to that technological conflict that will likely hang over Apple’s head until it launches compatible headphone hardware, it seems unfair to talk about what features the AirPods 3 overlook considering they take advantage of so many – including Apple’s arguably buzziest audio innovation in years. Spatial audio arrived for movies and TV shows as part of iOS 14 in September 2020, and this summer expanded to music through its alliance with Dolby Atmos. For the uninitiated, Spatial audio uses 3D audio algorithms, applying directional audio filters to subtly adjust the frequencies that each ear receives, so that sounds are placed all around the soundstage to create a more immersive effect.Battery life 30 hoursWater resistance IPX4Features spatial audio, Audio Sharing, MagSafe wireless chargingBluetooth AAC, 5.0Weight 4.3g (each bud), 38g (case)The ambush scene in the first episode of the Jason Mamoa-starring dystopian thriller is much more involving when the sound is ‘spatialised’ – the soundstage opens up so that falling boulders sound more dramatic, and even the extra envelopment of heavy rainfall makes for a more compelling audiovisual experience. Similarly, in the final scene of the second episode of Invasion, where army troops get trapped in a storm of debris, it’s a much more claustrophobic and affecting experience with spatial audio activated. Our appreciation of the technology with music isn’t quite as blanket. Surround processing effects can naturally sacrifice the focus of vocals, and while that isn’t obvious with the films we try, it’s more apparent with music. We spend hours delving into Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio tracks – from Kraftwerk and Lorde to Ludovico Einaudi and the Beatles – and find ourselves preferring stereo presentations for some, spatial audio for others. You lose some of the directness, immediacy and often musicality that the stereo presentation delivers, but in return, especially when tracks are mixed well, you can get a truly unique (and sometimes exceptional) atmospheric boost from the immersive surround-sound mix that’s much more than a gimmick – just as you can with Atmos tracks on Tidal.More familiar AirPods features also return, powered by the same H1 chip – although the AirPods do require Apple devices running the now available iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, watchOS 8.1, tvOS 15.1, or macOS Monterey.Audio Sharing, which allows an Apple device's audio to be played simultaneously through two sets of AirPods, Pro or Max, is present and correct, as is the commonplace auto-pause function. The AirPods now take advantage of the Pro's Adaptive EQ feature too, meaning the earbuds adapt their sound in real-time based on how they fit in your ear.Apple has also worked to improve voice call quality, firstly by bringing in support for a codec called AAC-ELD, specifically designed to enhance speech, and secondly by covering the beamforming microphones on the earbuds with an acoustic mesh in an effort to reduce wind noise.Apple could’ve kept the AirPods 2’s 24-hour battery life and remained largely competitive in today’s market, but it has taken it to an above-par (albeit not class-leading) 30 hours: the buds themselves now offer six hours (up from five) and the charging case is able to re-juice them four times before needing a charge itself via the Lightning connector. Just note that the earbud battery figure will take a slight hit depending on volume level and if spatial audio is deployed. Handily, a five-minute ‘quick charge’ should be enough for an extra hour of juice, too.The one available charging case, compatible with MagSafe wireless chargers, harks back to the original AirPods – curvaceous and squarish, and noticeably narrower than the Pro’s. We’re pleased Apple has not only made the earbuds IPX4-rated water and sweat resistant but also, for the first time, given the charging case that same level of protection against water splashes.The buds themselves also take their cues from an existing AirPods design – the Pro. As was consistently rumoured in the long build-up to their reveal, the AirPods 3 ditch those ludicrously long, earring-like stems in favour of the shorter stems of their noise-cancelling sibling.The buds are very slightly and imperceptibly smaller in every dimension and a single gram lighter too. They have subtly different contouring, but the biggest difference is their omission of the Pro’s interchangeable silicone ear tips, which we prefer for their secure fit and seal. The natural unintrusiveness of the AirPods design will be welcome to those who don’t like their ears being stuffed with silicone, but the fit isn’t for everyone. Most people on our reviews team got on with it like a house on fire, some complained that after a while their inner-ear cartilage felt like it was on fire.With the neater stems come the same touch controls, courtesy of force sensors on the stems that can be gently squeezed to control music playback and calls. While the AirPods 2 required a double-tap on the earbuds’ body to play music, skip forward tracks or answer a phone call, the AirPods 3’s controls are more versatile and mirror those of the Pro – squeeze the stem once to play, pause or answer a phone call, twice to skip forwards, and thrice to skip backwards. Instead of a press-hold action switching between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode in the Pro, here it activates Siri.Our time with the Pro over the past two years has seen us grow more comfortable with the stem-squeeze motion, which is just as responsive here. But we stick by our initial comments that we wish the controls were less involved – squeezing stems isn’t easy to perform when exercising, for example. We’re more disappointed that on-bud volume adjustment remains on the wishlist.New features, new design – and new sound? There’s certainly a genetic likeness between the AirPods 3 and their predecessor where sonic character is concerned: the new ""low distortion"" driver has also been tuned to produce an easygoing balance that doesn’t unduly favour any part of the frequency spectrum. Like many of us in the past two years, though, the new AirPods have taken on extra weight – they’re now slightly fuller in general, with a bolder bass and smoothed out top end sandwiching a lush midrange. That bottom end is more shapely and precise too, giving basslines a sharper kick and helping to will them along.The leap from second to third generation is defined by greater clarity and cleanliness, too – everything in the presentation is that bit more present and organised – and Apple has been sure to make headway in terms of insight too. It’s evolution over revolution, but that is OK. We’re fans of their neutrality and clarity, and the AirPods sound better than the cheaper crop of ANC-less competition. We still find they fall victim to harshness and congestion when their volume is pushed, although that isn’t uncommon in the market.The Pro are still the best-sounding AirPods, mind you, with more space and dynamic expression making for a more compelling delivery. The also-premium, also noise-cancelling Sony WF-1000XM4 take that even further as the market class leaders by being significantly subtler in their delivery and, courtesy of a tighter handle on rhythms, more musical. And it’s worth noting that the older WF-1000XM3 (still available and cheaper than the AirPods at the time of writing) come out sonically on top against both pairs of Apple buds too.In their third generation, the AirPods are very much familiar faces but ones that have a new hair-do or job promotion glow about them, thanks to their improved sound, innovative Apple-centric features and Pro-inspired redesign.The AirPods Pro still justify their existence with superior sound, ANC and fit-friendly eartips. And you have to believe that the increased parity between the models now won’t last too long anyway, with Apple expected to next year launch a second-gen Pro which will undoubtedly pull away once more, as it should, from the standard model that has now sidled up fairly close to it.The AirPods 3 aren’t the best-sounding earbuds out there and are pretty pricey for a pair without active noise-cancelling in today’s competitive market. They won’t be for everyone fit-wise either, and of course they still hugely favour Apple device owners. But generally, third time proves a charm here. The new model is bound to continue the AirPods sales’ upwards trajectory towards Rubik’s Cube popularity, and we can’t say it doesn’t deserve to.SCORESMORE:Read our Sony WF-1000XM4 reviewThese are the best AirPods alternativesWhat Hi-Fi?, founded in 1976, is the world's leading independent guide to buying and owning hi-fi and home entertainment products.

YesterdayApple released today HomePod 15.1 Software with the long-awaited Lossless and Dolby Atmos support. While both the HomePod and HomePod mini support Lossless, if you want to listen to Spatial Audio with the HomePod mini, there’s a hidden workaround…
In June, when Apple first released Lossless and Dolby Atmos support, it said that in 2021, both HomePod and HomePod mini would offer these new capabilities. After the WWDC21 keynote, the company started testing HomePod 15 Software, and 9to5Mac .When iOS 15 and all the other systems were released, the company pushed back Lossless and Dolby Atmos support for its smart speakers because the features weren’t ready. Then, with HomePod version 15.1 Software beta, Apple started testing these features again and now it’s finally releasing them. Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as it appears.For example, the original HomePod can play songs in Lossless and with Spatial Audio enabled even if you only have one speaker. HomePod mini can play songs in Lossless, but it doesn’t support Spatial Audio.At 9to5Mac, we conducted a few tests trying to stream in Dolby Atmos with a pair of HomePod mini speakers, but Apple Music didn’t show the toggle of “Dolby Atmos,” only “Lossless.” Not only that but Apple’s release notes also make clear that the HomePod mini can’t play Spatial Audio, except if you connect them to the Apple TV…So, the tweak is: if you connect a pair of HomePod mini to the Apple TV 4K, you’re able to stream Spatial Audio songs – and they do sound as they’re using this feature.Although it’s unclear whether this is a bug or Apple intended it this way, the only way to stream Spatial Audio with a HomePod mini is with a pair connected to your Apple TV. It’s also important to note that with HomePod 15 Software and tvOS 15, the company released HomePod mini support as Apple TV speakers.To check if these features are enabled in your device running iOS 15.1 and HomePod 15.1, follow these steps:How do you like Lossless and Spatial Audio in your HomePod?

"COP26: Sir David Attenborough warns world leaders must act now or 'it'll be too late' for planet - Sky News
Sir David Attenborough has warned world leaders must act now on climate change or ""it'll be too late"" for the planet.He added it would be ""really catastrophic"" to ignore the issue.His comments come ahead of the , which starts on Sunday and has been billed as the last best chance to keep global temperature rises to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.In conversation with BBC science editor David Shukman, the veteran broadcaster said: ""Every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects.""He added: ""If we don't act now, it will be too late. We have to do it now.""The 95-year-old said wealthier western countries have a ""moral responsibility"" to help refugees displaced by climate change.""We caused it - our kind of industrialisation is one of the major factors in producing this change in climate. So we have a moral responsibility,"" he told the BBC during filming for his new series, The Green Planet, which will air on BBC1 next year.""Even if we didn't cause it, we would have a moral responsibility to do something about thousands of men, women and children who've lost everything, everything.""Can we just say goodbye and say this is no business of ours?""Sir David will be present at the summit and has previously been a vocal critic of those who deny climate change.Earlier in October, he said the possibilities of COP26 gave him ""some hope"".""For the first time people around the world will hear the arguments as to what we should do, the analyses as to what the problems are and what the solutions are,"" he said.""Those two things bring me some hope.""However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""very worried"" the conference , admitting it is ""touch and go"".When answering questions from school children around the world, he said: ""It is going to be very, very tough this summit.""I am very worried because it might go wrong and we might not get the agreements that we need and it is touch and go, it is very, very difficult, but I think it can be done.""Watch the Daily Climate Show at 6.30pm Monday to Friday on Sky News, the Sky News website and app, on YouTube and Twitter.The show investigates how global warming is changing our landscape and highlights solutions to the crisis.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/06/768x432/skynews-david-attenborough_5418009.jpg?20210617115536,"Insulate Britain protester winces in pain as he glues his face to road - Metro.co.uk
An eco-protester who wanted to take ‘extreme action’ to send a message admits he regrets gluing his face to the road in central London.Matthew Tulley was one of 52 people arrested during yesterday’s Insulate Britain demonstration during rush hour. He winced as his face was stuck to the road in the City of London, and admitted: ‘It wasn’t one of my better moves.’ The protest in the capital prompted the granting of a temporary nationwide injunction covering the ‘entire strategic road network’. It means protesters who do continue to blockade the roads could face an unlimited fine or two years in prison for contempt of court. Although previous High Court injunctions issued for key motorways such as the M25 have not been enough to deter all demonstrators. Yesterday’s protest brought parts of the City of London and Canary Wharf to a standstill, as activists demanded all homes in the UK are properly insulated as a way of fighting climate change. Speaking with his face glued to the road, Tulley told the Telegraph: ‘It was to make a statement that things are fairly critical, and so I was wanting to have an extreme action to reflect the extreme nature of the emergency that we’re facing.’People had to use scissors to cut off his hair that remained stuck to the world. The protester added: ‘It wasn’t one of my better moves’. Asked if he was worried if he would ‘snip himself’ while being cut free, he added: ‘Well you’ll find out if there’s blood coming out.’Tulley runs South Yorkshire-based company Solid Carbon Storage and has admitted on the company’s YouTube channel to being a fan of Insulate Britain – an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion. Yesterday’s demonstration marked the 14th time that the group had caused disruption on motorways or A roads in London over the past six weeks. Insulate Britain warned last Friday that they would resume their road blockades this week.More than 100 protesters have already been served with court papers in relation to these injunctions, the Department for Transport said.On Friday, National Highways made nine applications to the High Court against protesters who had breached an existing injunction by blocking the M25, suggesting the orders are not acting as much of a deterrent. Yesterday Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted: ‘Insulate Britain are back, risking lives & ruining journeys. 3 specific injunctions are already in place, but today I instructed @NationalHways to apply for an injunction covering the entire strategic road network.‘Tonight this has been granted on a temp basis by the High Court. The long term solution lies in changes to the Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill, giving additional powers against disruptive protests which target critical national infrastructure.‘This includes unlimited fines & prison sentences of up to 6 months for obstructing highways.’

Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) that found the level of service provided over the weekend when they went missing was below the standard that it should have been.Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman taken from Bibaa’s phone shortly before they were killed (Met Police/PA)The force said no misconduct was found by an officer and two members of police staff but there will be action taken over their performance, which was found to be inadequate.There was no suggestion racial bias played any part in how the missing persons reports were dealt with, it added.Smallman said the taking of the photos, which showed the faces of her daughters, “dehumanised” her children and she feared that they could be posted on the internet: “They were nothing to them and what’s worse, they sent them on to members of the public.”Met Commissioner Cressida Dick said: “My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Nicole and Bibaa for their tragic losses.“The way we responded to information that Nicole and Bibaa were missing that weekend was below the standard we should have achieved and compounded the distress felt by their loved ones.“While we know that very sadly Nicola and Bibaa had been murdered in the early hours of Saturday June 6 2020, before they were reported missing, if we had responded better we may have saved their friends and family immeasurable pain.“I am very sorry that the level of service we provided fell short.“We have contacted the family to ask if they will allow me or, if they prefer, another senior officer to visit them at a time that is right to apologise in person.”The IOPC investigation found that the inspector closed the police logs after receiving information about the sisters’ possible whereabouts from a family member, but that information was “inaccurately” recorded by a communications supervisor.This meant that missing persons inquiries for both women were not progressed properly.As a result of the IOPC investigation, an inspector, from the North West Command, and a member of police staff, a communications supervisor attached to Met Command and Control at Lambeth, must undertake “unsatisfactory performance procedures”, the Met said.They will both attend formal meetings to discuss their performance and appropriate action, while a second member of police staff, a call handler based at Met Command and Control at Hendon, will receive “management action”, meaning they will have a performance discussion with their line manager around what they can learn from the case and how they can improve.The inspector told the investigation that this had been one of “the most challenging shifts of his career” with 16 missing persons reports open and the North West Command Unit under capacity by almost 50 per cent due to the ongoing pandemic.The Met said following the investigation several members of staff must subsequently undertake “unsatisfactory performance procedures.”The IOPC investigation had also considered whether the force’s response had been affected by the sisters’ ethnicity, the Met added.“After a comprehensive examination of police records, no evidence was found of stereotyping or biased assumptions based on the sisters’ race or where they lived,” it said.“The IOPC also recommended we review the processes and separate computer systems used by different call handlers, and consider whether further training should be provided to ensure all fully understand how systems operate that they might not use as frequently.“We have already addressed this recommendation by producing an enhanced training information pack for all call operators.”In August, family and friends of the sisters staged at a vigil at the scene of the incident on what would have been Ms
