"Roy Keane claims six Man Utd stars should never play for club again in post-Man City rant - Express
Manchester United legend Roy Keane claims there are up to six Red Devils players who should never play for the club again. Keane unleashed a furious rant on his former side following their 4-1 loss to Manchester City on Sunday.City led 2-1 at half-time after a competitive first half at the Etihad.But once Riyad Mahrez had scored the hosts' third goal, it was cruise control.Mahrez added a fourth deep into second-half stoppage time on a dismal day for Ralf Rangnick's side.Former United right-back Gary Neville claimed on commentary that the players had given up after City's third.And Keane agreed with his old team-mate, claiming the end of the game was ""unforgivable"".Keane said on Sky Sports: ""I think the worst thing you can say about United, Gary mentioned it, is they gave up. For a player in a derby, in any game, to give up is unforgivable.""We saw all of United’s shortcomings today. There are ways to lose football matches, we've all lost football matches, but the way United lost the game today they stopped running, they gave up, players not running back.""The manager will be criticised and the tactics but players not running back when you're playing for Man United it's really unacceptable, it really is. They threw the towel in, which is shameful.""DON'T MISS [OPINION] [SOCIAL] [REPORT]Keane then said how there was a large number of the players on show on Sunday that shouldn't play for United again but he didn't name the individuals.He continued: ""I was getting really frustrated watching it. I can forgive mistakes but you've got to run back.""There were players, five or six players, and I was thinking they should never play for Man United again. Just shameful, shameful that you can't run back, that you can't put your body on the line.""United's midfield pairing of Fred and Scott McTominay were two at the brunt of Keane's criticism.On City's second goal, Keane said: ""Look at Fred, you’ve got a midfielder stood there like he’s waiting for a bus, your instinct has to go back towards your own goal and defend, [Victor] Lindelof and [Harry] Maguire sure, but Fred, he’s just stood there!""And on Mahrez's late clincher, the Irishman added: ""Look at McTominay, he seems an honest enough kid but at this level.""Tackle him! Get up against him and take him (Mahrez) out! That comes from within, not the staff or managers, it should be in your DNA as a player.""Keane admitted there was not much else Rangnick could have done to change the outcome of the match.He says the blame lays at the door of the players but doesn't want to see them come out apologising for the result in the coming days.""It’s no good having moments in games, the match is 90 minutes long you’ve got to do it all game long,"" he continued.""I don't think the manager could’ve done too much differently but by the time the substitutes came on, the fight was over.""I don’t know who’s running that dressing room. Look at Maguire, he had a poor game, is he having battles with Ronaldo, captaincy and all these things?""Egos come into it, you leave egos at the front door, these guys are all about how am I looking? Are my boots nice? Is my hair looking good? Play the game!""You’re at Man United, we’re looking at the fans behind the goal and they know, they’re not daft, this team we’re supporting have given up.""We’ll hear a load of rubbish over the coming days, we’ve heard it before, there’ll be statements, ‘sorry about that, we’ll try it again next week’, it’s what you do on the pitch that interests me, not all the other garbage.""",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Cristiano Ronaldo complained of injury and flew to Portugal AFTER hearing he was benched for Man Utd’s d... - The Sun
CRISTIANO RONALDO complained of a hip injury and flew to Portugal — after being axed from Manchester United’s team for their derby defeat.The superstar was stunned to be told by boss Ralf Rangnick he would not be starting against Man City.Rangnick said he wanted fresh legs for the match and that he believed Ronaldo could make an impact from the bench.But the United legend insisted he could do that from the start and was furious at being axed.It is believed he hopes to help his injury with warm weather in his homeland.SunSport understands his team-mates were surprised he  on Saturday night.The 37-year-old had been feeling positive in training last week and was looking forward to the Etihad clash with City.But United interim-boss Rangnick was told by the club’s medical department on Friday that Ronaldo had a hip flexor injury.After , Rangnick insisted: “I have to believe my medical department.“Our doctor came to see me Friday morning before training and said Cristiano could not train because of some problems with his hip flexor and the same Saturday.”Striker Edinson Cavani was also missing after apparently not feeling well enough to play after his recent groin problem.Asked when they would return, Rangnick said: “I don’t know. I was hoping to have them available for this game.“We have two important games coming up against Spurs and Atletico and we have to focus on that.”Rumours began to swirl on social media on Saturday night that Ronaldo had pulled out of the squad.The Instagram account that started the rumour is cr7.0_lendario — which is followed by Ronaldo.A post claimed: “Manchester United’s manager wants to enter with a different strategy in tomorrow’s game and has chosen to defend himself more, a purely tactical choice.

Get the latest Celtic news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter Kieran Tierney is the centre of a bust-up south of the border after reportedly offering to meet Watford's Chucho Hernandez 'outside' after Arsenal 's 3-2 win over the Hornets.  Tierney and his Gunners teammates emerged the victors from the Premier League match at Vicarage Road winners and moved back into fourth, a Champions League spot.  The former Celtic left-back wore the captain's armband for the final 11 minutes and appeared in a fiery mood when locked in battle.  After one Watford attack, the man from Muirhouse walked over to the touchline to take a throw-in. Tierney was in no rush to take the throw and Hernandez flung the ball at the defender to hurry things along. Tierney dropped to the floor and this only served to anger Hernandez further, with his Watford teammates trying franticly to calm him down.It was here, according to the Daily Mirror, Arsenal's stand-in skipper offered to meet his foe 'outside' post-match.

Mikel Arteta claims that Bukayo Saka's penalty heartache for England at Euro 2020 may have had a positive impact on the 20-year-old... with Arsenal now reaping the benefits.  Saka was a pivotal figure in the Gunners' win at Watford as he scored one and assisted another in the 3-2 victory at Vicarage Road.  The Arsenal academy graduate linked up well with Martin Odegaard for the Norwegian midfielder's opener before turning goal-scorer when Saka restored his side's lead after Watford had initially equalised.  Another promising Arsenal youngster in Gabriel Martinelli added Arsenal's third in stellar fashion as the Brazilian lashed a thunderous right-footed effort beyond the rooted Ben Foster.  HAVE YOUR SAY!   Has Saka's emotional England experience actually helped him? Comment below  While Moussa Sissoko's late goal sparked a nervy finish for Arteta's men, Arsenal were able to hold on for what could prove to be a crucial three points come the end of the season.Saka has been in fantastic form for the majority of the league season, following a brutal finish to his Euro 2020 campaign with England. The Gunners star was the player who missed the decisive spot-kick in the penalty shootout loss to Italy last July, while Manchester United duo Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford also failed to convert from 12-yards. Following the win at the home of the Hornets, Arteta was full of praise for his number seven.""I think Bukayo had an experience in the summer that not a lot of players would ever have and I think it was great for his career because the football world showed how much they like him and how much they respect him,"" the Spaniard explained.""I think that was a big boost for him to realise in difficult moments that people are going to give him support, and the club did exactly the same as his team-mates.Arteta went on to suggest that Saka still has plenty of room to grow and is on an upward trajectory.""Then it's about giving him that space. What he is already doing is phenomenal and he needs that room. Don't read too much, do what you do.""Football is his priority in life and you can see that every day in training and he needs to continue to behave and live the way that he is doing.""

Vladimir Putin faces being stripped of control of a key energy asset in central Europe under a plan drawn up by .The oligarch Karel Komarek is to hold talks with the Czech government later this month over plans to nationalise the vast Moravia gas storage facility, half of which is owned by Gazprom, the Russian state energy colossus.Moravia is the only Russian-backed storage facility in the Czech Republic and losing it would deprive Mr Putin of a vital foothold in the region's infrastructure. It would be one of the first Western efforts to take control of a business asset owned by the Russian state.In a further sign that support for the Kremlin is ebbing away, Mr Komarek's compatriot and fellow billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, the “Czech sphinx” investor whose energy empire has ties to Russian state-owned energy companies, has today issued a public condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month.A spokesman for Mr Kretinsky, who is the co-owner of Premier League football club West Ham United and , said: “Our company and its shareholders condemn the military aggression against Ukraine.""Through our foundation we actively help with the supply of medicine and medical supplies to Ukraine. We will fully respect all agreements and economic sanctions.”The intervention is significant because his business Energeticky a prumyslovy holding (EPH) is the biggest energy company in Central Europe.It comes after British gas prices rocketed to an all-time high of more than 500p per therm - over ten times the long-term average - and Liz Truss, the British Foreign Secretary, said Western leaders had agreed to wean their economies off Russian fossil fuels following the invasion of Ukraine.Opponents of the Putin regime have long argued that Europe is too reliant on Russian gas, which makes up 40pc of the continent's imports.The war in Ukraine has sparked a race by businessmen with ties to Russia to distance themselves from the regime. Boris Johnson's spokesman has said that businesses ""should think very carefully if they are still continuing to do anything that props up the Putin regime"".Mr Komarek, whose estimated net worth of $7.8bn (£5.9bn), built his business empire in oil and gas in the 1990s following Czechoslovakia’s Velvet Revolution that led to the downfall of the communist regime. He has come to prominence in Britain over the last year after emerging as a contender to run the UK’s National Lottery.He said: “It is a senseless act of aggression that must be condemned in the strongest possible terms, and we are doing all we can to support the brave Ukrainians impacted by the barbarism of Vladimir Putin’s regime.""It is understood that Mr Komarek is in talks with officials from Czech president Milos Zeman’s administration over plans to seize control. Talks insiders said that new laws would need to be passed in the Czech Republic in order for the plant to be seized.The power struggle comes as Mr Kretinsky’s company EPH began pumping Russian gas to Ukraine through Eustream, a 2,270km pipeline that cuts through the middle of Slovakia. The company does not purchase Russian gas, but has a long term gas transmission agreement with the country.Officials at EPH are braced for EU sanctions that would force it to close the pipeline.The European Commission is planning to set a target for 80pc of storage capacity within the bloc to be filled by Sept 30, up from the current level of 29pc, so it is better able to . EU countries may also have to extend the lifetimes of coal-fired power stations. Mr Kretinsky is poised to play a key role. EPH’s assets include the coal-fired power plant Fiume Santo in Sassari, Italy, as well as Germany’s Buschhaus Power Station.Elon Musk, the American billionaire founder of electric car maker Tesla, yesterday threw his weight behind the West ramping back up its production of fossil fuels.  He said: ""Hate to say it, but we need to increase oil and gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.""In the UK, Whitehall officials are laying the groundwork for discussions with Berlin and other European importers about a significant increase in deliveries of liquified natural gas at ports across the Continent, with the aim of meeting demand next winter if supplies from Russia are cut off, the Telegraph reported last week. A spokesman for Mr Komarek said: “Mr Komarek chose to divest out of Russia some years ago.“Since 2014 Mr Komarek has been investing in Ukraine, not Russia.

"Toilet habit could be clue to deadly disease thousands don’t know they have - Daily Record
Health experts have given a stark warning to men across the country that up to 14,000 of them from Scotland and England could be living with a potentially deadly disease without realising it.  Thousands of men failed to notice or get diagnosed, issues with their prostate over the last two years, due to the pandemic. According to statistics  were down by more than 5,700 in the North West alone since the coronavirus outbreak began. Prostate cancer is thought to account for a third of those not treated for cancer compared to before the pandemic, report to Prostate Cancer UK. Symptoms usually only appear after the cancer balloons in size, however, most men surveyed by YouGov failed to identify any signs of the cancer that affects 47,500 people and causes 11,500 deaths each year.  Prostate Cancer UK have now urged men not to wait until things progress to this stage, according to Liverpool Echo. The charity’s acting chief executive Nicola Tallett said: “Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, but the pandemic has meant thousands of men have not come forward for diagnosis and could be missing out on life-saving treatment.“Although thousands of men are still being treated each month, if things don’t change soon, the number of men missing out will continue to grow.“Men have been telling us they haven’t wanted to “bother” their GP during the pandemic – particularly if they don’t have any symptoms, which is the case for most men with early prostate cancer.“This means men at higher risk of the disease are not having those vital conversations about their risk that can lead to a diagnosis.“That’s why we’re working with NHS England to raise awareness and encourage men to take our risk checker to find out more about their risk and what they can do about it.”One in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetime, with this rising to one in four for Black men.Roughly 400,000 men are currently living with and after the cancer that men over 50, Black men, or those whose father or brother had the disease are at even greater risk of.Although prostate cancer can be fatal, it is “very treatable” if caught early, and the cancer may have no impact on your length of life.Symptoms usually appear when the cancer has grown big enough to put pressure on the urethra - the tube carrying urine from the bladder.More than 58,000 people in England started treatment for prostate cancer since April 2020, and urological cancer referral rates in the country returned to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021.They urged anyone with symptoms to get checked by their doctor.People with prostates can also check their risk of getting the cancer using Prostate Cancer UK’s 30-second online risk checker.Here they can learn about their level of risk and what action they can take, including getting checked by their GP if they are at higher risk.Professor Peter Johnson, national clinical director for cancer for the NHS in England, said: “I urge you to use the Prostate Cancer UK risk checker today – it is a quick and easy way to understand your risk of prostate cancer and how you can take further action if you are at risk.“The prognosis for the people we’re yet to see will be much better the earlier we see them but we do need to see them as soon as possible.“It’s important men understand prostate cancer often doesn’t show any symptoms at an early stage, so don’t delay – check your risk now. The simple check could be lifesaving.” Check your risk using Prostate Cancer UK’s online risk checker at  #MenWeAreWithYou.

Dr Michael Mosley has revamped his Fast 800 diet to incorporate elements of a keto diet. The weight loss guru believes this is now the best plan to follow if you’re looking to lose weight as it is “safe and effective” when it comes to keeping the weight off in the long term. He also spoke about why people put on weight after following a diet and it comes down to eating enough of one thing.Many rapid weight loss plans have been criticised as being ineffective after an initial period of weight loss. The Fast 800 Keto builds on two diet trends - intermittent fasting and calorie restrictions, and the high-fat, low-carb keto diet. So is this another crash diet? Dr Michael responded: “Well, it’s a rapid weight loss diet which is not the same thing. “A crash diet is something slightly crazy, unplanned, not based on science, like the cabbage soup diet. READ MORE: “Whereas this is rapid weight loss diet based on a great deal of science and a number of studies carried out…have show that rapid weight loss - if done properly - can be much more effective and sustainable than slow and steady.” In terms of the keto element to the Fast 800 diet, Dr Michael explained: “Keto diet has been around for more than 100 years. “It’s a diet, broadly speaking, where you’re eating a very low carbohydrate diet, less than 50g a day. “And it’s relatively high fat, and when you’re doing that your body switches from burning sugar to burning fat. DON'T MISS... [PICTURES] [INSIDER] [GUIDE]“It does that by converting your fat stores into something called ketone bodies, which your body and brain then use as fuel.“It’s become very popular as a way of losing and keeping off weight, and that is largely because when you go into a state of ketosis, that suppresses a hunger hormone called ghrelin so you stop feeling hungry and stop having cravings. “The disadvantage is that you’re on a very high fat diet, which lots of people don’t want to do and it isn’t healthy in the long term.“So what I’m proposing is rather a shorter term solution, which is combined with intermittent fasting and it’s a relatively low calorie as well as a low carb diet. “And that means you can eat a reasonable amount of healthy protein and fats - I describe it as a Mediterranean style diet.”Dr Michael said adults need around 60g of protein a day - more if you’re looking to lose weight. If you aren’t eating this amount, “your body will cannibalise your muscles and your metabolic rate will go down” this meaning it is harder to lose weight or weight creeps back on. The expert added: “If you do a safe and effective rapid weight loss diet, two to three years down the road you’ll keep most of that weight off.“So the idea that rapid weight loss is crazy, is just not true. “Do it properly, and it can be very effective in the short, medium and long term.“Indeed the amount of weight you lose in the first four weeks of a diet is the best a predictor of how long you’ll keep the weight off for,” he told Australia's RN Breakfast with Patricia Karvelas. ",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"10 health conditions linked to Alzheimer's disease years before condition diagnosed - The Mirror
Researchers have linked Alzheimer's disease to 10 health conditions many years before the condition is diagnosed.The earliest associated finding is major depressive disorder, which was found nine years beforehand.Anxiety, constipation and weight loss have also been linked to the brain condition which causes brain cells to shrink.But scientists are unsure unclear whether other symptoms are risk factors, the reason for the condition developing, or early warning signs a person will develop it.Alzheimer's leads to memory loss, confusion and thinking skills worsening over a sustained period of time. And 70 percent of dementia cases are believed to be begin with Alzheimer's.  The Daily Record reports that researchers think the condition is one of the 'principal health challenges of the 21st century'. Its cause is still unknown and at present there is no cure. But the NHS says there are a few established things thought to increase your risk of developing Alzheimer's - such as increasing age, family history, untreated depression, and lifestyle factors and conditions associated with heart disease.  Appearing in The Lancet Digital Health, the Paris Brain Institute aimed to confirm well-known dementia risk factors and discover others. The research could lead to early or new interventions into the devastating condition.They analysed Alzheimer's patient information, examining data collected from 20,214 UK patients over a 24 year period and 19,458 people in France covering 21 years.The study is the first to identify constipation as a possible risk factor appearing seven years before Alzheimer's diagnosis.Researcher Thomas Nedelec from the Aramis team said: ""The connections made allowed us to confirm known associations, such as hearing problems or depression, and other less known factors or early symptoms, such as cervical spondylosis or constipation.""However, we are only reporting statistical associations. These will have to be the subject of further studies to understand the underlying mechanisms.""The question remains as to whether the health problems encountered are risk factors, symptoms, or warning signs of the disease."" In November last year The Mirror reported on a possible vaccine for the condition. Experiments on mice found the vaccine destroys rogue proteins in the brain and, in doing so, restores memory.The pioneering therapy it was claimed could revolutionise treatment, according to British and German scientists.Clinical trials on the technique, which targets soluble and highly toxic ­fragments of amyloid beta that clump into plaques, could begin in two years.And if successful a vaccine could cost £15 a shot..Professor Thomas Bayer, of Gottingen University in Germany, who is co-author of the study, said scientists adopted a different approach.They created antibody which the immune system would not recognise as 'foreign'.Co-author of the research Professor Mark Carr, of Leicester University, then said: “If these results were replicated in human trials, then it could be transformative.“It opens up the possibility to not only treat Alzheimer’s but also to potentially vaccinate against the disease before the symptoms appear.” Read More Read MoreGet email updates with the day's biggest stories",https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/32emJo6J/poster.jpg,"'Absolutely avoid': The vitamin supplement shown to increase the risk of prostate cancer - Express
Despite the billions invested into research, a cure for cancer remains out of reach. This illustrates the enormity of the challenge: cancerous cells are fiendishly difficult to stop. However, progress is afoot in understanding what drives the development of the deadly disease and some of these factors can be modified.Research has uncovered many lifestyle factors that raise the risk of cancer but one that raises a few eyebrows is vitamin E supplementation.Vitamin E helps maintain healthy skin and eyes, and strengthen the body's natural defence against illness and infection (the immune system).Most people should get all the vitamin E they need through their diet and growing evidence suggests this is a much safer approach.Studies done in the 80s and 90s suggested that vitamin E and selenium each somehow provided protection against prostate cancer.READ MORE: The  was started in 2001 to investigate the findings further.The 36,000 healthy, middle-aged volunteers were divided into four groups.Each man took two pills a day: 400 international units (IU) of vitamin E plus 200 micrograms of selenium; vitamin E plus a placebo; selenium plus a placebo; or two placebos. Neither the men nor their doctors knew who was taking what.Although SELECT was supposed to last until 2011, it was stopped three years early because neither vitamin E nor selenium were showing any benefit — and there were vague warning signs they might be doing some harm.DON'T MISS [INSIGHT] [TIPS] [ADVICE]A 2014 report in the Institute provided further clarification.Toenail clippings are a great way to measure how much selenium is in a man’s (or woman’s) body.The study showed that taking vitamin E alone raised the risk of developing high-grade prostate cancer, but only in men who started the study with low selenium levels.It also showed:“I counsel all of my patients to absolutely avoid any dietary supplements that contain selenium or vitamin E—including multivitamins,” said prostate cancer expert Doctor Marc Garnick, a clinical professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, an oncologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of Harvard’s Annual Report on Prostate Diseases.Writing in Harvard Health, the doc said: “The new data are very troubling, and emphasise that supplements can cause real and tangible harm.“Any claims of benefits from dietary supplements must be ignored unless large, controlled, and well-conducted investigations confirm such benefits—which I believe will be a very rare occurrence.”The NHS explains: ""Prostate cancer does not usually cause any symptoms until the cancer has grown large enough to put pressure on the tube that carries urine from the bladder out of the penis (urethra).""Symptoms of prostate cancer can include:These symptoms do not always mean you have prostate cancer.""Many men's prostates get larger as they get older because of a non-cancerous condition called benign prostate enlargement,"" notes the NHS.",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2

Wordle players have taken to Twitter to celebrate today’s “easy” word, with many guessing the five-letter word in just two attempts.The word game, which has taken the internet by storm since it was released in October last year, sees players guess the five-letter word of the day in six attempts or less.It was created by New York City-based software engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, but was acquired by The New York Times (NYT) in February for an undisclosed seven-figure sum.Following its acquisition, many lamented that the game had become “too hard” or even “elitist”, but the NYT later denied making any changes to its gameplay, only removing six words which could be deemed “offensive” from the word list.(Warning: Spoilers ahead)Yet, now players are saying the game may be “too easy” as many are guessing today’s word in a small number of guesses.The answer for Wordle 260 is “cloth”, which one Twitter user said was the “easiest one yet”.Another user, who guessed the word on their second try, said: “Well... huh. *That* was unexpected.”Another, who got theirs on their third try said: “Never post my Wordle score, but absolute scenes this morning.”However, not all players got the word so quickly. One user who guessed the correct answer on their fourth try said today’s Wordle was as “mechanical and dull as Wordle gets”.Another user, who got the word on their sixth attempt said they “didn’t know whether they should be proud or embarrassed”.Other users said that today’s word was “hard” and that there were “too many combinations” that some of the letters could have been. Some users were either getting the first three letters “C”, “L” and “O” or the last three, “O”, “T” and “H”.Players who got the first three letters could have put in words like cloak, clone, close or clout. Those who had the last three letters could have guessed broth, tooth, froth, sloth or booth.It comes after players took to social media yesterday to complain that the Wordle 259 answer, “brine” was one that.

"Rocket moon crash LIVE – Space junk ‘HITS moon’ at 5,800mph & China denies responsibility after SpaceX blam... - The Sun
AN OUT-OF-CONTROL rocket part the size of a school bus has likely smashed into the Moon's surface by now.According to astronomers, a rocket booster was set to hit the lunar surface at around 7.25am ET (12:25 GMT)  after spending nearly eight years tumbling through space.It was likely the first time a manmade object has crashed into another space body without being aimed there, but we won't know that it hit the Moon for sure until two satellites that orbit the Moon pass over the possible impact site and photograph any crater that resulted from the collision, the BBC reported.The rocket part was first spotted by Bill Gray, who writes the popular Project Pluto software to track near-Earth objects.He reported that the junk was a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage launched from Florida by Elon Musk's team in February 2015. However, Bill later retracted his claim and said the rocket part most likely belonged to China. China has since denied the accusation.Read our rocket moon crash live blog for the latest news and updates...What are the full moons in 2022?There are 12 full Moons to spot in 2021, each with its own unique name.Here's the full list:Nasa reveals date for Moon mission this monthNASA has revealed some very important dates for Moon missions that should be happening this year.The US space agency hopes to send a rocket around the Moon in May or June of 2022 but that all depends on the success of a 'mini mission' this month.Nasa's 2022 mission to the Moon is called Artemis 1.It will be testing out hardware so that Nasa can land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon by 2025.That crewed mission is being referred to as Artemis 3 and a lot has to happen before it can take place.Before Artemis 1 can launch, Nasa wants to do a test run this month.The test will be a full “wet” dress rehearsal on March 17.Artemis 1 isn't a crewed mission but it needs to loop around the Moon to test three key components.How wide will the crater be because of the crash?The space debris is expected to smash into the far side of the moon at approximately 5,800mph, creating a crater between 33ft and 66ft wide - enough to fit two double decker buses.However, the discarded rocket is not worrying experts too much, and astronomer Bill Gray, who first identified the collision course, has said the moon is used much more severe batterings.Writing on his blog Project Pluto, Gray said: ""Keep in mind that this is a roughly four-ton object that will hit at 2.58 km/s.""The moon is fairly routinely hit with larger objects moving in the ballpark of 10-20 km/s hence the craters.When will we get images of the crash?The only way to know exactly where the rocket hits is through images, which could be in a few weeks... or even months.NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was not in a position to observe the impact as it happened, the agency said.Impact won't be visibleThe rocket part was xpected to hit the Moon on March 4, where it will leave a crater about 65 feet in diameter on the surface but unfortunately, it won't be possible to see the impact live as the tumbling rocket part is expected to hit the Moon's far side – the part that faces away from Earth.Instead, astronomers will rely on images taken by satellites including Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to view what happens after the collision.Man-made items on the moonThere have been over , according to inventory taken by NASA in 2012.Among those items are:Gray advocated for 'simple steps'What the confusion over the wayward rocket part shows is that there should be better tracking of deep space junk, Bill Gray, who writes the Project Pluto software to track near-Earth objects, argued.""Many more spacecraft are now going into high orbits, and some of them will be taking crews to the Moon,” Gray said.""Such junk will no longer be merely an annoyance to a small group of astronomers.""""A few fairly simple steps would help quite a bit.""Who is Bill Gray?Bill Gray created the Guide astrometry program, which is used by professional and amateur astronomers all around the world to track NEOs, asteroids, minor planets, and comets.He also said in January that in early March, the top stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would crash with the Moon.The forecast sparked a whirlwind of media attention, much of it negative of Elon Musk and his private space company.Gray admitted that he made a mistake in his first identification of a piece of space debris named WE0913A by him and other astronomers in 2015, saying that the debris belongs to China.Who is Bill Gray?Bill Gray created the Guide astrometry program, which is used by professional and amateur astronomers all around the world

other astronomers in 2015, saying that the debris belongs to China.The moon has weaker gravityBecause the Moon's gravity is substantially less than Earth's due to its lower mass, you would only weigh roughly a sixth (16.5 percent) of what you would on Earth.This is how the lunar explorers were able to leap so far into the air.How many people have been on the moon?Twelve people, all as part of the Apollo program, have stepped on the Moon.Those who have walked on the moon are:As of January 2022, four of them are still alive: Aldrin, Scott, Duke, and Schmitt.Explained: How the Moon was createdThe giant-impact theory is the widely most accepted today.It proposes that the Moon formed during a collision between the Earth and another small planet, about the size of Mars.The debris from this impact collected in an orbit around Earth to form the Moon.What time did the rocket hit?Experts claim the incident occurred at 7.25am EST on the lunar far side, out of reach of ground-based observatories.Where did the rocket hit?The collision likely occurred on the far side of the Moon on Friday.The one-tonne hunk of space junk was previously traveling at around 2.6 km per second.'Intrinsic uncertainty'Professor Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics told BBC News he agrees with Gray's re-assessment that the rocket part most likely belonged to China instead.He said there is lots of ""intrinsic uncertainty"" in identifying space debris and errors in identification can occur.""We rely on a small handful of volunteers who do it on their own time,"" he explained to the BBC.""So there is limited scope for cross-checking.""What is the rocket booster?The object is probably part of a rocket that launched a small Chinese spacecraft, called Chang’e 5-T1, towards the Moon in 2014.Bill Gray, who writes the popular Project Pluto software to track near-Earth objects, originally reported that the junk was a SpaceX Falcon 9 upper stage launched from Florida in February 2015.However, Bill later retracted his claim and said the rocket part most likely belonged to China instead.China has since denied the accusation.SpaceX achievementsSpaceX's accomplishments include:When was SpaceX founded?Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known widely as SpaceX, is a Hawthorne, California-based aerospace manufacturer, space transportation services provider, and communications company.Elon Musk founded SpaceX in 2002 with the purpose of lowering space transportation costs so that Mars may be colonized.The Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, as well as various rocket engines, the Cargo Dragon, crew spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites, are all manufactured by SpaceX.Who is Elon Musk?Born June 28, 1971, Elon Musk is a business mogul and entrepreneur.He is the co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI, as well as the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer of SpaceX.Musk is also an early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc., and the creator of The Boring Company.He is the world's wealthiest individual, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires list, with an estimated net worth of roughly $224billion as of February 2022.Rocket body company, continuedBill Gray, the manager of Project Pluto, which provides both commercial and free astronomy software to amateur and professional astronomers, is one of the persons who has made the China link, per Space.com.""There really is no good reason at this point to think the object is anything other than the Chang'e 5-T1 booster,"" Gray told Inside Outer Space last month.""Anybody claiming otherwise has a pretty large hill of evidence to overcome.""What company does the rocket body belong to?The top stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that launched the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) in 2015 was first considered to be the rocket body.The object, however, is now linked to China's Long March 3C rocket, which launched China's Chang'e 5-T1 mission in 2014, according to Space.com.Chang'e 5-T1 circled beyond the moon and returned to Earth to test the Chang'e 5 lunar sample return mission's atmospheric re-entry capabilities in 2020.On behalf of the Luxembourg-based business LuxSpace, Chang'e 5-T1 carried a secondary payload of scientific equipment in the upper stage of the Long March rocket.How much space junk is there?According to the European Space Agency, there are currently 36,500 bits of space trash larger than 10cm in orbit.Deep space trash is not formally tracked by any space program or institution.Monitoring space is costly, and the hazards of high-altitude debris to people are minimal.What is space junk?Space junk is hardware abandoned from missions or satellites that do not have enough fuel or energy to return to Earth.How much did the rocket weigh?The rocket weighed three tonnes and had been traced for years.Does the rocket belong to China?Last week, China said that the rocket part is NOT theirs.Bill Gray, who writes the popular Project Pluto software to track near-Earth objects, however, still thinks it's an old rocket part from a lunar mission dating back to 2014.His claims have been backed up by Nasa and other experts.They believe it's from China’s Chang’e 5-T1 mission, which was used to test technology for bringing samples back from the Moon.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Tiny laser-propelled spaceships could travel to the far reaches of the solar system and beyond - Space.com
Miniature spaceships the size of cellphones could fly across the solar system using sails propelled by lasers, which would allow the tiny spacecraft to reach much faster speeds — and, potentially, much more distant destinations — than conventionally powered rockets, a new study finds.Current spacecraft usually take years to make trips within the solar system; for example, NASA's New Horizons probe took nearly 10 years to reach Pluto. In theory, spacecraft using conventional rockets would need thousands of years to complete an interstellar voyage. For example, Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to Earth, lies about 4.37 light-years away — more than 25.6 trillion miles (41.2 trillion kilometers), or more than 276,000 times the distance from Earth to the sun. It would take NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, which launched in 1977 and  in 2012, about 75,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri even if the probe were headed in the right direction, which it's not.Related: ?The problem with all rocket thrusters is that the propellant they carry with them has mass. Long trips require a lot of propellant, which makes spacecraft heavy, which, in turn, requires more propellant, making them heavier, and so on. Previous research has suggested that ""light sailing"" might be one of the only technically feasible ways to get a spacecraft to another star within a human lifetime. Although light does not exert much pressure, scientists have long suggested that what little pressure it does apply could have a major effect. Indeed, numerous experiments have shown that ""solar sails"" can rely on sunlight for propulsion if the spacecraft is light enough and has a large enough sail. Indeed, the $100 million Breakthrough Starshot initiative, announced in 2016, plans to launch swarms of microchip-size spacecraft to Alpha Centauri, each of them sporting extraordinarily thin, incredibly reflective sails propelled by the most powerful lasers ever built. The plan has them flying at up to 20% the speed of light, reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years.A major challenge Starshot faces is building the lasers needed for propulsion. It calls for a ground-based laser array on the order of 0.4 square miles (1 square kilometer) and as powerful as 100 gigawatts, which would be by far the most powerful laser ever made on Earth.In the new study, the researchers suggest that a more humble ground-based laser array — one that's 3.3 to 33 feet (1 to 10 meters) wide and 100 kilowatts to 10 megawatts in power — could still prove useful by sending tiny probes across the solar system, propelling them to much faster speeds than rocket engines could.""Such lasers can be built already today with a relatively small investment,"" study senior author Artur Davoyan, a materials scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Space.com. ""We do not need to wait till a 100-gigawatt laser becomes available.""Going interstellar on a reasonable timescale imposes more constraints than voyaging within the solar system. For instance, Starshot aims to send probes to another star within a human lifetime, so its spacecraft are designed to be extraordinarily lightweight — each just 0.035 ounces (1 gram) or so — to fly as fast as possible given the amount of energy they receive. Laser sails for interplanetary voyages, by contrast, do not have to be as lightweight. The scientists envision spacecraft for such trips ranging up to 3.5 ounces (100 g) or so — a mass ""comparable with that of a typical cell phone,"" Davoyan said.Whereas  that make it challenging to fit all the needed spacecraft systems and instruments into a single platform, a 3.5-ounce probe ""can easily be equipped with all the needed components, including spectrometers, accelerometers, particle detectors, cameras and so on — all the key ingredients to conduct a proper scientific mission in far reaches of space,"" Davoyan said.Furthermore, because a laser array can launch more than one probe, it could potentially send a fleet of tiny probes, each with different equipment, to a destination. ""For example, one may be a magnetometer probe, another equipped with a camera, the third serving as a particle detector,"" Davoyan said. ""We foresee that many small probes can be sent to really different destinations to do breakthrough science.""In addition, because interplanetary voyages do not require the kind of powerful lasers needed with Starshot, they also do not require large sails with the kind of extraordinary material properties needed to withstand the many demands of interstellar flight, such as not vaporizing under the light of such a powerful laser. The researchers suggested that silicon nitride or boron nitride sails about 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide should suffice for flights within the solar system.Related: —

— What is a solar sail?""Our work is a first step to fast and low-cost interplanetary and deep space missions,"" Davoyan said. ""We see that a new model for space exploration can emerge, where individual users, which typically do not have access to space, could now spend just a few thousand dollars and launch a real deep space mission.""Laser arrays on the order of 100 kilowatts are already under development by the U.S. military; in 2020, for instance, the U.S. Navy's littoral combat ship USS Little Rock . Furthermore, the cost of high-power lasers is rapidly dropping every year, driven by the need for optical telecommunications, with 1-kilowatt lasers available for less than $10,000, Davoyan noted.""Rough estimates show that [a] 1-megawatt laser beamer could be constructed with less than $100 million, which is far less than most of NASA's missions,"" Davoyan said. ""Importantly, once built, the beamer can be used and reused to launch multiple probes in different directions. Essentially, the laser beamer is an initial capital investment and, once built, serves as a launchpad. The mission cost then consists of producing probes, which, with the use of mass manufacturing, can be on the order of $100, launching probes to orbit for less than $100 per probe and then operating a mission during its useful lifetime. Therefore, overall the laser-driven approach offers very low cost for space exploration.""The scientists estimated that a 0.035-ounce laser sail with a 4-inch sail driven to speeds of about 112,000 mph (180,000 km/h) could reach Mars in 20 days, compared with the 200 days for NASA's Perseverance rover; Jupiter in 120 days, compared with five years for NASA's Juno probe; Pluto in less than three years, compared with 10 years for NASA's New Horizons craft; and 100 times the  in 10 years, compared with nearly 30 years for NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft.""The fact that we can change the way space is being explored already today with a minimal investment is truly energizing,"" Davoyan said. ""Such an approach allows almost everyone to develop and launch their own mission — something that was not possible before. It would be really exciting to see an undergraduate student sending their own science probe to, say, Jupiter.""The scientists now hope to test and prototype their ideas. ""We are also partnering with industry and government to move further some of the designs and ideas we have,"" Davoyan said. ""We believe we can make a real difference in the future of space exploration.""The scientists detailed their findings online Jan. 31 in the journal Nano Letters.Originally published on Space.com. to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

"Apple’s “Peek Performance” March event: What to expect - The Verge
Apple is poised for its first livestream event of 2022 on Tuesday, March 8th at 1PM ET. The company sent out press invitation emails for the event titled “Peek Performance,” with  Apple will announce a new third-generation iPhone SE with 5G.The iPad Air might also get a new spec bump update at the event, with upgrades to both 5G and an A15 Bionic processor, similar to last year’s iPad Mini. Another rumor suggests an  alongside a redesigned MacBook Air might be coming. New Macs, including a Mac Mini with an M1 Pro / M1 Max processor update, could also get a showing, and new iMac and Mac Pro hardware are said to be in the works — but those will likely show up later in the year. Whatever the case might be, we might see at least one of these new Macs on March 8th.That’s not all Apple might announce on Tuesday, so prime your expectations for the Apple event by reading about all the rumors and details below.The upcoming third-generation iPhone SE is expected to succeed the 2020 model as the new budget-friendly iPhone option. The first iPhone SE came out in 2016 and remained available for four years, which means the SE line is set for a quicker change of pace.According to reliable analyst and leaker Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone SE 3 will probably include the latest A15 Bionic chip, 5G with millimeter wave, 64GB base storage with 128GB / 256GB options, and retain the design and colors of the current model. Kuo  on a verified account that has remained quiet until now.Some predictions for the coming new iPhone SE:1. Mass production in Mar'22.2. Estimated shipments of 25-30 mn units in 2022.3. Storage: 64/128/256GB.4. A15 & 5G support (mmW & Sub-6 GHz).5. Casing: white, black, and red.6. Similar form factor design to current SE.The 2020 iPhone SE offered shockingly good value with the then-latest chipset, but its battery life was never the star of the show. Now that US carriers only want phones with 5G on their shelves, the battery life in a new iPhone SE would be a bigger concern — especially if the form factor remains the same. The current iPhone SE body models the iPhone 8, but its aging design language dates all the way back to 2014 with the iPhone 6.It’s also possible that the iPhone SE could borrow the form factor of the iPhone 13 Mini. Due to reports of less than expected sales of the iPhone 12 Mini, it’s rumored that the iPhone 13 Mini might be Apple’s last compact mainline phone. But just as the iPhone SE from 2016 carried on the compact design of the iPhone 5s, and the 2020 iPhone SE copied the smaller iPhone 8 design, the iPhone SE might become the new home for the Mini.There’s no word on price yet, but don’t expect to see a reduction to the starting $399 price. 5G modems are still expensive, so a starting storage option of 64GB makes sense if the price is to remain intact. Touch ID would also keep costs down if the design remains.The iPad Air received an iPad Pro-style redesign in 2020: it got flat edges, thin bezels, Apple Pencil 2 support, USB-C, and a new Touch ID sleep / wake button. But the still fresh design is already lagging behind: the iPad Mini from last year followed the design of the iPad Air but one-upped it with with the latest A15 Bionic processor and 5G data options (though just sub-6GHz and no millimeter wave support).So it makes sense for Apple to roll out an updated iPad Air with the latest A15 Bionic processor and with a 5G option — and perhaps center stage as well. And although FaceID would welcome, don’t expect any other changes.It’s possible that Apple announces a new MacBook Air with a new M2 chip at this event. The current design of the MacBook Air dates back to 2018 and was a testbed for the Apple M1 chip debut in 2020.We reviewed the current MacBook Air with M1 as one of the best laptops you could buy in 2020, with a score that was cut short of perfect only because of the less-than-stellar webcam.But it’s 2022 now, and we have freshly updated MacBook Pro designs with better screens and a better camera that you can expect the MacBook Air will soon follow. It might even come with a notch.A new Mac Mini was , but it never showed up. Right now, the only way to harness the power of the latest M1 Pro and M1 Max chips is in the latest MacBook Pro models. A new Mac Mini with the latest processor options would change that.The current Mac Mini design dates back to 2010, which was made to be just large enough to fit an optical drive. So it’s about time we get a new Mac Mini chassis, but if we don’t, then hopefully, we will at least get a “Pro” looking space gray finish again. We could even see Mac Mini split up into a pro option and a standard option that comes with a new M2 processor.Right now, there’s only one iMac option with M1 processors, but it only has a 24-inch screen option. If we don’t see new larger iMacs on Tuesday, we might see it later in the year. The iMac Pro was also discontinued a year ago, so that would make for an interesting surprise, though there haven’t been any supply chain leaks that would indicate a new version is imminent. There’s also the Mac Pro that has no M1 option yet — and while it’s rumored to be in the works, don’t hold your breath for that one on Tuesday.The last time Apple held an event in March was in 2019, a live presentation that showcased new premium Apple services like Apple TV Plus. Three years later, it’s very possible Apple could showcase new TV shows or movies like it did last September.Some speculation of the meaning of Apple’s event invite title “Peek Performance” points to the word “Peek” as the name of a VR / AR product. While Apple’s long-rumored headset product is , perhaps there’s a chance Apple can surprise and delight — just don’t expect to see an Apple Car anytime soon.Apple is also expected to release some software updates: iOS 15.4 that can let your Face ID-enabled iPhone  and also a macOS Monterey plus iPad OS 15.4 update that will finally enable the iPad to Mac traversing Universal Control feature.Check out all the latest Apple news as it breaks here on The Verge.Please confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hdOrD2V50xZHae3K5CDsbVG2uY=/0x0:1198x728/1200x800/filters:focal(504x269:694x459)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70585589/Screen_Shot_2022_03_02_at_12.03.10_PM.0.jpg,"Activision Blizzard suspends new sales ""of and in"" its games in Russia - Eurogamer.net

It looks beautiful, the cars feel incredible to drive, and it’s brimming with content, including hundreds of cars and loads of tracks to race them on.But GT7’s ace in the hole, as it was with PS5 exclusives Returnal and Demon’s Souls, is the haptic feedback and adaptive trigger functionality offered by the . GT7’s arguably the best use of the controller’s vibrations, too, with you able to feel every bump in the road, every gear change, even the sweeps of the windscreen wipers.But Gran Turismo 7 showcases the capabilities of the DualSense controller even further. Tucked away in the controller options menu is the choice to use motion controls in place of the analog stick, emulating the feeling of turning a steering wheel. It might sound like a gimmick, and I thought it would be, too, but upon trying out the DualSense’s motion controls for myself, I was shocked at just how well they actually work.What struck me immediately was how responsive the DualSense’s motion controls are. They remind me of the Wii Motion Plus peripheral Nintendo released for its Wii over a decade ago. Motion Plus almost completely eliminated lag from controller to screen, and considerably improved the accuracy of the motion controls.The DualSense Wireless Controller is remarkably accurate when playing GT7. With the motion controls option enabled and holding the controller head-on in front of you like a steering wheel, you can tilt the controller ever so slightly in either direction to perform fine adjustments to your car’s positioning on the track, or to navigate past easier corners.Rotating the controller to 90 degrees or beyond will let you cruise through tighter corners as well, and the motion controls blissfully have no issues with advanced circuit sections like slaloms, chicanes or hairpins.The DualSense’s motion controls are incredibly fun to play with when you’re racing on one of GT7’s off-road tracks, too. Oddly, I found it easier to drift this way than with the analog sticks, so much so that I’m tempted to tackle at least some of the brutally hard off-road challenges at the Licence Center with motion controls turned on.Gran Turismo 7 supports a wide range of racing wheel setups, but they can be very expensive, and so aren’t an option for everyone, especially if you’ve only recently bought a PS5 and a copy of GT7.GT7’s motion controls offer an experience close to that of a racing wheel. They may not be quite as accurate or tactile as a racing wheel, but they’re a solid alternative that’s both fun to use and free. I’m glad developer Polyphony Digital took the time to implement the control option into GT7. I’ve genuinely not had this much fun with motion controls since the inclusion of the Wii Wheel peripheral all the way back in 2008 with Mario Kart Wii, and if that’s not a shining heap of praise then I don’t know what is.Rhys is a Staff Writer for TechRadar, and while relatively fresh to the role, he's been writing in a professional capacity for years.

An independent Scotland would be better off staying out of the NATO military alliance, the Scottish Greens have said.The party - which will hold its spring conference on Friday - has no plans to change its defence policy despite . It puts the Greens at odds with the SNP as the Nationalists dropped their long-held opposition to NATO in 2012.Both parties remain opposed to nuclear weapons and are committed to removing them from Faslane if a majority of Scots vote for independence in the future.A senior defence figure today warned that relocating the UK's nuclear deterrent represented a threat to European security.The Russian invasion of Ukraine has already forced several European counties to reexamine their military spending and approaches to defence. The Greens have previously argued that an independent Scotland should immediately sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons which would make the Trident submarines at Faslane illegal and force their removal. A spokesman for the Greens said: ""Our position on NATO is longstanding and well understood.""As a democratic party any change in that position would be down to members, but as the world changes we would always look for ways to ensure peace and cooperation.""One only has to look at the important role the EU has played this week in terms of sanctions and practical support for Ukraine to see an example of a close working relationship between neighbours, not all of whom are members of the NATO alliance.”It comes as a retired defence chief warned that SNP and Green plans to remove nuclear submarines from the Clyde could imperil European security.Rear Admiral John Gower, a former submarine commander, warned that pulling out Trident subs would leave the West seriously exposed.""To leave Faslane and Coulport in short order after a referendum, and that is the SNP's position, would represent a very significant threat to the UK deterrent,"" he told the Sunday Times.""A precipitate departure from Faslane would represent a clear and present risk to that deterrent.""Seeing the departure of nuclear weapons from an independent Scotland might be seen as an easy gimme, a cosy feel-good risk-free by-product of independence for many Scottish voters. """"However, they need to be made aware, on a factual basis, of the repercussions for Scotland, the rest of the UK, the wider Nato alliance.""He added: ""Should the First Minister succeed in triggering a second independence referendum, the Scottish people should be in no doubt about the potential effect on the UK deterrent and thus in the worst cases the consequences to the security of the Nato alliance and broader European security.""Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron said: ""It is staggering that the appalling situation in Ukraine has failed to open the eyes of the Scottish Greens on how vital it is that we stand together as part of NATO.""The SNP have brought extremists into the heart of the Scottish Government who would rather we were less safe and secure than at present with the UK as a key part of the defensive alliance of NATO.""",https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article24895473.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/4_Defence-Secretary-visit-to-Faslane.jpg,"Protest in Bournemouth square against Russian invasion of Ukraine - Bournemouth Echo

  Dozens of people carried signs calling for the end of the conflict in Ukraine and for a closure of the airspace.

  Children carried Ukrainian flags and chants were made to “save Ukrainian children”.



  Oleksandr Bezprozvanny, Ukrainian national, held a sign aloft reading: “Get your bloody hands off Ukraine”.

  He said: “We are here to support our people in the struggle and the fight. We need a little more effort to stop this aggression against my peaceful, beautiful Ukraine.

  “I think they need to consider to make a no flight zone. I understand that could provoke consequences but I cannot watch this, these civilian people suffering.



  “My first impulse was to run and search flights, then I started considering other options.

  “This kind of thing helps a lot but it is very difficult. My father is in Ukraine.

  “It’s amazing to see these people come together. It’s heart-warming. I can’t describe it, it’s the true side of humans.”



  Chants could also be heard to stop Putin, leave Ukraine alone and to stop war.
