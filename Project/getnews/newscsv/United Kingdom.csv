"Wimbledon semi-finals: Berrettini v Hurkacz and Djokovic v Shapovalov – live! - The Guardian
Berrettini* 2-3 Hurkacz (*denotes next server)At 15-15 we are treated to the best rally of the match, the Italian eventually winning it thanks to a fine power-angle forehand into the left corner that Hurkacz can only hit long. But Berrettini then dumps a regulation forehand into the net for 30-30. He immediately hits back with a deep, wide first serve that extinguishes Hurkacz’s hope of winning a first break point ... then Berrettini nets another disappointing effort to make it deuce. The Pole saves one game point, then attacks the net and volleys crosscourt, in sublime fashion, to win advantage and his first break point of the match.Berrettini* 2-3 Hurkacz (*denotes next server)Now a love hold for the Pole, and we are still with serve in the first set. Berrettini hit one lovely backhand slice in that game, but immediately followed it up with a horribly skewed forehand. Still, the Italian has been far closer to breaking serve than his opponent, even if winning points against either player’s serve is generally proving tough.Berrettini 2-2 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server)Another love hold for the Italian, whose service game is looking very slick indeed. We are with serve after four games, with the Polish player having fought back to save himself from 0-40 down in the third game.Berrettini* 1-2 Hurkacz (*denotes next server)Berrettini has his opponent on the ropes at 0-40, but Hurkacz roars back to deuce, rounding off the third point of his recovery with two confident smashes. A couple more solid serves, and the Polish player has avoided falling a break down. That was a hugely impressive fightback from the 24-year-old, and he edges back ahead with Berrettini to serve again now.Berrettini 1-1 *Hurkacz (*denotes next server)Berrettini does indeed hold comfortably, to love, including one slice of luck with a big forehand that crashes into the net - but down on to Hurkacz’s side of the court. All square.Berrettini* 0-1 Hurkacz (*denotes next server)Hurkacz thunders a couple of big early serves down the middle and holds very easily, in about 90 seconds flat, to get the biggest match of his life up and running. He looks impressively relaxed, as he did against Federer two days ago. Berrettini will hope to hold his own service game in similarly efficient style.This is your two-minute call.John McEnroe says he gives Berrettini the edge in this match. “He’s been building up to this for a couple of years,” says the American pundit.And of Hurkacz: “What impressed me, particularly in that second-set tie-breaker, is that Hurkacz stood up mentally ... Federer kind of went away. ‘Hubi’, as he likes to be called, sensed that and he thrashed him.”The players are out on court, they’ve tossed up, and we are moments away from the first men’s semi-final of the day.Speaking to the BBC, Berrettini says the first time he played Hurkacz was as a 17-year-old, in a match in Poland. Berrettini is 25 now, the Polish player is 24.Berrettini has defeated Guido Pella, Botic Van De Zandschulp, Aljaz Bedene, Ilya Ivashka and Felix Auger-Aliassime to get to this stage.Hurkacz beat Medvedev before he beat Federer, in five sets, so he’s definitely had the tougher path to this stage.Both men are in their first Wimbledon semi-final.What else do we know about Hubert Hurkacz, the second Polish man to reach the semi-final of a grand slam tournament?Well, he adheres to a strict vegan diet, for one thing. He has also told the ATP Tour website that strawberries are his favourite fruit, so he’s in the right place in SW19.His dream dinner party guests?“It would be nice to have dinner with Roger [Federer], Robert Lewandowski, a Polish footballer, and I’m struggling for a third person…!”Can anyone stop Ashleigh Barty? Karolina Pliskova will be hoping to do so ...You may remember Hubert Hurkacz from such viral videos as the press conference with no journalists and no questions, back in April:After his demolition of Federer, I very much doubt a press conference sans questions is a luxury that the Polish player will enjoy again. Can anyone stop Novak Djokovic? Here is Simon Cambers:Hubert Hurkacz’s quarter-final victory on Wednesday felt more like a state funeral than a sporting event: Centre Court was plunged into a state of collective shock as Roger Federer, the king of SW19, was dispatched in three sets by the 24-year-old Pole, even suffering the indignity of a 6-0 reverse in the final set. We live in hope that .The world No 18 produced a largely flawless display to reach this semi-final: serving at 130mph, often matching Federer in longer rallies while throwing in the odd exquisitely-judged drop-shot for good measure. If he can produce a similar level this afternoon then the seventh-seeded Italian Matteo Berrettini, who dropped a single set in his quarter-final victory against Canada’s Felix Auger Aliassime, will be in for a tough day at the office.Following Hurkacz’s showdown with Berrettini, the No 1 seed, five-times champion and heavy tournament favourite Novak Djokovic will stride on to court. He was not genuinely tested by Márton Fucsovics in his  but it is safe to think that Denis Shapovalov, the 10th seed and world No 12, will provide a much sterner test. Shapovalov recovered from a set down to emerge from a five-set thriller against the Russian Karen Khachanov two days ago and he will be feeling suitably battle-hardened.Ashleigh Barty and Karolina Pliskova are already busy preparing for their women’s singles final tomorrow, and in a few hours’ time, there will be only two players left standing in the men’s draw.

This is the first time that fans have been allowed in to watch a British golf event since the pandemic took root 15 months ago. Only 4,000 have been permitted entry, which makes this incident yet more concerning. The intruder was able simply to stroll up unchallenged to the marquee grouping - also featuring world No 3 Justin Thomas - before nonchalantly reaching in between Rahm and McIlroy as they chatted, first taking the headcover off a wood and then settling upon an iron. McIlroy usually has at least one security guard with him, but it was unclear where the detail was on this occasion. It occurred on the 10th tee here at the North Berwick course, from where the group began. Rahm, the favourite for next week’s Open Championship where 32,000 per day will be admitted, was seemingly unaffected, going through his first nine holes in six-under to reach 11-under and into a three-shot lead over England’s Ian Poulter, who had played seven holes.

"UK economic growth slowed to 0.8% in May – business live - The Guardian
 there could be more disruption this summer if British holidaymakers head abroad for holidays.The head of the port of Dover has told Reuters that an increase in traffic will cause pressure, due to the extra paperwork at the border for freight at the border -- highlighting the need for more investment at the site.Here’s the story: A pre-Brexit trade rush led to 20-mile queues, but Doug Bannister, CEO of the Port of Dover, told Reuters the site had so far managed the switch to customs checks well, after Britain left the EU trade bloc at the end of 2020.“That’s because we haven’t seen the demand for tourists coming from our facilities, as we would normally expect to see,” he said on a bright sunny day as a ferry departed for Calais.“There will be longer transaction times and more processing,” Bannister said, if there was a rapid return of passenger cars to Dover, which was used by some 2.4 million trucks, 2 million tourist cars and 74,000 coaches in 2019.UK goods exports to the European Union rose in May, while imports from the EU remain much lower than before the Brexit deal came in.That’s according to the latest trade data, released by the Office for National Statistics, after a processing error caused a delay from 7am.It shows that total exports of goods, excluding precious metals, increased by £1.3bn (4.9%) in May, driven by a £1.0bn (8.0%) increase in exports to EU countries.Imports dipped by around £500m, due to a £700m drop in goods arriving from non-EU countries, which offset a slight increase of £100m from the EU.But despite that, the UK imported more from non-EU countries than the EU for the fifth consecutive month, although the gap is narrowing. Revisions to previous data show the UK exported more to the EU in February and March than previously reported, and imported less than first thought in January and February.Thomas Sampson, associate professor at the London School of Economics, says UK imports from the EU have ‘collapsed’ this year, compared to levels in 2019 (before the pandemic, and the end of the Brexit transition).Sampson has helpfully crunched the data, to show that UK-EU goods trade is lower than before the Brexit deal came in, but with imports into the UK taking a bigger hit than exports the other way.But there is a proviso... the EU’s statistics body, Eurostat, shows a much bigger fall in UK exports to the EU.(, but issue hasn’t yet been fully explained) Britain’s economic recovery stumbled in May when growth slowed to 0.8% after a contraction in building work and a slump in car production.It was the fourth consecutive month of GDP growth, and followed 2% growth in April, but the slowdown in May was sharper than expected after City economists had forecast a 1.5% increase.The  (ONS) said the manufacturing industry was hit by a shortage of computer chips that forced car companies to cut back production.As a result, transport equipment manufacturing fell by 16.5%, its largest fall since April 2020 and the worst period of the coronavirus pandemic.Shortages of timber and steel brought many building projects to a standstill and led to the construction sector shrinking for a second consecutive month by 0.8%.Over the three months to May, GDP grew by 3.6%, mainly because of strong retail sales over the period as non-essential shops, bars and restaurants opened their doors....Here’s the full story:China’s central bank has cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, in an attempt to spur lending and underpin its economy as growth slows.The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) says it will cut the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks by 50 basis points, effective on July 15.The move will release around 1 trillion yuan (£110bn) in long-term liquidity to help prop up an economic recovery that is starting to lose momentum. It will allow banks to lend more to customers, and hold less in reserve.This is the first RRR cut since April 2020, when the PBoC eased monetary policy to spur growth after the first wave of Covid-19. It had more recently been tightening policy, before today’s RRR cut.China’s State Council had signalled on Wednesday that an RRR cut was coming, to support the real economy and help businesses cope with the rise in commodities.Earlier today, China’s inflation came in lower than expected. Consumer prices rose by 1.1% per year in June, down from 1.3% in May, while annual factory gate inflation slowed to +8.8% from +9% (ie, how much producers charge for their goods).Bloomberg says: The timing and magnitude of the PBoC’s move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests growing concerns about the economy’s outlook, economists said.“The PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the China economy,” said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Financial Group Inc.“Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China’s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming second-quarter GDP figures in the coming week.”Carlos Casanova, Asia Economist at Union Bancaire Privée, tweets:European stock markets are rebounding this morning, after Thursday’s selloff.The UK’s FTSE 100 has gained 50 points, or 0.7%, back to 7080 points -- recovering around half of yesterday’s fall when falling bond yields and rising Covid-19 worries rattled markets.The Europe-wide Stoxx 600 is up around 1%, having lost 1.7% yesterday (its worst fall in two months).After a week of mayhem across global markets, calmer tones are finally prevailing, says Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM:The source of all the stress was the bond market, where yields started to break down. Such a move usually signals worries about weaker economic growth, which would ultimately translate into slower rate increases by central banks. When the bond market says something might be wrong, other asset classes pay attention. Stock markets came under fire yesterday and commodity currencies got hammered, while safe havens like the yen and Swiss franc shined bright. It was a classic risk-off move, with concerns around the rampaging Delta variant being blamed as the catalyst.However, that may be only half the story. The other part may be more technical in nature. Positioning in thebondmarket was stretched-short before this debacle, which means everyone was betting on higher yields by shorting the actualbonds. Fears around the Delta variant might have sparked the initial move, but it was likely amplified by a ferocious short squeeze in Treasuries. What does it all mean? In a nutshell, this pandemonium could fade soon as the short squeeze runs its course. We are already seeing signs of that today, with Treasury yields rebounding and Wall Street stabilizing.Philip Morris International, the tobacco company and maker of Marlboro cigarettes, has struck a £1bn deal to buy Vectura, the British pharmaceutical company developing a pioneering inhaled treatment for Covid-19.The £1.04bn offer by Philip Morris International, which is investing billions to move away from its core tobacco business, trumps the  in May. Vectura’s board had recommended that shareholders accept Carlyle’s offer but withdrew support for that bid after receiving the higher offer from PMI.“We recognise the material increase in the price offered to shareholders under the acquisition when compared with the Carlyle offer and have accordingly recommended the acquisition to shareholders,” said Bruno Angelici, Vectura’s chairman.“The acquisition will provide our people with the opportunity to form the backbone of an autonomous inhaled therapeutic business unit of PMI, helping develop products to improve patients’ lives and address unmet medical needs.”We had been expecting to get the latest UK trade data at 7am.....But unusually, it’s been delayed by a processing issue.Instead, we’ll get the headline figures at noon today, with the full report expected next week.The ONS explains:We have uncovered an error in the UK trade data prior to the planned release on 9 July 2021 at 7am. The error has occurred as we opened up the 2020 year to take on board corrections to HMRC data for non-EU trade which has caused a processing issue for the EU data.We will be able to correct our headline figures by 9 July 2021 at 12pm.The release will consist of a streamlined bulletin and dataset release covering headline figures only. We expect to be able to publish full, corrected data next week.Ending the furlough scheme and the  at the end of September could both hurt the UK’s recovery, warns Sam Miley economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.He writes:Overall, the economic recovery is set to continue in the near term. Indeed, much of the recovery is set to be concentrated in the coming months, with Cebr forecasts pointing to quarterly growth of 4.2% in Q3. This will largely be facilitated by the proposed easing of remaining restriction measures from July 19th and, notably, will take output above its pre-pandemic level. Beyond that, there are emerging signs of growth levelling off, with faster economic indicators pointing to slower growth in card spending and consumer footfall.There are other potential hurdles on the horizon that could slow the recovery. The most concrete of these is the termination of the furlough scheme, which has now entered its tapering phase before its complete cut-off at the end of September. Insofar as the scheme will heighten the risk of unemployment, consumers could rein in their spending and become more cautious amidst uncertainty and greater job insecurity.This could be further exacerbated by the proposed withdrawal of the Universal Credit uplift, which would adversely impact the livelihoods of the worst-off households, while also reducing aggregate consumption levels.The work and pensions minister, Thérèse Coffey, confirmed this week that the £20 rise in universal credit -  - will be removed at the end of September.That’s despite widespread public and cross-party opposition, with six former work and pensions secretaries urging the Treasury to keep the uplift, which costs £6bn per year.The easing of lockdown restrictions on hospitality, leisure and entertainment companies provided pretty much all the 0.8% growth in May.The accommodation & food sector (which grew by 37%) contributed around 0.7 percentage points of growth, as .Arts, entertainment and recreation (which grew by 7.3% in May) added another 0.1 percentage points to the rise in overall GDP, as visits to cinemas, museums, children’s play areas, theatres, concert halls, conference centres and sports stadia resumed.Rory Macqueen, principal economist at NIESR, warns that further reopening could potentially backfire:Like April, May’s GDP growth was faster than usual but almost entirely driven by the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, with the hospitality sector accounting for 0.7 percentage points of May’s 0.8 per cent growth. Underlying growth is moderate outside the sectors being unlocked, with supply constraints contributing to the continuing recent stagnation in manufacturing. It remains to be seen whether the lifting of further restrictions in July contributes to a continuation of strong growth in the third quarter or – if cases of Covid-19 continue to rise – increased caution among consumers and even another national lockdown.” highlights the “residual uncertainty in the pace of recovery”, says Alastair George, chief investment strategist at Edison Group: The weakness, relative to consensus forecasts, was broadly spread. However in manufacturing, rather than any demand shortfall. The outlook for the remainder of the year is all about “delta” and whether vaccinations can keep COVID-19 hospitalisations at acceptable levels during the autumn. Early UK data which indicates, according to our estimates, an 80% reduction in hospitalisation versus the second wave is clearly encouraging, but this is a preliminary assessment and there remains the risk of another yet more transmissible variant.” is especially disappointing at a time when some more timely indicators suggest that the economic recovery lost a bit more verve in June, says Paul Dales of Capital Economics.Of course, the pace of the recovery was always going to slow as the economy climbed back towards its pre-crisis level. But we hadn’t expected it to slow so much so soon.This could be a sign that the recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the delay to the final easing in COVID-19 restrictions from 21st June to 19th July are hampering the recovery.  the UK economy is more likely to return to its February 2020 pre-pandemic peak in October, rather than in August as previously forecast.But still, the recovery so far has been “faster than most imagined possible six or 12 months ago”, Dales points out, and the economy might yet emerge from the pandemic without much scarring.Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC, points out that May’s cold, rainy weather will have hurt the building sector (construction output fell by 0.8% during the fourth wettest May since 1862).“The data for May show that the recovery is continuing at pace, with the economy now showing four consecutive months of growth. Growth patterns were largely driven by people’s behaviour changing as they came out of lockdown - supermarket sales fell as more people ate out, consumers bought more on the high street and less online, more people travelled, so demand for petrol rose by 6.2%.The energy sector also received a boost because of colder weather experienced in May, but that is a mixed blessing and there were also significant weather related construction delays. He also points to some ‘concerning’ signs in this morning’s GDP report:“There are some concerning patterns though - output fell in several manufacturing sectors, microchip shortages disrupted car production, and while consumers spent more time on the high street, overall retail sales were down. Construction numbers fell and so too did components of the financial services sector.These trends suggest continued consumer caution and that businesses, despite having adapted amazingly well to lockdown conditions in the first quarter, may struggle to fully return capacity to pre-COVID levels.”UK manufacturing of ‘motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers’ fell by almost 27% in May -- a very steep decline in output.The fall in motor vehicle manufacturing was largely because of the ongoing microchip shortage, the ONS says.In late April, Jaguar Land Rover temporarily suspended production at two factories, Castle Bromwich in the West Midlands and Halewood on Merseyside, because it couldn’t obtain enough semiconductors.Mini also paused production at its factory in Cowley, Oxford for a few days around the start of May.Manufacturers around the world have been scrambling to buy semiconductors for months. Supply was hit by pandemic restrictions, while demand surged as people bought more electronics kit during the lockdown.This tumble in car production pulled output in the wider transport equipment sector down by 16.5% in May (as flagged before). Pharmaceuticals had a strong month:",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2007/09/28/phillip_inman_140x140.jpg?width=140&height=140&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=06b5730ce7f40d4b8bc25d6bd56b2dc3,"FTSE and sterling rise as travel stocks rebound - live updates - Telegraph.co.uk
Airlines Easjet, Ryanair and British Airways launched legal action against the British government's travel restrictions today, challenging ministers to be more transparent over how they judge the coronavirus risk rating assigned to destination countries.The litigation, led by Manchester Airports Group, with backing from Ryanair, easyJet, British Airways-owner IAG and TUI UK, is going ahead despite plans announced by the government yesterday to allow more travel.""British consumers need to understand how decisions are made so they can confidently plan their travel, which is why we are asking the government to provide the data and advice that is underpinning its decision making,"" the chief executives of the five companies involved said in a statement.The companies say it is still not clear how the government makes decisions about rating destinations under its traffic light system where low risk is green, medium risk is amber and high risk is red.Their case against the transport minister Grant Shapps was heard at London's High Court today.The Department for Transport spokesperson said its traffic light system cautiously managed the risk of new variants. Downing Street today rejected a new figure for the Brexit ""divorce bill"" from the European Union of £40.77bn. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""We don't recognise that figure. ""It's an estimate produced by the EU for its own internal accounting purposes. For example, it doesn't reflect all the money owed back to the UK, which reduces the amount we pay.""Our estimate remains in the central range of between £35-39 billion and we will publish full details in Parliament shortly.""Britain and the EU agreed a divorce deal under which Britain continues to pay into the bloc's budget to match commitments made during its membership.Here's the daily round-up from The Telegraph's Money team: Sterling has inched higher against a weakening dollar today but the currency is still on track for a second consecutive weekly decline as global sentiment grows wary about a surge of Delta Covid variant cases.After dropping in early trading, sterling edged 0.23pc higher to $1.3816 after yesterday's broader shakeout in FX markets that saw riskier currencies like the pound fall and safe havens gain.""Global growth sentiment is becoming less bullish as fears grow about the spread of the current Delta COVID variant and this is weighing on higher Beta currencies such as the pound,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital in London.Versus the euro, sterling rose 0.1pc at 85.82 pence, after having its worst day in two months on Thursday. Traders are keeping watch on a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Venice taking place today, where global tax reform is at the top of the agenda. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also called for better international coordination on carbon-cutting policies to avoid trade frictions, days before the European Union is due to unveil a controversial carbon border tax.The EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) would impose levies on the carbon content of imported goods in an effort to discourage ""carbon leakage"", the transfer of production to countries with less onerous emission restrictions.""It's important that any carbon border adjustment system focus on the degree to which a country's climate policies reduce emissions, and hence carbon content, rather than focus only on explicit carbon pricing,"" Yellen said. ""Recognizing the different paths countries are taking to address climate change could help avoid policy measures to address carbon leakage that inadvertently create new international risks and spillovers,"" she added.SoftBank has hired the former head of Israeli spy agency Mossad to run its technology investments in Israel, reports my colleague James Cook. The Japanese technology group confirmed on Friday that it had hired Yossi Cohen, who left Mossad in June, as its new head of Israeli technology deals.Mr Cohen ran the spy agency from 2016 and oversaw its operations targeting Iran, including the 2018 operation in which Mossad agents stole Iran’s secret nuclear archive in Tehran and smuggled it out of the country.The spy chief had reportedly been considered by former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a potential successor for the role when he left office.SoftBank has been one of the world’s most prolific technology investors thanks to its $100bn (£72bn) Vision Fund which backed businesses including ridesharing service Uber and office space rental company WeWork.Mr Cohen will invest in Israeli businesses through SoftBank’s second Vision Fund to which it has committed $30bn.Israel is considered a global hub of cybersecurity and defence businesses, making it fertile ground for investors seeking technology that could be sold to governments, law enforcement agencies and armies around the world.The investment business reportedly plans to invest at least $50m into each Israeli start-up it backs in deals that will value them at more than $250m.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the pandemic inspired shift to technology is making the economy more efficient.Bailey added the trend was particularly pronounced in the retail industry, where consumers shopped online instead of in physical stores during lockdown. Some of those changes will persist long beyond the pandemic, he added.“We do see already evidence of a shift to labour saving use of digital technology, which in itself raises measured productivity growth,” Bailey said on an OECD panel discussion today. “Probably the best example of that is retailing: we saw a 10 percentage-point increase in the share of online retailing last year.""The central banker said policy makers were working on understanding the link between automation, productivity and equilibrium interest rates.“It’s important that this change persists and raises the potential rate of growth because that will have a very important benefit in how we manage the very substantial increase in the debt burden, by both companies and governments from Covid,” Bailey said.Oil prices added to overnight gains, after a US government report showed rapidly declining inventories amid record-high fuel demand as the OPEC+ dispute drags on.  Brent crude was up 68 cents to $74.78 a barrel while US crude added 79 cents to $73.72 per barrel. Chicken prices may rise in the wake of a squeeze on supplies of carbon dioxide gas used in food production, reports Alan Tovey.He writes: Poultry farmers already facing higher costs because of a shortage of labour, post-Brexit customs complications and transport problems caused by a lack of lorry drivers now fear that gas shortages could tip them over the edge.

There are fears that the extra red tape caused by Brexit had means the port could be swamped when those levels return to normal, stemming the flow of goods.Dover's plea for £33m from a government fund to build extra customs facilities was rejected.Doug Bannister, the port's chief executive, has warned of logjams if it is not given more funding by ministers.“We handle £122bn worth of trade every year, and that is significant. Now if that starts to curtail, then that's going to be felt throughout all regions of the UK,"" he told Reuters. “If the money is not forthcoming then we've got some tricky decisions to make.”Extra funding would be used to add more capacity to check passports, and redevelop roads so trucks that do not have the correct paperwork have space to be sent elsewhere, avoiding jams at the port.Mr Bannister said it was right for the government to fund any required work because increased customs checks were part of the Brexit deal it had negotiated. He said an ""alternative funding mechanism from government"" was now needed.The Government has already funded extra customs processing centres away from Dover's port.Sterling has inched lower this morning, after data showed Britain's post-lockdown economic rebound slowed sharply in May despite the relaxation of restrictions. GDP grew by 0.8pc from April, the Office for National Statistics said, much weaker than the 1.5pc forecast made by economists.Sterling dropped to $1.3759 immediately after the data was released before lifting slightly. It is currently flat at $1.3780. ""Sterling has started the day on the back foot after May’s growth data came in below expectations,"" Francesco Pesole, FX Strategist at ING, told Reuters.""Some cracks in the so-far very positive recovery story in the UK may leave sterling a bit more vulnerable.""Versus the euro, sterling flattened at 85.94 pence, after having its worst day in two months on Thursday as the European Central Bank set a new inflation target, which gave the euro a broad boost.Steel making and mining company Evraz and outsourcer Bunzl are the stocks leading the FTSE 100 for gains today, up 4.15pc and 2.88pc respectively. Commercial landlords Landsec (up2.67pc) and British Land (2.32pc) are also rising, as the companies report levels of occupancy and rent payments as the economy reopens. Fashion brand Burberry Group is also up 2.87pc. At the other end of the index, B&M has dropped 1.93pc after the retailer reported Q1 sales fell by 4pc compared with the 33pc growth last year. Optimism is also rising in the real estate sector, with commercial property giant Land Securities - also known as Landsec - collecting 81pc of rent over the past three months as it hailed the return of more people to workplaces.The owner of Kent's Bluewater shopping centre said it has received £77m in rent payments for the quarter to June 24.However the group said there is £18m of rent outstanding, with £6m of this relating to customers where concessions have been agreed but documentation is pending.The company's chief executive officer said more people are returning to work and businesses are trading more freely as restrictions are lifted. ""We've been delighted with the numbers of our customers and partners who have engaged with us as a result, both to address their rent arrears and pay a sustainable rent as they are trading again,"" said Mark Allan. ""This shows that the Government's broad approach to rolling back the moratorium is having an effect, bringing landlords and tenants together to negotiate constructively.""However, it also highlights the need to accelerate the moratorium legislation so that we can meaningfully address those last remaining well-capitalised businesses who continue to refuse to engage with us.""Yesterday, developer Great Portland Estates said it had leased five times the amount of office and retail space in the three months to the end of June, compared to the previous quarter, as businesses commit to new operating space. Airline shares are feeling more optimistic today, as Britain planned to scrap quarantine for fully-vaccinated arrivals from other countries in the coming weeks. British Airways-owner IAG, easyJet and Ryanair rose between 1pc and 2.7pc on hopes that bookings to amber-list countries will rise as a result. EasyJet has already said bookings to amber-list destinations increased by 400pc since the announcement.A weaker pound is helping export-focused stocks, with Glencore, Rio Tinto, Unilever and GlaxoSmithKline boosting the FTSE 100 by 0.5pc. The pound is currently flat, down 0.04pc at $1.3781. Against the euro, it is 0.8592p. Jonathan Gillham, chief economist at PwC, comments:The data for May show that the recovery is continuing at pace, with the economy now showing four consecutive months of growth. Growth patterns were largely driven by people’s behaviour changing as they came out of lockdown - supermarket sales fell as more people ate out, consumers bought more on the high street and less online, more people travelled, so demand for petrol rose by 6.2pc.  The energy sector also received a boost because of colder weather experienced in May, but that is a mixed blessing and there were also significant weather related construction delays.   There are some concerning patterns though - output fell in several manufacturing sectors, microchip shortages disrupted car production, and while consumers spent more time on the high street, overall retail sales were down.  Construction numbers fell and so too did components of the financial services sector. These trends suggest continued consumer caution and that businesses, despite having adapted amazingly well to lockdown conditions in the first quarter, may struggle to fully return capacity to pre-COVID levels.GDP grew 0.8% in May but remains 3.1% below its pre-pandemic peak:▪️ services grew 0.9% (3.4% below peak)▪️ manufacturing fell 0.1% (3.0% below peak) ▪️ construction fell 0.8% (0.3% above peak)➡️ https://t.co/ncESKTKsQs The tobacco giant behind Marlboro cigarettes has launched a £1bn swoop for a London-listed lung drug specialist, gatecrashing a take-private deal by an American buyout firm, writes Oliver Gill. He reports: Philip Morris International has agreed a 150p-a-share deal to buy Chippenham-based Vectura Group as the cigarette titan vies to transform itself into a “wellness company”.  The FTSE 250 firm’s board is recommending a sale to the world’s biggest cigarette maker having struck a deal with private equity Carlyle.  Vectura focuses on inhaled medicines to treat lung conditions. It agreed a 136p-a-share deal with Carlyle in May.UK construction output fell 0.8pc May, the second monthly drop in a row and a sharp contrast with recent surveys suggesting strong growth.The chip shortage which has been affecting car makers led to the biggest fall in their output since April 2020, the Office for National Statistics said.The agency added that adverse weather conditions were also a contributing factor, as businesses lost working days.The decline in monthly growth follows exceptionally strong growth in February and March 2021.The FTSE 100 has edged 0.5pc or 38.88 points higher this morning after yesterday's sell-off and is currently trading at around 7,067.37. The FTSE 250 has made similar gains, lifting 0.4pc or 92.95 points up at 22,746.38.Willem Sels, chief investment officer of private banking and wealth management at HSBC, says:While the monthly GDP data series is volatile, and the UK GDP figure today slightly disappointed market expectations, the expansion continued in May. Economic growth was boosted by the gradual further lifting of restrictions, including indoor dining and sporting events.  As in the rest of the world, UK services are getting the biggest boost from the reopening, as consumers are eager to get back to normal. The savings ratio has been twice as high than the historical average for 12 months now, and we believe consumers will want to spend some of the savings accumulated during lockdowns. We expect the strong consumption growth to continue thanks to the further easing measures announced by the Prime Minister, and the likelihood that more UK households will opt for a ‘staycation’ and spend locally than in other years. In manufacturing, the debate about the impact of bottlenecks continues.  On the one hand, companies have to rebuild inventories, which are low, and this process should continue to boost demand. On the other hand, however, the shortage of some components needed in production chains may be leading to delays in production, hurting activity. We believe this uncertainty and the supply difficulties may remain with us for a few months still, but supply will ultimately match demand, and activity should remain solid.  The lower than expected GDP number should not really change the outlook for UK assets. The continued expansion should be a positive for equity markets, and we maintain a cyclical exposure to sectors such as industrials, financials and consumer cyclicals.The UK’s economic recovery slowed substantially in May, despite the continued reopening of the economy, reports Louis Ashworth. He writes: Gross domestic product increased just 0.8pc over the month, falling well short of the 1.7pc expected by economists. It marked a significant slowdown compared to April’s 2.3pc gain.  GDP is still 3.1pc below its pre-pandemic level in February 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics.Good morning.

 single vaccine dose is just 10 per cent effective against the Delta variant, new research has found.A study published in the journal Nature found that just a single dose of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine produced just 10 per cent protection against the variant first identified in India.Researchers conducted laboratory experiments on blood samples from people who had received their first dose but not the second.After a single dose, just 10 per cent of those samples had developed antibodies that neutralised the delta variant.However, after two doses 95 per cent of samples had developed neutralising antibodies against delta.Laboratory analysis also revealed that the mutation is four times more likely to overcome protective antibodies from the previous infection compared to the UK’s alpha variant.This means people who have previously caught Covid are now more likely to be reinfected.It comes as- the highest number of positive tests since January 23.This is slightly up from 33 deaths and 32,548 cases reported on July 7.Recent figures also show that Covid-19 case rates in all regions of England are at their highest level since the end of the second wave according to Public Health England.North-east England is recording the highest rate, with 613.4 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to July 4.Meanwhile, double-jabbed Britons have been given the green light to jet to holiday hotspots like Greece and Italy this summer without quarantine.From July 19, they will be able to return from countries on the ",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"COVID-19: The pinging of the NHS app may be a bell tolling for economic recovery - Sky News
There was a time, in the wake of the first wave of COVID-19, that politicians and economists yearned for a V-shaped recovery - an immediate bounce-back from the financial devastation of lockdowns.The second wave put paid to that, and as we tiptoe out of the most recent restrictions, the line drawn by GDP is starting to look more like an England supporter's ECG than a smooth path back to economic health.For the third consecutive month, GDP growth slowed in May. The increase of 0.8% was a fourth consecutive month of growth - almost inevitable given the restrictions on personal and professional life that applied at the start of 2021 - but only half of what had been forecast.What growth there was came from hospitality where restaurants and hotels, closed to indoor trade by government order until 17 May, saw a 37.1% increase in business, and the sector as a whole contributed almost all of the monthly growth.Without the easing of restrictions the economy would have been flatlining as supply bottlenecks and lingering consumer reticence constrained spending.The biggest drag on GDP came courtesy of the global microchip shortage that has slowed vehicle production lines and delayed production of consumer electronics. Transport manufacturing fell 16.5% in the month and, while recovery is under way, chip producers say shortages will linger until the end of the year.The economy remains 3.1% smaller than pre-crisis, and while continued easing of restrictions means economic activity is likely to increase, some have pushed back expectations of when it will return to the pre-COVID levels of February 2020 from August to October.A key factor will be consumer confidence as legal restrictions are dropped and our COVID security becomes dependent on the personal choices made by others.The impact of a new wave of cases on businesses' ability to function will also be crucial.

"New side effect added to two Covid jabs being rolled out in Scotland - Daily Record
 A new side effect has been added to two coronavirus vaccines that are currently being rolled out in Scotland. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has added heart inflammation to the list of side effects linked to the Pfizer and Moderna jabs.Experts say that the condition is “extremely rare” and is “typically mild” in those who have it. Anyone who suffers from “chest pain, shortness of breath or feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart” after receiving either jab should seek medical attention immediately, reports the Mirror. The MHRA said that the condition is more likely to affect young men after they have received their second dose of either jab. Medicines regulator officials investigated less than 100 cases in the UK of reported myocarditis, which causes inflammation of the heart and its lining. They concluded that the cases could be connected to vaccination.Last week Dr June Raine, MHRA Chief Executive, said: “We have carefully reviewed reports of suspected adverse reactions involving types of heart inflammation known as myocarditis and pericarditis...""We have concluded that the Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna may be linked with a small increase in the risk of these very rare conditions.""The cases tended to be mild and the vast majority recovered with simple treatment and rest.” The latest Public Health Scotland data shows that just over 1.6m people have been given at least a first dose of the Pfizer jab, while a further 135,000 for the Moderna vaccine.

Men are a third more likely to test positive for COVID-19 than women, according to scientists - and mass gatherings for Euro 2020 may be the reason why.Results from the latest REACT-1 study from Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori show one in 170 people in England had coronavirus between 24 June and 5 July.This is the first time scientists have distinguished a difference in infections among men and women.Experts suggest the fluctuations are likely to be caused by social mixing and men having ""more social activity than usual"".The interim findings found the number of people infected is doubling every six days on average - and London had the highest numbers of all English regions.The reason for the increased prevalence of COVID-19 could be down to a trio of issues, says Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London.The more transmissible Delta variant forms the majority of cases, social mixing plays a factor, and the younger population have not been fully vaccinated yet.Prof Riley says social mixing is affecting infection rates: ""There's lots of evidence that mixing inside is more likely to result in transmission than mixing outside.""If I had to speculate about the impact of the Euros, I would first think about the possible impact - much, much more broadly than around when we are around London - I would think about the increased probability that people are mixing inside more frequently than they otherwise would.""So my first thought wouldn't immediately be to the stadium and the immediate surrounds it would, it would be about the more general behaviour of the population, but we don't have results that speak to that directly in this study.""The findings follow revelations from Public Health Scotland that 2,000 COVID cases in Scotland have been linked to football fans watching Euro 2020 fixtures.""Different things could be affecting it. I think the degree to which men and women are socialising, is likely to be responsible, says Prof Riley.""And then because of the timing of that, then it could be that watching football is resulting in men having more social activity than usual.""Experts are warning some of the relaxation of restrictions will lead to high numbers of people mixing indoors. This would then lead to even more cases.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""As we unlock society and learn to live with COVID-19, we will inevitably see cases rise significantly over coming weeks.""But today's findings show that infection rates are three times lower for those who have had two vaccine doses.""It is more important than ever to get that life-saving second jab so we can continue to weaken the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths and build a wall of defence against the virus.""As we move from regulations to guidance and get back to our everyday lives, see our loved ones and return to work, it is vital people practice good sense and take personal responsibility for their own health and those around them.""",https://e3.365dm.com/21/07/768x432/skynews-england-denmark-euros_5440675.jpg?20210708020446

We’re certainly a long way out of the woods,’ Kate explained of her husband of 16 years.The 54-year-old added: ‘Being home has meant we’ve seen some things improve, definitely having the family around, having the children around has provided stimulation and the problem is you latch onto the positives – which is good, because you have to, but there’s absolutely no doubt that there’s huge challenges ahead.’Derek, 53, battled Covid-19 in intensive care for a year. He suffered from rare brain inflammation and the virus attacked his lungs, heart, kidneys, liver and pancreas, with doctors saying that Derek had the worst Covid infection of any surviving patient.In her book, The Power of Hope, Good Morning Britain star Kate explained that doctors said they couldn’t yet chart Derek’s recovery as they had ‘never seen anything like this before so can’t personally chart the recovery’.While  to Kate and their kids Darcey, 15, and Billy, 11, since returning home, Kate admitted that She told GMB: ‘He can’t really move, his communication is very minimal.

Our new study, published in Science, has come up with an answer.There are many examples of fractals in natures, such as ice crystals or branches on trees. In maths, the number of copies of an initial pattern goes on infinitely. Cauliflowers present a high level of such self-similarity, involving seven or more copies of the “same” bud. This is most conspicuous on the romanesco cauliflower (sometimes called romanesco broccoli, because of its colour), one of the first images that will appear if you search “plant fractals” online. What is striking about the romanesco is the very well defined, pyramidal buds which accumulate along endless spirals. Though less immediately obvious, a similar arrangement is present in other cauliflowers too. Spirals are found in many plants, it is the main pattern of plant organisation – a topic which has been studied for well over 2,000 years. But although cauliflowers share spirals with most other plants, their self-similarity is unique. Where does this special feature come from? And are the cauliflower spirals originating from the same mechanisms as those in other plants?Most available data was on Arabidopsis thaliana, also known as the “thale cress” flowering plant. Though this is a weed, it is of paramount importance in modern plant biology because its genetics have been extensively studied for many years, including many variants. And it turns out to be related to all cabbages, belonging to the family known as brassicaceae. Arabidopsis in fact has its , arising from a simple mutation involving only one pair of similar genes (see image on the left). So the genetics of this mutant plant are very similar to the genetics of cauliflower.If you spend some time observing the branches along the stem of, say, some weeds in your garden (which likely include close relatives of Arabidopsis), you will see how they are quite closely following each other, with the same angle between each successive pair. And if there are enough organs along this spiral, you will start seeing other spirals, going both clockwise and anticlockwise (see image on the right).If you manage to count the spirals, they will typically be numbers somewhere along the Fibonacci sequence, where the next number in the sequence is found by adding up the two numbers before it. This gives 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. On a typical cauliflower, expect to see five spirals going clockwise and eight anticlockwise, or vice-versa (see images below). But why? To understand how the geometry of plants develop over their lifetime, we need mathematics – but also microscopes. We know now that for every plant, the main spiral is already formed at microscopic scales. This happens very early in its development. At this stage, it comprises spots, in which very specific genes are expressed (turned on). The genes expressed in a spot determine whether this spot will grow into a branch, a leaf or a flower. But the genes are actually interacting with each other, in complex “gene networks” – leading to specific genes being expressed in specific domains and at specific times. This is beyond simple intuition, and mathematical biologists therefore rely on differential equations to write models of these gene networks to predict their behaviour. To work out how cauliflowers grow into their peculiar shape after the first few leaves have formed, we built a model which included two main components. These were a description of the spiral formation that we see in large cauliflowers, and a model of the underlying gene network that we see in Arabidopsis. We then tried to match the two so we could work out which genetics led to cauliflower structure. We found that four main genes are the crucial players: their initials are S, A, L and T, which we obviously joked about. The “A” is missing in Arabidopsis flowering plants that have mutated to become cauliflower-like, and is also a gene that drives spots to become flowers. What makes cauliflower so special is that these spots at the growing tip try to turn into flowers for some time (up to several hours), but keep failing at it for lack of “A”. Instead, they develop into stems, which turn into stems etc – multiplying almost infinitely without growing leafs, which gives rise to near-identical cauliflower buds. The time they spend trying is fundamental – getting this right in our model allowed us to reproduce cauliflowers and romanescos exactly on the computer. We confirmed this was right by altering the growth in a real-life Arabidopsis cauliflower mutant plant, effectively turning it into a shape much alike a miniature romanesco.It is amazing how complex nature is. The next time you have cauliflower for dinner, take a moment to admire it before you eat it.

Images of ten mysterious black objects circling around the International Space Station have been spotted by a star gazer. Now conspiracy theorists are wondering due to their pattern above the Southern Atlantic Ocean whether they could be UFO ’s which are following the Space Station. The footage from the NASA live stream show orb-like objects which have caused plenty of discussion among space enthusiasts on social media.UFO investigator “Mr MBB333” has shared a screenshot taken by the star gazer last Saturday.Posting it on YouTube he wrote: ""This is a screen grab from the International Space Station above the South Atlantic, at around 8.30am.""Ten unknown objects travelling with the space station above the planet Earth.""Many alien hunters have commented on the images and come up with different theories.One said: ""I just checked the ISS cameras and those little specks are still there.""Another wrote: ""What it looks like to me is there's a whole bunch of Black Knight probes."" The Black Knight satellites refer to the famed theory that there is a extraterrestrial spacecraft orbiting the Earth and that NASA  is engaged in a cover-up. But others think it could be some advanced technology used to collect data.""Air buoys, like sensors measuring data,"" one said and another put it: ""Or more frequently known as Starlink..."" Last month, truth-seeker Graham spotted several mysterious ""orbs"" flying past ISS cameras  during a live feed, reported the Daily Star. He captured them on a video and replayed them in slow motion, commenting: ""It looked to be perfectly spherical, similar to other UAPs that have been documented and seen throughout the skies of Earth.""It's very bright, which could be due to some kind of mechanical lighting or even a plasma.""The location of discovery was just above the ocean near the western coast of Chile, which he claimed was an area known for being a UFO hotspot.",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article24490165.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_ISS-mtystery-UFOS.jpg
"Windows 10 fans get the best news yet about upgrading to Windows 11 - Express
Windows 11 will launch later this year with Microsoft packing a swathe of new features into this blockbuster upgrade. Those making the switch will be treated to a swathe of features and upgrades including a new Start Menu, easy access to info-packed widgets and improved integration with Microsoft Teams.Windows 11 users will also find it easier to keep their PCs updated thanks to downloads that are 40 percent smaller and Microsoft is boasting that laptops could see improved battery life thanks to better efficiency.If all that sounds exciting then expect more news on when you can upgrade later in the year. However, if you are nervous about making the jump to Windows 11 then there's good news as it appears there will be an easy way to ditch it if you hate it.As spotted by the team at Windowslatest, it seems Microsoft and some PC manufacturers may offer the option to switch back to Windows 10 if you can't bear the new design and features packed inside Windows 11.READ MORE: A support document posted by Lenovo confirms that a rollback feature will be available when Windows 11 launches that will offer an easy way to get the old OS back on your laptop.""Once you have upgraded to Windows 11, you have 10 days to utilize the rollback function to move back to Windows 10 while keeping files and data that you brought along with you. After that 10-day period, you will need to back up your data and do a “clean install” to move back to Windows 10,"" Lenovo explains.It's unclear if this option will be available to all users or if it's something exclusively available to Lenovo owners but it could certainly offer some comfort for those who are worried about moving to Windows 11.News of this rollback function comes as Microsoft recently revealed that not everyone will be able to switch to Windows 11 in the first place.That's because this new software needs something called a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip to work.This piece of hardware makes things far more secure and it seems Microsoft wants Windows 11 to be safer for people to use.As Microsoft explains, ""Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations. The chip includes multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper resistant, and malicious software is unable to tamper with the security functions of the TPM.""It appears that any PC running a processor that's older than 8th Gen Intel Core and AMD Ryzen 2000 will not work. That means an expensive trip to the local gadget shop to buy a new computer.",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/59/590x/Windows-11-update-1460403.jpg?r=1625815243142,"Death Stranding Director's Cut costs an extra $10 to upgrade from PS4 to PS5 - Gamesradar
The  will be available as a next-gen upgrade for anyone who owns the original game on PS4, but not as .In a recent video Q&A, Jay Boor, head of publishing at developer Kojima Productions, explained how the upgrade system will work. A question posed on Twitter asked whether the developer was ""calling it a Director's Cut so they can sell it again at full price and not offer a free upgrade for people that bought the original cut on PS4,"" with user Apnomis saying that ""if there was a small upgrade fee [...] I might consider it, but not paying full price again.""Boor explained that this was almost exactly how the path will work, stating that ""if you purchased any Death Stranding digital version for PS4, you get the full Death Stranding Director's Cut Digital Deluxe edition for PS5 for only $10."" If you haven't purchased the game yet because you've been waiting for its next-gen cut, you'll be able to get both the standard version, and the Digital Deluxe version with its handful of add-ons, via the PlayStation Store. This isn't the first time that a next-gen version of a PS4 game has seen a slight increase in price. For example, if you want to upgrade Ghost of Tsushima on PS4 to the  on PS5, that'll set you back around $30. Given that Sucker Punch is billing its new cut as a full expansion rather than a collection of new content, that should explain why it'll cost less to upgrade Death Stranding.Elsewhere in the video, Boor explains the new graphical options available in the director's cut. There'll be two picture modes; a 4K 60fps performance mode, and 'Fidelity Mode', which also runs at 4K, but features HDR and ultrawide support. There's also a discussion about what exactly the term 'Director's Cut' means for Kojima and his development team.Death Stranding Director's Cut is currently due to launch on PS5 on September 24, but is available to pre-order right now via the PlayStation Store.For more of the best of next-gen, here's a list of upcoming PS5 games.I'm GamesRadar's deputy news editor, working with Ben T across our gaming news articles.

Sony has removed a PlayStation 5 advert which showed the console placed upside down.Fans spotted the incorrectly-positioned PS5 in the video yesterday, posted to Twitter. Overnight, the advert was quietly deleted from the internet.The heartwarming ad began with a dad telling his son a bedtime story. Thinking of his current God of War playthrough, the dad starts telling his son a tale of how a father and son went for a walk in the mountains. The cherubic child quickly falls asleep. Back downstairs, the dad settles down to play God of War - but on a PS5 which is upside down in his TV unit.Sony has not commented on the removal, the upside-down console, or the ad's accuracy of getting a small child to go to bed.For reference, if you choose to align your PS5 horizontally, the disc drive should be at the base of the console. But it is confusing. Last December, Kotaku spotted PlayStation Studios boss Herman Hulst also had his PS5 upside down in a video posted to Twitter of his cat climbing on his TV.

"Sarah Everard: Police officer Wayne Couzens pleads guilty to murder of 33-year-old - Sky News
Metropolitan Police officer Wayne Couzens has pleaded guilty to the murder of Sarah Everard - in a case which caused widespread shock and outrage that led to protests at the rate of violence against women.Couzens kidnapped Ms Everard in a hire car as she walked home alone from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, in March.The 48-year-old firearms-trained parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, who had clocked off from a 12-hour shift that morning, went on to rape and strangle the 33-year-old.Last month, Couzens, from Deal in Kent, accepted responsibility for killing Ms Everard and pleaded guilty to her kidnap and rape.Today, with five members of her family and Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick present in court, he pleaded guilty to her murder when he appeared at the Old Bailey via a video link from Belmarsh high security jail.The police chief said she had personally apologised to Ms Everard's family, telling them how ""very sorry"" she is for their loss, adding the force was ""sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes - they are dreadful, and everyone in policing feels betrayed"". by the police watchdog over matters relating to the case.Prosecutor Tom Little QC told the court Couzens and Ms Everard ""were total strangers to each other"". He ""had not previously met her, he did not know her and had no direct or indirect contact with her"", he said.Sky's crime correspondent Martin Brunt said it is still unknown what drove Couzens to commit the killing, who he said kept is head bowed and ""appeared to be shaking, perhaps even sobbing at one point"" as he whispered his plea during the 20-minute hearing.Jim Sturman QC, defending Couzens, said: ""His pleas today represents a truly guilty plea and remorse for what he did and, as he put it to us this morning, he will bear the burden for the rest of his life - his words: 'as I deserve'.""Sentencing was adjourned by the judge, Lord Justice Fulford, for a two-day hearing from 29 September, after discussing legal precedents for whole life sentences.Following his arrest, the killer concocted an elaborate story, claiming he had run into financial difficulties after getting into trouble with a gang of Eastern Europeans who threatened him and his family and demanded he deliver ""another girl"" after underpaying a prostitute a few weeks before.He told officers that after the abduction, he had handed Ms Everard over, still alive and uninjured, to three Eastern European men in a van in a layby in Kent.The defendant went on to make no comment in formal interview and was charged on 12 March.Ms Everard's disappearance sparked a major investigation, with her body being found in a woodland in Ashford, Kent, a week after she vanished.She was last seen leaving a friend's house on Leathwaite Road in Clapham, southwest London, at around 9pm on 3 March.As she set off on foot for the two-and-a-half mile journey home to Brixton, south London, from the Clapham Junction area, she chatted to her boyfriend Josh Lowth on her mobile phone for about 15 minutes.That call ended at 9.28pm, and footage from a doorbell camera showed her on her own.Just three minutes later, a bus camera appeared to capture the moment she was approached by Couzens in Balham, south London.Two figures could be seen standing by the hire car, which was parked on the pavement with its hazard lights flashing.After snatching Ms Everard, Couzens drove out of London, arriving in the area of Tilmanstone, near Deal, at 1am.Couzens had booked the hire of a Vauxhall Astra - using his personal details and bank card - on the afternoon of the abduction, and bought a roll of self-adhesive film days before the murder.Investigators tracked the route of the car using CCTV and ANPR cameras and identified the driver as a serving officer through the car hire firm.In the days that followed, Couzens reported that he was suffering from stress and did not want to carry a firearm any more, according to a case summary.On 8 March, the day he was due on duty, he reported in sick.The next day, police arrested Couzens at 7.50pm - 39 minutes after he wiped the data from his mobile phone.Follow the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, SpreakerHowever, detectives were able to link the device to the kidnapping, and the area where Ms Everard was found, which was near a patch of woodland Couzens and his wife had purchased in Ashford in 2019.Her remains had been dumped in a stream inside a large green builders' bag - which Couzens was caught on CCTV buying at a B&Q in Dover two days after Ms Everard was last seen alive.In June, police revealed that Ms Everard's cause of death was ""compression of the neck"".The finding was made in a post-mortem examination into the death of the marketing manager.An inquest into her death was opened and adjourned pending the outcome of criminal proceedings.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/03/768x432/skynews-sarah-everard-missing_5300811.jpg?20210311110856,"Rishi Sunak says young people ‘over the moon’ to get back to workplaces - The Independent
Rishi Sunak has urged workers to return to the office when coronavirus restrictions lift.But unions warned the government was risking the safety of workers returning after the expected lifting of the order to work from home on 19 July.The chancellor said he was looking forward to the return and insisted there was a benefit to workers from being with their colleagues, particularly for the young.He said that Zoom and Teams were ""not great"" for workers starting out and that in-person interactions were ""really valuable"".""I think for young people, especially, that ability to be in your office, be in your workplace and learn from others more directly, is something that's really important and I look forward to us slowly getting back to that,"" he told the Daily Telegraph.He said that apprentices at a car mechanic training centre he met in Wolverhampton were ""super-excited to be back in their workplace"".""They were over the moon, because they've spent six months trying to learn on Zoom and Teams and everything else, and it hasn't been great,"" he said.""They were saying actually being in, and most importantly, getting the support from their mentors, has been really valuable to them.""The longstanding work-from-home order has fuelled concerns about the economic impact of people staying at home, with town centre businesses such as cafes suffering from the lack of trade.With the final step of the government's lifting of lockdown restirictions in sight, firms will have freedom to ask workers back, and set their own office safety measures.Mr Sunak said it was not for ministers to tell firms what they should or should not do, adding: ""Ultimately I trust people and businesses to make decisions for themselves.""The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said ministers were refusing to consult with employers and unions on plans which will affect millions of workers.The TUC wrote to ministers on Thursday to raise concerns over worker safety, saying that the government had undermined public confidence by announcing the end of face mask obligations without consultation.Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said: ""We all want working life to get back to business as usual.""But as restrictions are lifted and increasing numbers return to their workplaces, it is crucial that we get workplace safety right, and give workers and members of the public confidence.""She said the TUC has ""real fears that clear, detailed guidance for employers will be replaced by vague exhortations to employers to do the right thing, resulting in confusion"".Ms O'Grady warned that without detailed plans the country could be ""hobbled by rising infections and enforced self-isolation"" keeping workers out of action.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
