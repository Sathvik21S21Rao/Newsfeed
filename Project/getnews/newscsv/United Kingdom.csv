"Manchester United 3 Newcastle 1 LIVE: Ronaldo scores twice - Evening Standard
anchester United vs Newcastle LIVE!Cristiano Ronaldo is back.The Portuguese legend rolled back the clock with two goals on his second Manchester United debut in a 4-1 win against Newcastle.The 36-year-old returned to Old Trafford 12 years after leaving for Real Madrid and proved he is still a match-winner of the highest quality.He will face tougher tests than Steve Bruce’s side – but this felt like a statement from the forward of what the Premier League can expect from his second-coming.He is not the flying winger he once was. He is now the consummate poached and he needed only two sights at goal to make Newcastle pay.Old Trafford erupted as he fired United ahead in first half stoppage time when Mason Greewood’s strike was fumbled by Freddie Woodman.It was not a classic – but it was the type of goal United do not score often enough, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer often bemoaning the lack of desire from Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford to gamble in the six-yard box.Newcastle momentarily stunned the home crowd when Javier Manquillo levelled on 56 mintues – but it was Ronaldo who restored United’s lead.Luke Shaw’s run and lay off gave Ronaldo the chance to strike from just inside the box and he powered an effort through the legs of Woodman after 62 minutes.Bruno Fernandes scored the goal of the game with a 25-yarder with 10 minutes to and substitute Jesse Lingard rounded off the scoring in stoppage time.Follow Manchester United vs Newcastle with Standard Sport’s LIVE blog and James Robson at Old Trafford...What a return for Ronaldo. That was a statement performance and it wasn’t as if he was at his best. Premier League defenders beware!Now Lingard is on the score sheet. Good work from Martial and Pogba in the build up. Substitutions:Martial and Van de Beek for Greenwood and Fernandes. Hendrick for Willock.Newcastle substitution with Lewis coming on for Clark. 3-1Fernandes makes sure he is not forgotten. An absolutely brilliant strike from about 25 yards into the top corner. United are looking more comfortable now. Newcastle are being forced to defend deep and have shown little sign of bursting forward. Can Ronaldo crown a perfect day with a hat-trick?Newcastle are not lying down here. Joelinton forces a snap save from De Gea.Substitution: Lingard comes on for Sancho.2-1Guess who? Newcastle were on level terms for less than six minutes. A break from United and Shaw plays in Ronaldo to blast through the legs of Woodman.

Max Verstappen will start the Italian GP on pole despite finishing behind Valtteri Bottas in Saturday's F1 Sprint, as Lewis Hamilton's horror getaway cost him three places and vital title momentum at Monza.Bottas officially won F1's second-ever Sprint after 18 laps of drama, but has an engine penalty for Sunday's race and so will drop to the back of the grid - handing championship leader Verstappen an unexpected pole.Hamilton was the favourite to be in that position come the chequered flag, but the Mercedes driver was left ruing a poor start that dropped him from second place to fifth, as Verstappen and the McLarens came charging past.Pierre Gasly also got ahead of Hamilton before heavily crashing out with front-wing damage, causing an early Safety Car.After that, Hamilton relentlessly put pressure on Lando Norris, with DRS, but just could not get past his young British compatriot.Verstappen finished a couple of seconds behind Bottas, but takes two points for finishing second to increase his championship lead to five points, while Daniel Ricciardo also collected a point after bringing his McLaren home in third.He will start Sunday's race - live on Sky Sports F1 at 2pm - on the front row behind Verstappen, while Norris and Hamilton will form the second row.Charles Leclerc overcame sickness to finish sixth for Ferrari ahead of team-mate Carlos Sainz, who had his own pre-Sprint worries after heavily crashing his car in Saturday's earlier practice.They were followed by Antonio Giovinazzi in the Alfa Romeo, who expertly held off Sergio Perez in the other Red Bull.Perez had earlier tussled fiercely with Lance Stroll, having to cede position after an illegal overtake at the first chicane.Italian GP: F1 Sprint result1) Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes*2) Max Verstappen, Red Bull3) Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren4) Lando Norris, McLaren5) Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes6) Charles Leclerc, Ferrari7) Carlos Sainz, Ferrari8) Antonio Giovinazzi, Alfa Romeo9) Sergio Perez, Red Bull10) Lance Stroll, Aston Martin*starting at the back of the grid due to engine changeIn a mini race that sets the grid for Sunday's all-important Grand Prix, drivers knew that not making mistakes would be vital. But that's exactly what Hamilton did come lights out, ruing another bad start in the Sprint.Just as Hamilton got away slowly from the front at the format's British GP debut - which Verstappen won - the seven-time champion didn't start cleanly at Monza, then seeing Verstappen and Ricciardo move alongside and past him on the left, before Norris came through on the right into Turn 1.In a normal race, perhaps that error wouldn't have been so costly, but with only 18 laps of the sprint it was always going to be hard for Hamilton to catch back up to title rival Verstappen, and in the end he couldn't even pass a McLaren.Norris parked his car in all the right places to, not for the first time this season, frustrate Hamilton, right up until the chequered flag.It leaves Hamilton in a position of weakness on a weekend where Mercedes were expected to dominate Red Bull, who they have been around half a second lap quicker than around the high-powered track.In race conditions, Red Bull cut that advantage.""We lost a lot of points,"" said Hamilton. ""Got to try and figure out how I can get by the McLarens tomorrow, and try to limit the damage.""He added: ""You saw the pace of the Red Bull. I don't know if he was quicker than Valtteri but they're so fast, and now he's on pole. So it should be an easy win for him.""Verstappen was certainly the big winner from Saturday, and will hope to extend his title lead back into double digits on Sunday.Gasly, meanwhile, has to go down as the big loser.The Frenchman, a shock winner at Monza last year, started sixth and moved ahead of Hamilton around the outside, but pivotally damaged his front wing after touching the back of Ricciardo's McLaren. Soon after, he went speeding off into the barriers.He will start at the back in Sunday's Italian GP. But as we have seen from Monza over the years - and indeed on Saturday - expect the unexpected.",https://e2.365dm.com/21/09/768x432/e632d84c76bc3b7a37317d6281c6c3650f75889c211a646146ee743d3589f23b_5508694.jpg,"Crystal Palace 3-0 Tottenham: 10-man Spurs dominated at Selhurst Park - Cartilage Free Captain
Trash. Tottenham Hotspur went to Crystal Palace, a team that many tipped to be relegated preseason, undefeated and top of the table. Then the match kicked off and Spurs laid an egg. Missing a number of key players, Spurs played terribly from the opening kick. Eric Dier picked up an early injury and had to be subbef off, Japhet Tanganga got sent off for two quick yellow cards, Ben Davies was flagged for a handball penalty that Wilfried Zaha converted, and new boy Edsonne Edouard scored two lovely goals as a second half sub as Palace cruised to a 3-0 home win at Selhurst Park.Pain.

NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW ITMikel Arteta sprung a surprise with his team selection ahead of Arsenal’s must-win Premier League match against Norwich with Aaron Ramsdale starting in goal in place of Bernd Leno.With the pressure firmly on him, Arteta opted to ring the changes with Leno’s omission the headline decision. The former Bayer Leverkusen star had conceded nine times already this term, including five in the hammering Arsenal took at the Etihad Stadium prior to the international break.Here’s how we line up for #ARSNOR ðRamsdale, meanwhile, kept a clean sheet on his competitive debut in last month’s 6-0 Carabao Cup win over West Brom and was given the nod over his more experienced teammate for the visit of a Norwich side who are also without a poitn so far.Explaining the decision, Arteta said: ‘Like the other seven changes we made, they are to try and win the match. We have two fantastic goalkeepers and today we have gone for Aaron.’Elsewhere, Takehiro Tomiyasu was selected to make his debut following his deadline day arrival from Bologna, while Ainsley Maitlaind-Niles earned a starting spot having come close to leaving his boyhood club during the latter stages of the transfer window.Thomas Partey, meanwhile, was only fit enough for a place on the bench, as was Emile Smith Rowe who has been suffering with illness this week.‘We need a reaction because we need results, we lost three games,’ added Arteta. ‘Certain things need to be changed. We changed dynamic, we changed personnel for different reasons so let’s go for it.‘I cannot ask for anything it is time for us, the team, to give to the fans. They have given us a lot through the years, they’ve been really patient.’

The exact transport and dining arrangements of the travel correspondent of The Independent are, naturally, a closely guarded secret. But it can now be revealed that Simon Calder travelled incognito from his North Devon hideaway by Megabus via Taunton and Weston-Super-Mare to Bristol for this week’s Ask Me Anything.Living the dream did not end there: he then installed himself in Pret a Manger in Queen’s Road to tackle your pressing questions for an hour. These are the greatest hits.Q: I am also in Bristol but hoping to be in Rhodes by tomorrow night. Do you think we’ll be safe from the “red list” on the traffic light review next week? And I’m 100 per cent correct as well that Greece don’t require a negative test to get in? Just a PLF?Mel GA: How lovely to be heading for Rhodes. There is zero chance of red listing for mainland Greece and its islands. Fully vaccinated? No need to do anything other than complete that passenger locator form by midnight Athens time, 10pm UK tonight. Q: My husband and I (both double vaccinated) are on a cruise in October from Barcelona to Trieste. All of the countries we call at are green or amber except Montenegro – just added to the red list.The port of call is Kotor. We have been before and know that it’s a tender port. So if we stay on the ship does this affect our status when we return to the UK? In other words, do we have to quarantine just because we have been in Montenegrin waters? I know things may change before we are due to go, but what would your advice be at the moment?Sue MillA: An intriguing and important question – thank you. Suppose you do stay on board. As you say, large cruise ships anchor in the deep bay and passengers are taken into town by tender.Now, you might imagine that if you simply stay on board, as you have not set foot on Montenegrin soil that would mean you have not visited a red list nation. Therefore, you might conclude you escape hotel quarantine on return to the UK. But the transit rules set out by the UK government for stops made in red list nations indicate otherwise.“Making a transit stop would not affect what you have to do on arrival in England if, during the stop: no new passengers, who are able to mix with you, get on; no-one on-board gets off and mixes with people outside; passengers get off but do not get back on.”Sadly I think that the second criterion means you are scuppered. Undoubtedly other nationalities of passengers – as well as some of the crew – will go ashore and mix with the friendly locals.But don’t at this stage feel obliged to book that 11-night stay in a quarantine hotel at the end of your trip, at a cost of £4,000.There are three things that could happen.1 Montenegro’s status might change, though evidence suggests once you are on the red list you tend to stay there for a good while.2 More likely, the whole 62-country red list will be reappraised and shrink to a few really risky locations (not including Montenegro.3 If neither of these things happen, then the cruise operator is likely to alter the itinerary if a significant number of passengers are British – which would be a great shame because Kotor is a spectacular, beautiful and fascinating port of call.Q: Same question you get every time, but what do you think Turkey’s chances are for a move to the amber list?Rachel HA: That’s tricky – case numbers have been rising recently, which is unfortunate timing. But as above, I expect the red list to start shrinking pretty soon – it is unsustainable and some of the countries on it are by any measure less risky than some members of the amber list. So Turkey could be a beneficiary of this shrinkage. Q: We are due to fly to the Maldives for our honeymoon on 19 September. What is the likelihood of Maldives moving from red to amber on this review? From what I’ve read the Maldives narrowly missed out on the last review. Also, I assume if it does change that this wouldn’t come into effect until the following Monday (20 September). Would we still have to follow red rules as we depart before the official change in status?A SmithA: The Maldives are my top choice for exiting the red list. While nothing can be taken for granted, I am 90 per cent confident the islands will be moved to the amber list. The fact that you will be there what are the remains on the red list is, perhaps surprisingly, irrelevant. All that counts is the status of the country at the moment you arrive in the UK. And that means the wheels touching the runway.Q: With all the talk of scrapping the traffic light system, what do you expect to happen with the red list? I’ve booked a flight to South Africa for January 2022, as I haven’t seen my mother who is in her early 90s for almost three years. The flight has been rebooked at least twice.Doc BeanA: So sorry you have been separated for so long. It is increasingly untenable for the government to maintain that arrivals from South Africa present a significant public health threat to the UK. So I will be amazed if South African arrivals are still required to go into hotel quarantine by next year. If I am wrong, then I suggest you launder your red list status somewhere lovely such as Spain, Portugal, Italy or Greece.Q: We are due to go to the Dominican Republic on 10 October for our wedding. What are the chances of it going ahead – and what’s the criteria for the DR being on the red list? I have been following all the details online: cases, deaths, vaccination rates, etc.It looks like the Dominican Republic should be on the green list by the details available to the public. Your comment?AurimasA: I share your frustration: the beautiful Dominican Republic, which looks increasingly alluring with every day of dismal weather here, looks to be one of the more unfortunate members of the club nobody wants to belong to – the UK red list.Q: How is Jamaica looking in the next review??Miss N DA: Infection rates have been increasing in Jamaica, and a move to red list status cannot be ruled out. However I hope the government is fully aware of the severe impact that such a change would have. Besides being a wonderful holiday destination, of course there are very strong family links with Jamaica. So my view – which is pure speculation – is that it will remain on the amber list.Q: I am double vaccinated and am due to travel to Switzerland in about ten days’ time. As I understand it, my Covid Pass to travel will suffice for me to enter the country. My issue is my NHS records are in my maiden name while my passport is in my married name.The UK government advice is to ask your GP to change your name registered with them so they match the passport. I have a complicated medical history and don’t want to risk elements of my medical records going astray in a name change and also, it is perfectly legal to use both names in whatever contexts I choose (I checked with a solicitor).I can carry my marriage certificate with me to prove I am the same person, but I have no way of knowing if this will work, and don’t want to risk it. I can’t be the only person encountering this issue. Can you offer any advice please?Name suppliedA: The accounts I have seen of people who are in this unfortunate position indicate that carrying proof of marriage – and that means the original marriage certificate – should be sufficient.You could also, for example, take an old passport in your maiden name to show that you are one and the same person.Q: I’m looking to book a weekend in Marrakesh for 17-20 September. The entry requirements on the UK government website say Morocco accepts double vaccinated travellers with no test but that Morocco haven’t yet confirmed it will accept the UK solutions to demonstrate vaccine status. So they advise travellers to follow guidance for alternative entry requirements – ie a pre-departure PCR test.I’m not keen to book with the hassle, risk and cost of a PCR test. Have you heard of what’s actually happening at the border?JuliaA: As far as I can see, the UK is on Morocco’s “A List” and all you need is “a vaccination pass or certificate of vaccination to enter Morocco.”The Health Ministry in Rabat says: “The vaccines authorised in Morocco are : AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Sputnik, Pfizer/BioNTech, Janssen, Covishield, Moderna, Sinovac.”I suggest you apply today for the NHS Covid Pass letter (link here) which, I believe, is available in French.Q: I have two teenage boys, ages 13 and 15, who due to their age are unable to get vaccinated. As more and more countries are asking travellers over the age of 12 to be double vaccinated is anything being done to overcome this problem?Frances1974A: Frances, I believe we are moving towards a situation where key tourism destinations will actually be bending over backwards to make their testing and vaccination requirements easier, not tougher. Therefore even if country A demands proof of vaccination, nations B and C will not.Q: I’m double vaccinated but unfortunately just received a positive Covid test. We’re due to fly to Spain in 14 days time. Can I still travel and if I can, how do I negotiate re-entry to the UK?Karen EA: I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. By the time you travel to Spain, you should be fully recovered, and then as you indicate the main issue is testing to fly back to the UK. Assuming you follow government advice for those who have recently recovered from Covid, and take a lateral flow test rather than a more sensitive (and possibly false-positive generating) PCR, you should be good to fly home. And then, if the mandatory post-arrival PCR is positive, you can demonstrate your recovered status for the satisfaction of NHS Test & Trace. Get well soon and have a great trip.Q: I would like to go to France for the weekend to visit my mum but I don’t really want to have to pay out for expensive PCR tests on our return. Do you think PCR tests for short trips like this will still be necessary by the end of the month or in October. As far as I’m concerned we will be driving straight to her house not even getting out the car until we arrive at her house and then staying in her house and then back home againKerry AA: The UK is in the absolutely bizarre position of having the highest Covid rates of any major European country, and at the same time the toughest arrival rules.This makes no sense, and is simply sapping demand for travel, outbound and inbound.I expect the government’s opposition to international travel to change quite quickly, not least because as soon as furlough ends the awful state of the travel industry will become evident. Ministers might at last show some interest in rescuing what is left of it.Q: We travel to Greece next week for seven days. It’s tempting to get the (expensive) Welsh Day 2 PCR test ordered before going as it’s easier and probably more secure than doing it from Greece. But with rumours of change to the test requirements for vaccinated people, would you advise us to delay booking the tests until two or three days before we return to the UK?“Fairly sanguine”A: Please don’t book that test! You can book it from the airport in Greece before you fly home. Which is when I would be doing all the pre-departure nonsense. Things can only get better.Q: Do you think a trip to the US will be allowed by December this year?STR 7A: I give you odds of 80:20 that it will be possible. At present Joe Biden has no particular enthusiasm for opening up to Continental Europe, let alone the UK, as he battles with soaring coronavirus rates in the US and anti-vaxxers.But by winter, when the travel industry in the US may be more vocal about the loss of European visitors, I expect the president to pay more attention and remove the bizarre presidential proclamation first imposed by Donald Trump.Please bear in mind that I am often over optimistic.Anyway, when the US finally accepts UK arrivals, I am optimistic that a reasonable regime will be in place for children. After all, families make up the vast majority of visitors to Florida.Q: We have a package holiday to Las Vegas due to depart 23 October. The online travel agents have told us this week, the trip will go ahead, but should US borders be closed in October, approximately 10 days prior the airline will offer a refund in the way of a voucher. The hotel money would be refunded to us in cash.Can we ask for a full cash refund for both parts of this trip?Nikki StaffsA: Under the Package Travel Regulations, if UK visitors are still banned from the US, then your trip cannot go ahead and you would ordinarily be entitled to a full cash refund within two weeks. However, it might prove a bit of a battle to secure your money back. So the short answer to your question is: yes, you can ask for a full cash refund – so long as it is legally impossible for you to make the trip. But if you know that you will be flying that way again soon, it might be just easier to accept the voucher.Q: A lot of questions are being asked about the US opening up to travellers from the UK but what would be the chances of the UK government adding the US to the red travel list, given the high case numbers there at present?Tom HA: Almost zero. Short of an eruption of a new and extremely dangerous variant – in which case almost all international travel will be off – I cannot envisage any circumstances in which the US would be added to the red list. The same, by the way goes for all our most popular European destinations, including France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece.In fact, I expect the red list to start shrinking pretty soon – it is unsustainable and some of the countries on it are by any measure less risky than some members of the amber list.Q: Due to fly to Slovakia later this month, and they currently require a PCR test “no older than 72 hours” to enter from the UK? Could you advise whether this is 72 hours before departure time of the outbound flight, or 72 hours before arrival time in Slovakia?Jonny OA: The Foreign Office says, slightly unhelpfully: “You must also be able to show a negative PCR test result no older than 72 hours, regardless of your vaccination status.” It is not entirely clear whether that is before arrival or departure from the UK.If it were feasible, I would urge you to organise a test at the airport before you depart – Heathrow has just got a facility with a three hour turnaround for PCR tests.I appreciate there are zero flights from Heathrow to Bratislava or anywhere else in Slovakia, unfortunately. So I fear you must assume it is 72 hours before arrival in Slovakia – and time your test accordingly.Q: We’re in Italy for a couple of weeks, we are driving. We want to go back through Switzerland, without stopping to get into France and then to the UK. We will not have been in the UK for over ten days, having been in France and Italy. My understanding is that as we are both fully vaccinated we don’t need to do anything else. Am I right?Stevie CA: I predict you will be able to be to drive straight through without a problem. But just in case, I suggest you pause at the Swiss border and, if you can see any officials there, just double check you are entitled to drive through (in the very unlikely event they say no, I’m afraid you will need to swerve west and cross from Italy into France).I am hearing occasional reports of people with British number plates transiting miscellaneous European countries being stopped and questioned about their travel history – make sure you keep evidence of your absence from the UK, perhaps including hotel or restaurant receipts.Q: Do you think that Germany will be moving back to the amber list in the next week’s review? Cases have risen since last review but the vaccination rate is quite high. Thanks!LBRA: No. Germany is managing things pretty well. Indeed, for a lot of last autumn it was the last major European nation standing. Q: We are planning a multi centred trip in December from Hungary to Krakow. We will have unvaccinated members of our group and we specifically chose this as it seems we can get from UK to Hungary to Poland and back to UK all with just tests, no jabs necessary. Am I right in thinking that we will be able to pull this off?!“Tudorfan”A: Sorry I can’t predict what the rules will be three months from now. But I hope and expect they will be relaxed. Q: Are we safe to book a trip to Crete?Sarah AnneA: The main risk I can see concerns the local transport in Crete – driving standards, unfortunately, are poor relative to the UK. Clearly, accidents in water are also a danger.But if your question is more of “Will Greece or its islands be added to the red list?” the answer is no. Have a great trip. Q: Myself and family are desperate for some Christmas sun and would love to go to Hurghada in Egypt. Do you think this will be possible, as we are itching to book? If not, where would be your best destination bet for us to go for some warm weather and a much-needed break? Jo CarrollA: I am absolutely with you in yearning for winter sun in Egypt – my absolute top choice between November and February. As you know it is on the red list.Although the official case numbers are low, so too are testing rates. And so I am afraid that you and I may not be able to get there for Christmas. Next best choice, as always, is the ever reliable archipelago of the Canary Islands.Q: We enjoy our “big” holiday at Christmas & New Year, Caribbean, SE Asia and such. Given the current situation, where would you predict this year is likely to be open and accessible to UK tourists?Lenny GA: As mentioned earlier, I am pretty sure that South Africa will be off the red list by the end of the year. Thailand, too. But my top choice is South America. Currently all arrivals from that wonderful continent to the UK must go into hotel quarantine. I think, though, there is a good chance that Chile and Peru will be off the red list very soon.Distant dreams: sunset at Barnstaple in North DevonWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Car owners will no longer have to take another test to tow a caravan as the Government scrambles to free up capacity to train new lorry drivers and deal with Britain’s supply chain crisis.In an attempt to provide an additional 50,000 test slots a year for HGV learner drivers, Grant Shapps has announced a series of measures designed to ease the burden on supermarkets and businesses in the run-up to Christmas.In a statement issued on Friday, the Transport Secretary said that waiving the requirement for car drivers to take another test to tow a trailer or caravan would free up examiners and allow another 30,000 HGV tests to be conducted per year.Other measures include removing the need for HGV drivers to take two tests, which were previously spaced three weeks apart and required to drive both a rigid and articulated lorry.The tests will also be made shorter by removing certain elements.The changes have been implemented amid mounting concern over , which is having a knock-on effect on supermarket, retail and restaurant deliveries and supply chains.As part of our roadmap to tackle the HGV driver shortage affecting countries across the world, today I've announced that we will add 50,000 more HGV driving tests a year, on top of the 50% increase in tests that @DVSAgovuk has already added🚚🚚🚚The estimated 90,000 vacancies have been blamed on a mixture of the pandemic, global supply chain issues and Brexit, with thousands of drivers said to have retired after being furloughed or having returned to Europe.Industry leaders have warned without urgent action there could be significant disruption during the key Christmas trading period, and have urged the Government to place lorry drivers on the immigration shortage occupation list.However, ministers have so far rejected their calls and argue that the issue must be dealt with domestically by hiring more British drivers and paying higher wages.In a written ministerial statement published on Friday night, Mr Shapps added: “The driver shortage is a widespread problem affecting countries across Europe and also the United States, caused by a range of factors, including an ageing workforce.“Today’s announcement will ramp up driver testing and numbers and help industry leaders build a resilient haulage sector which attracts drivers from across society.”It came as Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, warned that the current shortages in supermarkets were .“It’s going to get worse, and it’s not going to get better after getting worse any time soon,” Mr Wright told listeners at an event organised by the Institute for Government.“The result of the labour shortages is that the just-in-time system that has sustained supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants – so the food has arrived on shelf or in the kitchen, just when you need it – is no longer working.“And I don’t think it will work again, I think we will see we are now in for permanent shortages. Now these shortages don’t mean that you’re going to run out of food.”However, Downing Street insisted that the UK food supply chain was “highly resilient”.We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Visit our adblocking instructions

"Sixteen Covid variants sweeping UK as hospitalisations reach highest in seven months - The Mirror
 Some 16 variants of Covid are spreading across the UK and more than 1,000 people are in hospital battling the disease. Coronavirus cases are once again on the up, with data yesterday showing 37,622 people are currently infected with the virus. While 1,063 Covid patients were admitted to hospital on Monday September 6 - the highest figure since February 24 - hospitalisations are still far lower than when the virus peaked.The UK has also dished out a massive 48,370,340 first doses of the Covid vaccine, which protects against the bug's numerous variants.There are 16 different Covid variants spreading across the UK, according to the latest government data.The most common of these is the Delta variant, of which a total of 669,401 cases have been recorded in the UK so far.Here is a lowdown of each of the variants.The Alpha variant was first detected in the UK and was first sequenced here in September 2020.The UK has so far recorded 277,951 cases of it - 227,217 of which are in England.Scotland has seen 29,123 Alpha cases, while Wales and Northern Ireland have seen 12,466 and 9,145 respectively.The variant has so far spread to more than 50 countries. The N501Y mutation, seen in the Alpha variant, may help the virus spread more easily.This variant, first detected in South Africa, was first sequenced in the UK in December last year.There have been only 1,110 cases of it confirmed in the UK so far.Of these, 996 were found in England, 62 in Scotland, 43 in Wales and nine in Northern Ireland.Beta also shares the N501Y mutation, like the Alpha variant, meaning the virus could spread more easily.Beta has a key mutation, called E484K, which could help the virus sidestep some of the body's immune defences.More than 669,000 cases of this variant have been recorded in the UK so far, 556,542 of which have been found in England.Scotland has recorded 58,022, Northern Ireland has noted 33,552 and Wales has had 21,285 of the Delta variant.Delta has undergone some changes to its spike protein, the part of the virus that attaches to human cells.Analysis by Public Health England found two doses of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines was more than 90 per cent more effective against hospitalisations for Covid caused by the Delta variant.Just 46 cases of the VOC-21FEB-02 variant have been recorded in the UK - with 45 of these in England and just one in Northern Ireland.No cases of the variant have been recorded in Wales or Scotland so far.The variant was first detected in the UK in December 2020.Gamma was first detected in Japan in travellers from Brazil in January 2021. It was first noted in the UK in the following month.A total of 178 cases have been confirmed of the variant in the UK. Of these, 253 were found in England, 23 in Scotland and two in Wales.The Gamma variant also shares the mutation, N501Y which makes the virus better at infecting cells and spreading.It also has the E484K mutation that could help the virus sidestep some of the body's immune defences.First detected in India, the Kappa variant was later identified in the UK.And the UK has since recorded 517 cases of the variant with 471 in England.Scotland has had 27 cases, Wales 15 and there have been four cases in Northern Ireland.This variant was also first detected in India. It is responsible for 18 total cases in the UK, 15 of which were recorded in England and three in Wales.Little is known about this rare variant.This variant was first detected in the UK in December 2020.The UK has so far recorded 79 cases of it - all of which have been found in England.First detected in the UK in December last year, this variant has been logged 512 times across the UK with 460 of those cases in England.Scotland has logged 40 Eta cases, Wales 10 and Northern Ireland two.It has been found in 23 countries overall.This variant was first detected in England, with 314 cases confirmed in the country so far.Another 43 have been detected in Northern Ireland along with 11 in Scotland.This variant, first detected in Brazil, was first sequenced in the UK in November 2020.Some 60 Zeta cases have been detected in the UK, including 54 in England.This variant was first detected in the Philippines.There have been seven cases detected in England so far and three in Scotland.There have been 185 cases of this variant logged in the UK so far.All of these cases were in England apart from one found in Wales.First detected in Thailand (in travellers from Egypt), this variant is rare.A total of 158 cases of this variant have been detected in the UK.Of these, 147 were in England, four in Scotland, four in Wales and three in Northern Ireland.

Keep up to date with the latest stories with our twice daily WalesOnline newsletterThe mandatory face mask rule may return in England this autumn if there is a spike in Covid cases.People over 18 may be told to wear them inside supermarkets, shops, and on public transport as a legal requirement. It comes amid reports that Boris Johnson is “adamant” that another lockdown will not be reimposed, due to the vaccination programme, The Mirror reports.The Prime Minister is expected to announce his plan for avoiding a full lockdown including the introduction of Covid jab boosters next weekHe is also expected to reveal that the biggest ever flu jab campaign will be rolled out at the same time.Among contingency measures that could be deployed to avoid pubs and schools having to shut again are also reportedly offices closing again and a return of some social distancing rules An official spokesman for Mr Johnson told the Guardian that the nation should be ready for the NHS to face a “difficult time” this winter. Mask mandates are likely be one of the first measures reinstated should infection rates rise alarmingly.Downing Street are said to see the move as preferable to reimposing social distancing rules because it has less of a direct impact on the economy, reports The Daily Telegraph.Covid restriction laws are also being extended until next spring, meaning that fines could return for people who ignore orders to wear masks in certain settings.It comes as UK Covid cases are rising in 92% of regions - with Scotland seeing the highest infection rates in the country.Of the 377 local areas in the UK, 345 (92%) have seen a week-on-week rise in rates, 31 (8%) have seen a fall and one is unchanged.",https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/jevsd96N/poster.jpg,"Ignoring expert advice on child vaccines will dissolve public trust in the state, ministers warned - Telegraph.co.uk
Ministers faced a backbench rebellion on Friday night over children’s vaccines after 26 Tory MPs warned that overruling expert advice risks “dissolving the bond of trust” between the public and the Government.Their intervention comes as Prof Chris Whitty, England’s Chief Medical Officer, prepares to advise ministers on whether there is a wider .In the letter, MPs pointed out that a “large part” of the UK’s inoculation programme success stems from the work of  the JCVI which had “successfully determined the priorities for the vaccination rollout since January”.They added: “As a result of their leadership, the UK has one of the  in the world, and so far over 90 per cent of the adult population has felt enough trust in its analysis to confidently have at least one vaccine dose.“Every step of the way, from the first jab administered back in December, to three quarters of us now being fully vaccinated, the JCVI has brought the country along with it.”Signatories of the letter include Esther McVey, the former secretary of state, Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench MPs, and William Wragg, the chairman of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee.MPs said they are concerned that any attempt by the Government to “overrule” the advice now risks “dissolving the bond of trust that has grown between state and public”.Last week, the JCVI delivered its long-awaited verdict, saying the “margin of benefit” of jabbing 12- to 15-year-olds was “considered too small” and citing the low risk to healthy children from the virus.However, Mr Javid said he wanted Prof Whitty and the chief medical officers from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to “consider the vaccination of 12- to 15-year-olds from a broader perspective”.He said he would then “consider the advice from the chief medical officers, building on the advice from the JCVI, before making a decision shortly”.MPs told Mr Javid that the Government’s “willingness to challenge this decision, and to chart its own course independent of the country’s scientific advisers, is a moment for serious concern”.They said that if the JCVI was overruled, and vaccinations were rolled out to children, then a cost-benefit analysis must be published immediately so that Parliament can debate the issue properly.Molly Kingsley, the co-founder of the parent campaign group UsForThem, which organised the letter, said that many parents were “horrified” about the prospect of the vaccine rollout to children going ahead.  She added: “It doesn’t sit well with the JCVI’s latest position and there are escalating and serious concerns about risks to young people both short and long term which must be addressed.”  Earlier this week, a major study found that teenage boys were six times more likely to suffer from  than be hospitalised from Covid-19.Children who face the highest risk of a “cardiac adverse event” are boys aged between 12 and 15 following two doses of a vaccine, according to new research from the University of California. Adult patients are also being added to waiting lists and booked in for booster jabs ahead of the anticipated rollout, it has emerged.Dr Mike Smith, a GP in Stevenage, said they have prepared a database of highly vulnerable patients and have made some “anticipatory plans” to start their boosters, including planning how many are housebound and how many could travel to the surgery.“We are going to do it quite quickly because what we don’t want to do is bring vulnerable people up to the surgery whilst other people are turning up with their coughs and colds,” he said.But he added the information remained “conflicting” around who may be eligible for a booster, meaning they are currently only able to plan the “bare minimum”.Dr Krishna Kasaraneni, a GP in Sheffield, said although there is still no clarity on who will be eligible, his practice has their patient lists ready to go from the first and second doses, should a rollout be announced. Other patients across the country have shared on social media that they’ve been added to a “waiting list” for their third dose.One man in his 60s, who did not want to be named, said his GP surgery in County Durham had added him to a list but said they were “in the dark” about who would actually be eligible. Joseph Gellman told The Telegraph his 83-year-old grandfather, who lives in Harrow, has already been booked in for his booster for the end of the month.“He was told to come for his flu jab mid-September and then his Covid booster a week later,” he said. The JCVI is expected to announce their recommendations for booster jabs imminently. We rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Visit our adblocking instructions

Lawyers for Prince Andrew have raised questions about how legal papers were served in the sexual assault case being brought by Virginia Giuffre.Ms Giuffre’s legal team claimed it had served papers on him relating to a case in America by handing them to a Metropolitan Police officer on duty in Windsor last month.Documents filed in a New York court said this was “consistent with the provisions for service upon an individual defendant, under Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, as required by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England and Wales”.However, Blackfords, who said they represented the Duke of York “in certain UK matters”, queried that assertion in a letter on 6 September. They wrote: “We reiterate that our client reserves all his rights, including to contest the jurisdiction of the US courts (including on the basis of potentially defective service).”They added Ms Guiffre’s claim may not be viable, citing a 2009 release in a separate court case in Florida. Ms Giuffre’s lawyers called this an “erroneous suggestion”.Ms Giuffre alleges the Queen's second son sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager. She claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender and Andrew's former friend, to have sex with the duke when she was 17 and a minor under US law. Andrew has strenuously denied all the allegations.In documents filed to the US district court for the southern district of New York on Friday, Ms Giuffre’s lawyers said there was a first attempt to serve the papers on the duke on 26 August, when an agent went to Windsor Great Park.They state that a Metropolitan Police officer at the Royal Lodge, who was the head of security, told the agent officers were not able to accept service of any court process, or let anyone trying to serve legal papers into the property.The agent returned the next day and was told the court process could be left with the police officer at the main gate “and that this matter would then be forwarded on to the legal team”.The document said the complaint, the summons and other papers were packaged together “in a plastic sleeve and then in an A4 envelope, addressed to the said defendant, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, at the address” and then given to the police officer.It said that within 21 days of the summons the plaintiff must be served an answer to the complaint, and “if you fail to respond, judgment by default will be entered against you for the relief demanded in the complaint”.On Friday ABC News reported apparent further details of Blackfords’ 6 September letter. Gary Bloxsome, a partner at the firm, wrote that a number of attempted services of the papers by Ms Giuffre’s team had been “irregular” and “in at least one case accompanied by a media representative”, the broadcaster reported. He called this “regrettable”.Mr Bloxsome reportedly wrote that in his view, requests for cooperation from British courts must be made by an American judicial or diplomatic officer, not the plaintiff’s lawyer.A US judge will ultimately determine whether the papers were properly delivered. Judge Lewis Kaplan will hold the first pre-trial conference in the case via teleconference on Monday.Andrew has stepped back from public duties amid the fallout from his relationship with Epstein. His withdrawal came after a 2019 Newsnight interview which saw him attempt to draw a line under his relationship with Epstein, who died in prison two years ago, but which only resulted in more negative headlines.Reports said Andrew was currently staying at Balmoral, the Queen’s Scotland retreat.A representative of the duke declined to comment when contacted by The Independent.Buckingham Palace declined to comment.Additional reporting by agenciesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Commentators: Michael Cole, Corey Graves
Ring Announcer: Greg Hamilton-A video aired on the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 including footage of the first WWE event after it and some other sporting events afterward, plus the building of the new tower in place of the Twin Towers.-They went to a wide shot of the arena full of fans chanting “USA! USA!” Then they went to Michael Cole and Pat McAfee at ringside. Cole noted it’s their first time in MSG for Smackdown in two years. McAfee took a verbal shot at the terrorists.-Roman Reigns’s theme played and he walked out with Paul Heyman and the Usos. They milked the entrance as much as ever. Reigns asked Heyman if they run “sports entertainment in New York City.” Heyman said Reigns does. He asked everyone to acknowledge him. Fans chanted “Roman! Roman!” Brock Lesnar’s music then played and the crowd popped. Cole said it’s his first appearance on Smackdown in nearly two years, but noted he returned to WWE in Las Vegas, Nev. at Summerslam. McAfee said if the aliens came to Earth and wanted to fight a human, “this is the one we’d send.” Reigns stepped up to his face. The Usos then stepped in and got in his face. Lesnar smiled at them.Heyman said, “Brock, Brock, I fail to understand. I have one simple question for you. Of all the championships we could go after, why the Universal Title. Think of all the success we could have.” Lesnar put his hand over the mic. Lesnar said, “I’ve got a question for you, Paul. Why didn’t you tell Roman I was going to be at Summerslam.” Reigns and the Usos shot him a look. They liberally muted the “You f—ed up” chant that the New York fans were chanting. Heyman said he didn’t know and pleaded with Reigns to believe him. Reigns yanked the Universal Title belt from Heyman and left the ring. The Usos followed. Lesnar laughed as Heyman stood nervously with Lesnar in the ring.Heyman said “Ladies and gentleman, my name is Paul Heyman. And for 20 years, I was the advocate for the reigning, defending, undisputed WWE Heavyweight Champion of the world, Brock Lesnar!” Lesnar said that was great, just like old times. His expression then changed. He said, “Before Roman Reigns fires you, accept my challenge, please.” Heyman asked what challenge. Lesnar grabbed Heyman by the lapels and said, “My shot against Roman Reigns for the Universal Title.” He told Heyman he had five seconds. He lifted Heyman for an F5, but Reigns interceded with a Superman Punch. Lesnar fell backward with Heyman still in his arms. Reigns went for a Superman Punch on Lesnar, but Lesnar caught him. The Usos superkicked Lesnar, but Lesnar fired back by clotheslining both of them. He gave each of them back suplexes and then tore off his flannel shirt and stared down at Reigns. [c]-WWE touted 13.5 million followers on TikTok, beating the major league sports organizations.-Backstage, Kayla Braxton approached Reigns, the Usos, and Heyman. Reigns and the Usos went into the locker room and seemed shaken up. She asked if Reigns will accept the challenge. Heyman, with a shaky voice, said Brock accused him of knowing he was coming to Summerslam and betraying his Tribal Chief. He said the Tribal Chief has to get his cousins ready to defend their tag titles “and here you are, hanging out in a hallways like a Jersey Girl ambush interviewing us asking all the wrong questions at the wrong time.” He said the Tribal Chief will answer Lesnar’s challenge when he feels it’s appropriate. He then went into the locker room.-Sami Zayn was standing in the ring and interrupted the Shinsuke Nakamura and Rick Boogs ring entrance. He declared, “I love New York!” He said he has arranged for a very special guest to be in their corner, someone who knows what it takes to win at MSG. He asked the crowd to give a big NYC welcome to Mr. Trey Young from the Atlanta Hawks. McAfee said he took the soul out of the arena the last time he played the Knicks. Sami was in a Knicks jersey and he welcomed Trey.(1) SAMI ZAYN & APOLLO CREWS (w/Commander Azeez) & OTIS (w/Chad Gable) & DOLPH ZIGGLER & ROBERT ROODE vs. SHINSUKE NAKAMURA & RICK BOOGS & REY MYSTERIO & DOMINIK MYSTERIO & BIG EOtis tossed Nakamura to the floor. Nakamura kicked Gable when Gable got near him. He backed away from Azeez. Otis then knocked him to the floor where Gable trash-talked him. Otis stood on Nakamura’s chest and then splashed him in the corner. They cut to an early break. [c]Sami tripped Rey as he ran the ropes. Trey choked Rey over the top rope. The ref kicked him out of ringside. The fans roared. Trey complained for a while. Ziggler collapsed like he was just given the worst news ever. Rey recovered and tagged in Dominik. They landed a double 619. Big E then finished off Sami for the clean win.WINNERS: Big E & Boogs & Nakamura & Rey & Dominik in 10:00.-Kayla interviewed Big E mid-ring and congratulated him on the win. He said they had one heck of a team just like this year’s New York Knicks. She asked about his MITB briefcase. She asked what is next for him. He said this might not be the last time they see him out there tonight because whether it’s Bobby Lashley or Roman Reigns, “if you have what I need, I’m coming for your neck.” He said might show up next Monday on Raw, too. The crowd quickly deflated. He said they will feel his power.-They hyped Seth Rollins vs. Edge.-Bianca Belair made her ring entrance next. [c]-Adam Pearce and Sonya Deville were in the ring as Belair entered and danced to her music. Pearce asked her to make it official and sign the contract. McAfee said, “Contract signings are the best!” Belair said it’s great to be at MSG. Fans loudly chanted, “EST! EST!” She said the last time she was in the ring with Becky Lynch at Summerslam, she wasn’t expecting a title match. (She was scheduled to face Sasha Banks, so that’s not the best wording.) She said what she used to respect most about Becky is she would never run from a fight, “but my have things changed.” She said Becky knows if they really had a match, she’d lose. She said she respects Becky less than she used to. She signed the contact. McAfee said, “This is going really smooth!”Becky Lynch then came out in sunglasses and a big red coat. It was over-the-top obnoxious and alone enough to turn fans strongly against her. She’s having so much fun being a heel. She sat down, leaned back, and said, “The original WrestleMania main eventer has arrived.” She said she saw how star-struck Belair was at Summerslam, “delighted to  share the ring with Big Time Becks.” She told her there’s no shame in sitting out there with the regular people. She told Pearce and Deville she said she’d give Belair the match when she was ready. She said it might have been tonight at MSG and she’d have beat her in 20 seconds. She asked what if she doesn’t sign it. Belair said, “Sign the damn contract!” She said everyone wants her to sign it. “Sign it! Sign it! Sign it!” Belair said. The fans then chanted that. McAfee said 14,425 strong were chanting it.(Keller’s Analysis: Really good segment. They didn’t drag it out, either. Becky is having a blast as a heel. Belair is benefiting. It’s one of those angles that seemed bad at first, but has played out well. Both Becky and Belair have been great.)-They aired a video package on Edge vs. Seth Rollins. Edge then made his ring entrance. [c]-Heyman was on his phone when Tegan Nox and Shotzi drove by in their tank and asked Heyman if he needed a ride. Kayla then appeared and Heyman yelled, “What?” He said all she does is nag nag nag. He said Reign is going to witness his cousins beat The Street Profits, and then live in MSG he will answer the challenge of Brock Lesnar. “Whether that is a yes or a not, don’t you just love a good cliffhanger.” He turned around and there was Big E holding up the briefcase. He made some high-pitched noises and began quivering.(2) SETH ROLLINS vs. EDGEAs Seth came out, Cole talked about Edge’s neck surgery and talked about the potential ramifications if Seth is successful in landing the Stomp on Edge. The bell rang and fans chanted “Edge! Edge!” They worked at a slower pace to start. Seth landed a dive through the ropes at 3:00. Then they cut to a break. [c]-They announced Bobby Lashley vs. Randy Orton for the WWE Title this Monday night on Raw.Back to the match, Seth was in control at ringside. Seth worked over Edge for a few minutes. Edge made a comeback, blocking a Pedigree and then giving Seth a Pedigree of his own. He scored a two count. The crowd was popping for the spots and the kickout. They chanted “You still got it!” McAfee said the man who made it famous is an absolute stud. Edge leaped off the top rope onto Seth at ringside. They cut to another break. [c]After the break, Edge landed a full nelson slam for a near fall. Edge gingerly climbed to the top rope, but Seth popped up. McAfee asked if he’s a spider monkey. Edge dropped Seth face-first off the ropes. He then applied a standing leglock. Seth twisted out and sent Edge into the bottom turnbuckle. Edge rolled through into an STF a minute later. Seth reached for the bottom rope. Edge blocked his hand and then slammed his head into the mat. Seth did grab the ropes then, forcing the release. Rollins came back a couple minutes later with a bucklebomb. Edge caught Seth with a spear as he charged at him and got a believable very near fall that popped the crowd big. They went to a wide shot of the arena. McAfee said MSG is having an out of body experience with a match surpassing expectations.Seth hit Edge with a low-blow that the ref didn’t see, and then a superkick, dropping Edge to his knees. Cole said Edge was defenseless. Seth hit another superkick. Edge sat up again. McAfee said he’s too tough for his own good. “Get the hell out of the way!” he said. Seth landed a third superkick. He asked if Edge had anything left. He then delivered a stomp. He covered Edge and got the three count. The ref frantically called for medics to help Edge out. Cole said this is something they’ve been fearing ever since Edge came back. They cut to a break as they showed Seth looking on admiring his work. [c]-They showed Edge being loaded into an ambulance. Then they replayed key moves at the end of the Edge-Seth match. They went backstage where the ambulance drove off. Pearce and Deville gave Seth an angry look. Seth seemed a little shaken up. Sarah Schreiber asked him for a comment. He stammered and said he doesn’t know how he feels or how he’s supposed to feel. He said maybe he doesn’t feel anything at all.-They cut backstage to Reigns, the Usos, and Heyman. Heyman stood in the background, but seemed to have regained his confidence. Reigns gave the Usos a nice pep talk – for him, at least. He said they run the Garden and they run WWE, so don’t lose. The Usos said they’ve got it and they’ll make the family proud. “We’re the ones.” The Usos headed out. Reigns told Paul, “Paul, I saved you. Why didn’t you tell me that Brock was at Summerslam.” Heyman said nothing and Reigns stared at him as they cut to a break. [c](3) THE USOS vs. THE STREET PROFITS – WWE Smackdown Tag Team Title matchThe Profits ring entrance aired. Then the Usos came out. They showed Heyman and Reigns watching backstage. Montez Ford went right after the Usos at the start. The Usos came back and landed a dive onto Ford at ringside. They cut to a very early break. [c]The Profits were in control after the break and scored a two count after an assisted backdrop onto Jimmy. A screen graphic noted that Smackdown was the no. 1 trend in the United States. Ford landed a flying flip onto both Usos. McAfee exclaimed, “He cleared the top rope by five feet!” Reigns walked out. They cut to another break. [c]Ford went on a dazzling sequence of offense with only one shoe. McAfee marveled and raved. Reigns watched. Fans chanted “One shoe!” Dawkins tagged in and Ford landed a top rope blockbuster off of Dawkins’s shoulders for a near fall. Jimmy came back with a headbutt, then Jey tagged in and caught Dawkins with a superkick. They showed Reigns reacting at ringside with Heyman. A minute later, Jey landed a top rope frog splash for a convincing near fall. Reigns looked concerned. Heyman looked on the verge of a breakdown, again watching Reigns, not the match. Fans chanted, “This is awesome!” Jimmy went for a frog splash, but Dawkins lifted his knees. Ford landed a top rope splash a second later and Reigns ran in and broke up the cover. He choked out Ford. The ref called for the bell, DQing the Usos. Ford went limp as Reigns cinched on the hold long past Ford being knocked out.WINNERS: The Street Profits via DQ in 15:00.-Reigns grabbed the mic and said he ducks no man, so if Brock Lesnar wants it, he’s going to get it. He said he will smash him as soon as he’s done smashing Finn Balor. The lights went out, and when they came back on, the lights were red and augmented reality showed a red planet and lightning. Then Finn Balor showed up. Cole said it is Finn Balor’s alter ego, The Demon, showing up at Smackdown for the first time. McAfee said Reigns won’t face Balor at Extreme Rules, he’ll face The Demon. Cole explained that when Balor is pushed too far, he turns into the Demon. They had a staredown mid-ring. Balor’s new Demon look is more sinister looking than ever.(Keller’s Analysis: Really strong closing segment to the show from the match to Reigns accepting the Lesnar challenge to the appearance of the new-look Demon.)PWTORCH VIP FLASH SALETry a VIP subscription for half price – $5 off $9.99 sub or apply $5 coupon to any sub – expires in 48 hours (COUPON FIXED)4.5 hr ""The Fix w/Todd & Wade"" now available reviewing huge news week + 2 hr All Out Roundtablehttps://t.co/SuTNyp8W1n — Pro Wrestling Torch (@PWTorch) September 10, 2021Now with three payment method options… Pay Pal… Directly with your Credit or Debit Card… Or with Patreon. .EXCLUSIVE VIP BENEFITS INCLUDE…•Wade Keller Podcasts & PWTorch Dailycasts with Ads and Plugs removed•Around 75 monthly VIP-exclusive podcasts (Phone Podcast App Compatible!)•Library of around 10,000 podcasts (circa 2004-today) & 100s of retro radio shows (circa 1990s)•Over 1,600 Newsletter Back Issues: Late 1980s thru today (PDF & Text Versions)•New Weekly PWTorch Newsletter w/exclusive articles (PDF & Text Versions)•An ad-free version of PWTorch website with added VIP-Member-Only articles each week––Become a PWTorch Patreon Supporter and get all of our free podcasts (WKPWPs & Dailycasts) with ads and plugs removed for just $4.99 a month.

The SpaceX probe entered Earth's atmosphere earlier on its way back from orbit. The UK Space Agency (UKSA) originally said there was a ""low chance"" that Starlink-1855 would burn up over the UK. They now believe the satellite disintegrated during re-entry.They wrote on Twitter earlier today: “A Starlink satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere earlier today, with a low chance it may burn up over the UK very shortly.""We are monitoring its re-entry together with the MOD and there is no expectation the re-entry will cause any damage.""Jake Geer, the Head of Space Surveillance and Tracking at the UK Space Agency added: ""Today a Starlink-1855 satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere.""There is a low chance it will re-enter over the UK at around 12:18, and you might be able to spot the satellite as it burns up.""Starlink has a fantastic track record of orchestrating safe and reliable re-entries and we don't expect this satellite to cause any damage.UKSA said that there is ""always high levels of uncertainty"" when performing re-entry manoeuvres due to the varying input data, natural forces and associated observation error.They told Express.co.uk that they believe everything went smoothly this time and the satellite completely disintegrated.They stressed that it is difficult for ground-based sensors to pick up the re-entry of the satellite when this happens.But it is believed to have broken up completely and poses no threat to Britons.Starlink is a network of 1,600 satellites launched by Mr Musk's company SpaceX – designed to bring internet connectivity to hard to reach areas of the globe.SST uses sensors, usually radars, telescopes, and laser-ranging systems, to provide tracking data to reduce orbital hazards.The most dangerous events tracked are collisions in space between objects, but atmospheric re-entries of objects are also tracked.In most re-entries nothing of the object survives to reach the ground as it burns up harmlessly in the atmosphere.Re-entry locations and timing are typically difficult to predict as characteristics of the satellite, such as its attitude (the direction it's pointing in), size and mass along with a changeable atmospheric density can have large impacts on the accuracy of analysis.In recent years, more than 10 low earth orbit (LEO) satellite projects have surfaced, with Mr Musk's leading the pack.The tech giant recently tweeted that Starlink has now shipped 100,000 terminals to users in 14 countries, with license applications pending in several other countries.Rajeev Suri, the boss of British satellite company Inmarsat, recently claimed there are now too many players in the space market.He said: “I think that the industry will need consolidation.""A lot of new money is flooding into the sector.""A lot of players are willing to invest tens of billions.""We talk about Starlink, LEO [low-earth orbit] constellations, China is developing a giant constellation as part of its Belt and Road initiative.""There are too many players and a fragmented market.”",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Antarctica scientists to unlock 1.5 million-year-old 'trapped' secret with drill below ice - Daily Express

"Epic Games head Tim Sweeney responds to ruling in Apple lawsuit - Gamesradar
A major ruling has been made in the Epic vs Apple lawsuit that could have huge consequences for the App Store moving forward. An injunction issued as part of the long-running Epic vs Apple lawsuit would prevent Apple from requiring developers to use its own payment methods in App Store games and apps – a landmark ruling that could make the once-walled garden that is the App Store much more competitive. To parse that legalese, the court has essentially ruled that app and game developers can now use third-party payment methods for apps and games hosted on the App Store, thus allowing them to work around Apple's 30% transaction fee. The lawsuit had come about because Epic updated Fortnite mobile with a direct purchase option that circumvented Apple's restrictions, which saw the game removed from the iOS store. For all the case's tangents, Apple's allegedly monopolistic monetization policies have always been at the center of Epic's lawsuit. In a series of tweets, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney affirmed that ""Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers."" He also stressed that ""Today’s ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers. Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers."" Today’s ruling isn't a win for developers or for consumers. Epic is fighting for fair competition among in-app payment methods and app stores for a billion consumers. https://t.co/cGTBxThnsPSeptember 10, 2021This injunction will reinforce and add to changes which Apple recently announced . The company said it would allow developers to share information about third-party payment methods with players via external communication, but it must now allow developers to integrate those methods directly. It's worth noting that the full ruling is less clear-cut than this injunction may imply. While the court ruled ""that Apple's conduct in enforcing anti-steering restrictions is anticompetitive,"" it did not find ""that Apple is an antitrust monopolist in the submarket for mobile gaming transactions."" And though Epic is undeniably the winner today, and it's far from the only developer that will benefit from these App Store changes, it will still be forced to pay Apple 30% of the $12,167,719 in revenue that it received during the brief window that Fortnite allowed direct payments on iOS, on top of additional damages.  Of course, this won't be the end of the Epic vs Apple lawsuit. As the injunction notes, either party can seek to modify this ruling, and Apple is expected to appeal its case and bring it to a higher court. Thanks to everyone who put so much time and effort into the battle over fair competition on digital platforms, and thanks especially to the court for managing a very complex case on a speedy timeline.

Most aspects of the iPhone 13 range leaked a long time ago, but one potentially big feature only broke cover recently – very close to the planned September 14 launch of the range.We’re talking about the iPhone 13’s rumored satellite features, something that could be game-changing, inconsequential, or something in between, depending on if or how they play out.Below, we’ll look at exactly what these satellite features might be, and which versions of the rumor – if any – are likely to happen.As widespread as 4G is, and as fast as 5G networks are growing, there are still loads of areas that don’t have any signal on some or even any carriers, and that’s something that the iPhone 13’s satellite features could solve.According to , the iPhone 13 range will have a customized Qualcomm X60 baseband modem chip, which would allows calls and texts to be transmitted via a satellite network, rather than over 5G, 4G or 3G.This claim came from Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with an excellent track record for Apple information, and they added that Apple is likely to leverage Globalstar’s satellite network to power this.This could be an enormous upgrade, meaning that wherever you are you’d be able to stay in touch with people – and it could be especially useful in emergencies, or for countries that don’t have great cellular coverage.That said, this initial report was light on details – there was no information on whether many apps would be able to tap into this or not, or on how widely it would be offered.Satellite networks are also inevitably going to be slower than 5G or even 4G, so this is unlikely to be your main form of communication, even if it does launch in an unrestricted form.As promising as that first leak sounded, subsequent leaks have poured a little cold water on it. Almost immediately after the story broke, numerous people suggested Kuo’s claims were inaccurate, as reported by MacRumors.Kuo specifically mentioned Globalstar’s n53 spectrum (also known as Band 53), yet this is used for terrestrial coverage – not satellite communications.Others have therefore suggested that while Apple may well partner with Globalstar and tap into the company’s n53 spectrum, this would instead just mean adding another radio band to 4G or 5G services.That could improve the performance on conventional 4G and 5G networks, but wouldn’t allow for satellite communications.Yet the story doesn’t end there. We’ve now heard from Mark Gurman (another great source for Apple leaks) that Kuo might have been on to something, but that the satellite communications could be more limited than it originally seemed.Gurman claims that satellite communications are planned, but only “in areas without any cellular coverage and only in select markets.” Beyond that, these satellite communications will apparently be limited to short emergency texts and SOS distress signals, so this would purely be something to use in emergencies.These emergency messages would apparently appear in grey in the iOS Messages app, and the system would supposedly only work outside, and could take up to a minute to establish a connection, so don’t expect it to be slick.Still, even in this form these satellite features could be enormously useful, and potentially life-saving for anyone who’s had an accident or got lost or stranded somewhere without cellular signal.Gurman additionally claims that while the iPhone 13 might have the hardware required for this, the feature won’t be enabled until sometime next year, so don’t expect to be able to use satellite communications at launch.At this point we can’t say with any certainty what, if any, satellite features Apple has planned for the iPhone 13 range, especially given the conflicting rumors.That said, unrestricted satellite communications sounds very unlikely, so if we do see it then something along the lines of what Gurman predicts is probably most likely.Indeed, given Gurman’s excellent track record we suspect he might be right – but that doesn’t rule out the use of n53 spectrum for terrestrial services too. It’s possible that both rumors are right, and Kuo may have got the two mixed up, or simply been trying to mention both of them without making the distinction clear.Whatever the case, there could be bigger satellite features planned for future iPhones. Apple reportedly plans to launch its own satellite network at some point – something we first heard about back in 2017, then again in 2019, and have recently heard reiterated by Gurman.This might eventually allow for full satellite connectivity, but it’s likely at least several years away, and may require Apple to overcome other hurdles beyond building the network – the required smartphone hardware could be bulky, and carriers might not be too happy. So don’t expect this to happen for a while if at all.Thank you for signing up to TechRadar. You will receive a verification email shortly.There was a problem.

, Facebook has partnered with EssilorLuxottica to produce Ray-Ban Stories, one of the first potentially viable attempts at mass-market smart glasses. They are similar in some ways to early iterations of Snapchat Spectacles but with a more stylish aesthetic that looks right in line with other Ray-Ban glasses.Photos and videos taken with the glasses are sent to a new smartphone app called Facebook View, which offers essential editing and sharing capabilities. In addition to photo and video capture, the glasses allow you to take calls or listen to music and podcasts with built-in speakers and microphones.The Ray-Ban Stories are equipped with a Snapdragon processor, but they don't have displays in the lenses, so these are by no means augmented reality (AR) glasses.The glasses, which Facebook says weigh about five grams more than other typical Ray-Ban glasses, come in five colors and three different frame styles, and there are multiple lens options, including prescription, clear, transition, polarized, and sun. Facebook and Ray-Ban say the glasses will get about one day of battery life when it comes to just walking around and taking pictures, but listening to streaming audio will drop that down to just three hours. The glasses come with an AirPods-style charging case that allows you to stretch that out to as much as three days without a power outlet.Given Mark Zuckerberg's past statements about the importance of AR for Facebook's future, the Internet is abuzz with speculation about what this means for the social network's AR strategy.Our take: not much. These aren't true AR glasses by any definition, and practical AR wearables in this natural-looking form factor are still a few years away from being technologically achievable. There's nothing in this announcement about APIs that will help developers work with Facebook to lay the foundation for future AR experiences.Contrast that with Snap (whose admittedly  can actually be used by content creators to develop new kinds of mixed-reality content) or Apple (whose ever-expanding  for the iPhone and iPad will eventually be translatable to wearable devices).So no, Stories aren't really an AR story. This is just a smart glasses story. But that doesn't mean smart glasses won't ""be a thing"" in the near future. The runaway success of AirPods, Fitbit wrist devices, and other products suggests that wearables could just be getting started.Facebook and Ray-Ban's smart glasses go on sale today at most retail and e-commerce outlets that already sell other Ray-Ban glasses, and they start at $299. Stories are available in Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Update: We previously wrote that the glasses weigh five grams, but the actual statement from Facebook said that the glasses weigh five grams more than typical Ray-Ban glasses. We have corrected the error above.Listing image by FacebookYou must  to comment.", https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1583248045.jpg,"This Samsung A12 tariff puts flagship phones to shame at just £14 a month - Techradar
If you're on the hunt for a cheap phone contract, a recent offer from the retailer Chitter Chatter could be perfect. It offers a Samsung handset with a big data cap, far below the prices of most of the brand's other devices.This deal offers up Samsung's Galaxy A12. While it is by no means one of Samsung's best devices falling into its cheapest brackets, it does offer a really well-rounded performance for its price.You'll only pay £14 a month while getting an impressive 30GB of data plan, plus unlimited calls and texts. That kind of tariff would cost you around £35/40 a month on the Samsung Galaxy S21, £35 on the iPhone 12, and even around £26 a month on a more affordable handset like the OnePlus Nord 2.In fact, this tariff only costs slightly more than buying a 30GB of data SIM plan on its own. If you're simply after a cheap tariff, you'll find it tough to beat this for value and phone performance.Samsung Galaxy A12: 
If you're simply after a cheap phone contract and don't mind what device it is, this will be the perfect option. It doesn't cost a penny upfront, and then your monthly bills follow at just £14. That gets you 30GB of data - plenty for gaming, downloads, lots of streaming, and general use of your phone throughout the day. Few SIM only deals can get you this much data for less than this, making this a bit of a steal.
View DealDespite its cheap price tag, the Samsung Galaxy A12 has a lot going for it. Mainly, it has a giant battery, beating out most smartphones on the market with a 5000mAh battery - that will easily get you through a day with juice leftover.Like a lot of more affordable handsets, it also comes with expandable storage and a headphone jack - two factors that are rare on handsets these days. However, to get the lower price, this device does make some sacrifices.It uses a weaker processing chip than a lot of Samsung's devices, and the camera performance lags behind some of its similarly-priced competitors. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A12 makes some big cutbacks to afford its price, but for those after a simple smartphone, this will work for you.As the editor of all things broadband, SIMs and phone contracts, Alex is constantly scouring the internet to land you the best prices.

Coverage begins at 8pm.Free-to-air Channel 4 has secured an 11th-hour agreement with Amazon to share the broadcast, meaning tennis fans will be able to cheer on 18-year-old Raducanu as she makes her first Grand Slam final appearance against Canadian Leylah Fernandez without subscribing to Amazon.Raducanu is the first British woman to reach a Grand Slam singles final since Virginia Wade at Wimbledon in 1977.Coverage will begin on Prime Video at 8pm BST, with pre-match analysis from Greg Rusedski, Daniela Hantuchova and Anne Keothavong in the Prime Video Studio, ahead of a 9pm start from the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows.Match commentary will come from Mark Petchey, Martina Navratilova, as well as Tim Henman courtside and Jim Courier providing analysis from Flushing Meadows.Prime Video said it will reinvest all fees from the Channel 4 agreement into British women’s tennis to support the next generation of female British talent.Prime Video has also worked with the BBC to deliver match highlights of the US Open women’s singles final on the BBC on Sunday afternoon.Alex Green, managing director of Prime Video Sport Europe, said: ""Emma’s journey from qualification through to the US Open final at the age of 18 is a truly magical story for British sport and we think it’s important that we extend our coverage to as many people as possible to support her in this historic moment for women’s tennis.""Young tennis talent such as Emma need the right support to become the stars we see today and we’re delighted to be able to commit even more investment to the next generation of women’s tennis in the UK.""Ian Katz, chief content officer for Channel 4, said: ""Emma’s meteoric rise to secure a place in the US Open Final is just sensational.""We’re glad to have worked with Prime Video and pulled out all the stops to get it on air and I’m sure viewers will be thrilled at the prospect of watching Emma in this Grand Slam final.""We didn’t know we’d secured the deal until late on Friday night and so many people have gone above and beyond to make it happen. But Channel 4 is all about finding ways to let our viewers share great national moments, whether it’s Bake Off or big sporting events like the cricket World Cup final or US Open final.""",https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article21542555.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1339512412jpgday-1.jpg,"Prince Andrew’s lawyers dispute service of legal papers by Virginia Giuffre’s team - The Independent
Lawyers for Prince Andrew have raised questions about how legal papers were served in the sexual assault case being brought by Virginia Giuffre.Ms Giuffre’s legal team claimed it had served papers on him relating to a case in America by handing them to a Metropolitan Police officer on duty in Windsor last month.Documents filed in a New York court said this was “consistent with the provisions for service upon an individual defendant, under Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Rules, as required by the Supreme Court of Judicature in England and Wales”.However, Blackfords, who said they represented the Duke of York “in certain UK matters”, queried that assertion in a letter on 6 September. They wrote: “We reiterate that our client reserves all his rights, including to contest the jurisdiction of the US courts (including on the basis of potentially defective service).”They added Ms Guiffre’s claim may not be viable, citing a 2009 release in a separate court case in Florida. Ms Giuffre’s lawyers called this an “erroneous suggestion”.Ms Giuffre alleges the Queen's second son sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager. She claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender and Andrew's former friend, to have sex with the duke when she was 17 and a minor under US law. Andrew has strenuously denied all the allegations.In documents filed to the US district court for the southern district of New York on Friday, Ms Giuffre’s lawyers said there was a first attempt to serve the papers on the duke on 26 August, when an agent went to Windsor Great Park.They state that a Metropolitan Police officer at the Royal Lodge, who was the head of security, told the agent officers were not able to accept service of any court process, or let anyone trying to serve legal papers into the property.The agent returned the next day and was told the court process could be left with the police officer at the main gate “and that this matter would then be forwarded on to the legal team”.The document said the complaint, the summons and other papers were packaged together “in a plastic sleeve and then in an A4 envelope, addressed to the said defendant, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, at the address” and then given to the police officer.It said that within 21 days of the summons the plaintiff must be served an answer to the complaint, and “if you fail to respond, judgment by default will be entered against you for the relief demanded in the complaint”.On Friday ABC News reported apparent further details of Blackfords’ 6 September letter. Gary Bloxsome, a partner at the firm, wrote that a number of attempted services of the papers by Ms Giuffre’s team had been “irregular” and “in at least one case accompanied by a media representative”, the broadcaster reported. He called this “regrettable”.Mr Bloxsome reportedly wrote that in his view, requests for cooperation from British courts must be made by an American judicial or diplomatic officer, not the plaintiff’s lawyer.A US judge will ultimately determine whether the papers were properly delivered. Judge Lewis Kaplan will hold the first pre-trial conference in the case via teleconference on Monday.Andrew has stepped back from public duties amid the fallout from his relationship with Epstein. His withdrawal came after a 2019 Newsnight interview which saw him attempt to draw a line under his relationship with Epstein, who died in prison two years ago, but which only resulted in more negative headlines.Reports said Andrew was currently staying at Balmoral, the Queen’s Scotland retreat.A representative of the duke declined to comment when contacted by The Independent.Buckingham Palace declined to comment.Additional reporting by agenciesWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
