"2022 NFL Scouting Combine winners and losers, Day 4: Sauce Gardner, Zyon McCollum show out - NFL.com
Draft AnalystINDIANAPOLIS -- Readers of my 2022 NFL Scouting Combine recaps from Thursday, Friday and Saturday night might wonder why I didn't just pick the players with the fastest 40-yard dashes and farthest jumps as winners.I didn't base my selection solely on those results because the combine is a football evaluation event, not the national decathlon team trials. Athleticism testing matters, but so do the movement skills and natural athleticism shown by top players on the Lucas Oil Stadium turf during position drills.Test results can reflect a player's speed, agility, natural bend and flexibility, but seeing those attributes in a competitive football setting (even one without pads) can reveal a players' skills in ways that even three-cone drills and short shuttles do not.This is especially true of defensive backs, who took the field Sunday afternoon to show off their pure speed and change-of-direction skills. The ""winners"" listed below exceeded expectations with their efforts while the ""losers"" couldn't take advantage of the opportunity to improve their draft stock.This former Terrapin took advantage of his opportunity at the combine after declaring for the draft as an underclassman. His 4.34 40-yard time (1st among safeties), 37-inch vertical (4th) and 10-foot-10 broad jump (3rd) all belied his thick 6-foot-1, 212-pound frame. It was tough not to notice his combination of strength and agility throughout the on-field drills. Cross was fluid and fast in his pedal and transition in the ""W"" drill, and caught nearly everything. There's a tough competition brewing to be among the top four safeties in this year's draft, and Cross made a strong case he's deserving of that honor.Every offensive coordinator in college football knew to stay away from Sauce. Now, NFL teams know he has the athleticism to add flavor to their defense. His 4.41 40-yard dash checked the long speed box. Gardner's hips and agility were just fine during drills, moving laterally and backpedaling with speed despite measuring over 6-foot-3 with an excellent 79 3/8-inch wingspan. Some teams may not like his lean 190-pound frame, but his length and competitive nature will likely entice someone to pick him early in the first round.McCollum was one of my favorite non-FBS prospects heading into the 2021 season, and his combine performance cemented his status as a late-third or early-fourth round selection. He ran an outstanding 4.33 40 at 6-foot-2, 199 pounds and jumped 39.5 inches vertically. McCollum also displayed speed and agility on the field, flipping his hips adeptly for a corner his size. He missed a couple of catch opportunities but reeled in enough to show he can convert interceptions. McCollum was the only player from his combine group to run the short shuttle (3.94 seconds) and three-cone drill (6.48), and he excelled at both. Cornerback Cobie Durant from South Carolina State (4.38 40) and safety Markquese Bell from Florida A&M (4.41) were two other non-FBS defenders who also ran well and looked fluid in workouts.Running a 4.38 40 at 196 pounds helped Taylor-Britt's cause to be selected among the top 100 picks in April. He had one of the best performances on the floor, as well, changing directions and catching everything in sight. Taylor-Britt transitioned forward from his backpedal more smoothly than I expected. I thought he might have to move to safety in the NFL, but Sunday's workout and his time at the Reese's Senior Bowl indicate he has the speed and hip fluidness to stay outside at the next level.The 2021 Jim Thorpe Award winner (top collegiate defensive back) ran a 4.54 40-yard dash at 193 pounds, which is acceptable but looked pedestrian with so many of his fellow defensive backs running in the 4.3s and 4.4s. He adjusted well to the ball when it was thrown his way in drills, but the rest of his workout was ordinary. Bryant looked only adequate in terms of hip fluidity, backpedal speed and change of direction on ""W"" drills and when shifting from one hash to the other. I suspect he'll be a solid NFL player but his work in Indianapolis will not help him break into Day 2 of the draft.Waller weighed in at just 180 pounds, making him one of the lighter defensive backs in Indy, but he tied for the slowest 40 time in his combine group (4.68) and did not perform the broad or vertical jumps. Waller showed some quickness during drills, but a lack of hip fluidity was apparent as he tried to change directions. His ball skills were only average, as well. I think he could be a serviceable zone corner at the next level, but he didn't help himself with his performance on Sunday.Follow Chad Reuter on Twitter.Get exclusive access to the offseason for $9.99Go behind the scenes and watch the offseason like never before.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/private/t_thumb_squared/t_lazy/f_png/league/t7d97z0lxqqwdp0uwarr.png,"Lakers Notes: LeBron, Caruso, Vogel, Magic, Augustin, Gabriel - hoopsrumors.com
LeBron James dropped 56 points on the Warriors Saturday night, leading the Lakers to a 124-116 win and ending a four-game losing streak, . James shot 19-of-31 from the field, 6-of-11 from three, and 12-of-13 from the line while adding 10 rebounds and three assists in nearly 39 minutes of action.The 56-point effort tied Trae Young‘s NBA season-high and is the most points LeBron has scored in a game for Los Angeles, Buha notes. James said he was just happy to get a win.“It’s funny, our guys were following me off the floor tonight going into the locker room and they asked me, ‘How does it feel to score 56?’” James said. “I said, ‘Right now, I don’t give a damn about the 56. I’m just happy we got a win.’ That’s just literally the first thing that came to my mind.”“There’s really no words for it,” coach Frank Vogel said of James’ 56-point game. “An incredible performance by the best to ever do it, in my opinion, and as I’ve said.”The Lakers have had an undeniably disappointing season, barely clinging to the No. 9 seed in the West with a 28-35 record, but James has been consistently great on offense. He’s now tied with Giannis Antetokounmpo for second in the league in scoring with 29.4 points per game, just a tenth of a point behind Joel Embiid‘s league-leading 29.5. It’s James’ highest scoring average since 2009/10.Here’s more on the Lakers:Let Westbrook play in China and get triple double every night and break every record.  He will be happy!i’d expect quadruple and some quintuple doubles and nothing less.IMOLakers can still beat Suns in the first roundLakers ceiling is 8th seed oPrediction – If LBJ’s not wearing a Lakers uniform next year it will be a Warrior uniform not a CavaliersNot hidden is his admiration for Curry and likewise how’d they would play better.
 A little extra juice may have been applied last night by LBJ  to show GSW he’s worth the package (w signing a 2 yr ext) in the offseason Haters will hate but they do already regardless , do anything you want  LeBron just be concise and steady with the decision when you ultimately make it (which will have to be quick) . Watching Kobe pile up loses late career was difficult, I think most Laker fans wouldn’t hold it against LBJ if he moved on for higher waters as we appreciate greatness and will be a mess next year ultimately wasting one of LBJ’s last great  yearsTHAT will never happen because W’s already have Kerr as HC, and Myers as GM. Everyone knows Lebron is the HC and GM of Lakers.  He even doesnt mind Westbrook because it takes pressure off him and he can just focus on scoring without stress.  LBJ is done with winning – he’s into career scoring record, all star and all nba teams, making money on and off the court, and owning nba team when he retires.Even if the rubbish you spilled were true people and priorities change every year The Warriors and LBJ have one vital thing  in common
 – They both increase their title chances together, that’s how/why this gets done. They bolt up to the best team in the league next year….Are they that Now? Not to mention how beautiful they’d be on the court, that dynamic ball movement would hit 6th gear nightly. Stephs looks get better, Klay will be wide openI saw at least 90% of the Showtime Laker games when Magic was the catalyst. He was the best point guard I’ve ever seen – none close. He was the first to “pass guys open” – over a decade before NFL QB’s figured that out. And multiple times a year Chick Hearn would say: “Coach Riley has asked Magic to shoot more often”. Imagine a “point guard” doing that today – looking for an open teammate instead of giving up the ball because the clock is running down and he doesn’t have a shot. Magic comes from another era. Where fans talked about how teams were playing and not how much money individual players were making and could make in the future. The Lakers are no longer the Lakers. Maybe that will change in the future, they’ve lost their way at times in the past. They’re just another large market team trying to put together a Big 3 of overpaid veterans and then having to scrimp around to build a “supporting cast” because they don’t have much payroll space left. Hard as it may be for him, Magic needs to stay back at this point as Jerry West has done at times and is doing now. He’s not wrong in his observations, but they won’t do any good and frustrated fans will dump on him.I”magine a “point guard” doing that today – looking for an open teammate instead of giving up the ball because the clock is running down and he doesn’t have a shot.”Rubio, Rondo, and of course, Simmons. all fit that pass first profile today.Giddey and CP3 ……
Magic was the best.Let’s not forget one of the best Point Guards today – Draymond Green!  :)Along with Denver’s 6’11” 284 lb PG who was asked to be more assertive because he passed his teammates instead of just scoring himself.Melo and Lonzo Ball both look to pass first as well.@ Cap & Crunch ;James is not a fee agent. Cleveland is not about to give up 2-3 young, controlled, cheap, quality players and a couple of draft choices to get the guy.In a way, the same for the Warriors. The Lakers need to build a young core of players. The Warriors are currently trying to do a rebuild on the fly. There’s no match there.The truth is that James has painted himself into a corner. His son is a freshman in HS in the LA area – majoring in playing basketball. James is not about to move his family the next few years. He wants to win a championship? He best shot is with the Clippers. He can stay in LA and be a part of the unveiling of the Intuit Dome. The Clippers owner is lost. All he seems able to do is throw money around trying to win. James can hope Kawhi Leonard and Paul George will be healthy the next year or two, and with an owner that will be happy to go over the salary cap to a point of being censured by the league they’ll pay “supporting cast” players to do the dirty work.–  James isn’t a FA, ya dont say – Warriors are by no means rebuilding – The Wiggins match/upgrade will be done in the summer…can’t think of a better player than LBJ to fit that squad…there’s other deals, sure; but there {could} also be this one Cle- would be giving up Lauri Sexton(S&T)  and Okoro ….not much too miss for a top 10 player. They don’t fall off trees Clippers have no above water assets, no picks , so No, that’s not even remotely feasible ….and the owner is very happy over the cap already if you didn’t notice  Painted into a corner- Kind of, but not really, I ultimately think he will stay (75%+) but if he were to leave GSW makes more sense than Cle and the Lakers get a better package from GSW than they would Cle so Im all about thatLeBron today is better than peak Draymond…Does that not sound like something that would at least warrant GSW’s attention? With a 2 yr extension to boot?Very poor fit in W’s system and culture where you have to attend practices and meetings, and buy into the system.  LBJ can either stay in LA or go find few teams that dont have GM, HC, or a culture.  LBJ is an iconic figure who is no longer just a basketball player, and has his own agenda.  No thank you.When has LeBron not attended practices or meetings or messed up a system? Never….System fit- I disagree 100% , LeBrons favorite play is reading the D,  finding an open shooter, then Splash or Splash Bros in this instance . I think he’d fit like a gloveComical.  Lebron will only leave the Lakers to play with his son.  I lived in Northern Cali for 15 unfortunate years.  Never met one Warriors fan.  Those “fans” couldn’t be more fairweather.Fans ain’t appreciating the greatness of LBJ right now!
Dude is like in the MVP convo at age 37 & playing at his highest level ever… again at 37!!!I’m glad I’ve been privileged to see Lebron’s whole career, an unbelievable player. I don’t get into ‘who’s the best’ discussions because they’re totally irrelevant given that all of the names tossed around played in different eras.I can’t help but feel these last few years have dampened his legacy. From the last couple of years in Cleveland and these past years in L.A I never got the sense he was part of a team. It was just James doing his thing surrounded by ring chasers. I think he would have really cemented a lasting relationship with Laker fans had he taken the time to develop the young team he signed with as a free agent. That impatience to be in the record books is what I think people find off-putting.That could have been a lineup of some combination of Ball, Ingram, Randle, Kuzma, Zubac, Caruso, Hart, Wagner, Payton Jr. etc. Preferable to the current team and would have proved ‘James makes his teammates better’.jbl sounds like your pet peeve is AD not LJ.The some combination part is easier said than done 1 mistep leads to 2 etc  There was probably always a consolidation trade brewingAs X states it’s more of a reflection on how much AD has left on the table the last 2 years. He stays healthy the tune changes.The cynicism of old man Sam is impossible to match by someone who enjoys watching NBA and has not given up on it.BTW the phrase “throwing the receiver open” occured in the NFL long before it was coined that way… it just was not called that.  The “innovation” was just the phrase invention.Dan Fouts of the Chargers 1973-1987 (Don Coryell HC), was said to complete passes to covered receivers, by the receivers bending their routes deeper after cutting when the ball was still in the air, and Fouts throwing high.  This was by the early 80s, mostly before “showtime”, though Magic J may have been throwing bounce passes so they bounce high before that (his thing).Soccer players of course have been “passing” receivers open as a normal skill for many decades before.As usual, when Samuel posts, corrections to his lies have to be made or people are misinformed.Also there are many pass-first PGs and many who are encouraged to shoot more.  It depends on shooting skill.  Magic J of course was challenged in that area, so passing to Wilkes, Jabbar, Worthy, etc. was a better option.And after its all over… So what?  Samuel adds nothing but a guy whose time has passed… even if the story is true.The Dodgers pay luxury tax. The Rams would if that was a thing in the NFL. Lakers should be ashamed of themselves for not wanting to pay it. They are a primer franchise.Lakers two big concerns.
1. Getting rid of Russ
2. LeBron being old and potentially leaving relatively soonYour going to need a core or atleast something once Bron leaves. Without him your literally nothing. So you need to get a haul of multiple pieces for Russ and preferably not all old guys. My ideas
1. The ideal rebuild
Lakers- Randle, Fouriner, Kemba, White and Noel
Knicks- Russ, Vuce and a first (LA)
Bulls- AD and Nunn 2. The simple reload
Lakers-Randle Walker and either Noel or Burks
Knicks-Russ and 2 seconds 3. The obvious option
Lakers- Wall and Wood
Rockets- Russ, Nunn and a first 4. Absolutely dreaming
Lakers- Kyrie
Nets- Russ and 2 first round picks 1 deal is just simply and make sense. Lakers get a bunch of new player and all seem to be a better fit. Knicks I think would be very happy and Bulls would be happy. AD himself would be happy and I think Russ would be happy too.
Second deal is just if Chicago isn’t interested but then at the same time AD and Randle aren’t a fit and you’d then likely see one of them moved on again in another trade. Third deal is similar to what the teams divided at the deadline. Lakers didn’t want to include a first and fair enough. They come back in the offseason and say okay we will give you the first and either Nunn or THT if you throw in Wood who would have an expiring deal and for the Rockets in a rebuild would not be in the long term plans and unlikely resigned anyway. They then choose Nunn over THT. The last deal is just a dream. But if Kyrie decides hey sorry KD but we can’t win a chip I’m going back to Bron. Kyrie Bron and AD make the big three. Russ and KD link up again plus another couple first round picks. Very very very unlikely but just an idea",https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/images/graphics/app-stores-opt2.jpg,"As NFL scouting combine winds down, all eyes are on Aaron Rodgers and an important deadline - Yahoo Sports
INDIANAPOLIS — When it comes to , the last day at the NFL scouting combine was illuminating on two points.First, it appears only Rodgers knows what he’s doing.Second, Tuesday’s franchise tag deadline at 4 p.m. ET for wideout Davante Adams is going to be a significant moment, tipping precisely how committed the Green Bay Packers are in laying a foundation for Rodgers’ return. Most especially if Rodgers hasn’t informed the team of his decision by the tagging deadline, arguably showcasing to the quarterback that Green Bay is willing to make a major hope-based decision to keep him before he has made his commitment.Regardless of how that unfolds, what became clear over the past week is that nobody has a firm grasp on what Rodgers has been planning. That includes franchises interested in pursuing him if he seeks a trade, executives tasked with constructing trade offers and contract extensions, players impacted by Rodgers’ decision, and even some associates who have previously been in the quarterback’s circle. The assessment from that wide array of parties is that through Sunday, Rodgers hadn’t showcased a lean to anyone. Whether he’s preparing for a departure from Green Bay, a trade elsewhere or a retirement that nobody seems to expect, the  has kept his process remarkably under wraps. So much so that one source deeply invested in the outcome of the decision described his approach heading into next week as “just let it happen.”That source isn’t alone, either. Indeed, if there was a bottom line for all the franchises speculated to be involved, the simplest way to describe it is this: Neither the Packers nor Denver Broncos have any clue what Rodgers is going to do, and the Tennessee Titans and Pittsburgh Steelers are privately saying they do not have trade packages or contract extensions cooked up for a pursuit of Rodgers.Even as opaque as the situation is, there is a shared belief between all four of those teams that Rodgers’ decision is going to come down to Green Bay and Denver, and that when it’s all over, he’s likely to sign a two-year contract extension making him the highest-paid player in the NFL.Now everyone is waiting for Tuesday’s franchise tag “tell” to materialize with the Packers and Adams, which will showcase Green Bay’s intent to keep Rodgers’ top target in the fold for 2022. And while some in the media have suggested it could be a tag-and-trade move allowing the Packers to deal both Rodgers and Adams together, one executive not in play for either player was incredulous about that scenario.“Sending players and [draft] picks — whoever is getting [Rodgers and Adams] together would have to be sending both players and picks — that would be one of the biggest trades in NFL history or close to it,” the executive said. “Then there’s the [contract] extensions, which Rodgers is probably the highest-paid player in the NFL next [season] and Davante Adams is going to be the richest total wide receiver deal ever done. Trading and paying the back-to-back MVP is hard enough and [media] are throwing in probably the best or second-best receiver in like it’s fantasy football.”That doesn’t mean such a move is impossible, of course. Every trade or asset burn is unprecedented until someone engineers it (see the Los Angeles Rams), but the reality is the path to keeping Rodgers and Adams together continues to make the most sense for Green Bay. If that doesn’t come together, the first step would be a decision from Rodgers, who could be traded and work out a new deal with a team after the new league year begins at 4 p.m. ET on March 16. If Rodgers requests a trade, the Packers would still have options with Adams, including a contract extension, trading him alone to another team, the aforementioned mega trade, letting him play out a tagged season, or rescinding the tag altogether and letting him depart in free agency.However it breaks down, this week represents the traction moment for everyone involved. Packers free agents are set to make decisions, Adams' future will have some clarity, and any teams interested in trading for Rodgers will be willing to back-burner their secondary options at quarterback for only so long. One way or another, this is going to come to a head. Rodgers also makes his weekly guest appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Tuesday, which suddenly seems like the perfect opportunity for everything to be revealed at once.That means Rodgers will own the news cycle for at least the next few days. Whether that stretches on for weeks or even the rest of the offseason has everything to do with his decision. If he stays, the band gets back together as much as the Packers can make that happen. If he leaves, it will have an NFL domino effect that we’ll be talking about all the way into training camps in July.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png
"U.S. oil prices soar Sunday, briefly punching above $130 as talk of Russia oil embargo heats up - MarketWatch
Values for U.S. oil soared Sunday evening, driving prices above $125 a barrel in electronic trade as discussions about a ban on Russian oil heated up. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday the U.S. was considering an embargo of Russian oil imports “in coordination” with European and NATO allies in response to Moscow’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Blinken said the White House is reviewing the prospect of banning Russian oil imports, in coordination with European allies, while attempting to mitigate the impact of any such ban on global supplies, which could drive already-lofty prices further higher. Also read: “We’ve seen the ruble in free fall. We see the economy heading into a deep recession. We’ve already had a major impact, but we are looking, again, as we speak, in coordination with allies and partners at this prospect of banning oil imports,” he told NBC News. Russia is one of the biggest producers of crude oil, and sanctions its oil are viewed as holding the possibility of rippling through markets. That said, there has already been an implicit ban of Russian crude, with prospective buyers shunning crude out of Russia. Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a Thursday report, noted that Russian oil is facing an de facto embargo as the U.S. and its allies have imposed tough sanctions on major Russian banks, blocking them from the crucial SWIFT interbank messaging service for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The sanctions avoided crude sanctions amid rising inflation being faced by the U.S. and much of the world but momentum around enacting an energy ban is building, as Western nations aim to curb the Kremlin’s military campaign in Ukraine and cripple it financially. Croft said that Russia’s “already staggering” export losses could hit 3 million to 4 million barrels a day if Western powers follow through and impose the sort of energy-focused “secondary sanctions” that were aimed at Iran.Read more: Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported on Sunday that  for all regions, hiking its Arab Light crude for next month’s shipments to Asia to $4.95 a barrel above the benchmark it uses.Doubts about achieving a nuclear disarmament agreement between Iran and world powers also was helping to push prices of crude higher, Reuters reported, with doubts mounting that such a deal, which could see Tehran pour fresh supply onto the market, could be reached soon.

"Covid-positive deer may be harboring the virus and infecting humans, study says - Salon
Aside from saving human lives in the immediate moment, the other fundamental reason that public health officials were pushing mass vaccination to slow the spread of COVID-19 is because the more hosts in which a virus resides, the more likely the virus is to eventually mutate into something more virulent. Obviously, that has happened at least twice so far with SARS-CoV-2: first with the ultra-contagious delta variant, and then later with the . Currently, the number of human hosts in the U.S. is waning as the . If we are lucky, that may imply that this wave of infections is over, and while the coronavirus will continue to circulate (and mutate) as it becomes endemic, it would have fewer hosts in which to do so. Or, at least human hosts. As we know, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have circulated in bats and pangolins before crossing over to humans. We also know that the virus spread back into animals, presumably through humans: dogs, cats, a zoo lion, and appear to have been infected by humans.Ominously, the infection trend may now be going the other way. A recent Canadian study raises the possibility that deer — one of the most ubiquitous large mammals in North America — may have infected humans with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. That would imply the virus circulated for a while in deer, reproducing and occasionally mutating on its way, before jumping back into people.RELATED: The new study provides evidence that deer may have infected humans, although it is not definitively proven. Conducted by more than two dozen scientists across Ontario and posted on the database bioRxiv (it has not yet been peer reviewed), the study included 300 samples from white-tailed deer in Canada during the final months of 2021. Seventeen of those deer tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, all of them from southwestern Ontario. The scientists discovered that this same strain of SARS-CoV-2, which is highly divergent from other known strains, was also highly similar to a SARS-CoV-2 virus that had infected a human. (It was also closely related to a strain found among humans in Michigan in late 2020.) While the scientists cannot confirm that the virus had been transmitted to the human by a deer, they know that the human lived in the same geographic area as deer and had been in close contact with deer during the same time when the infected samples were collected.That said, the sample size is very small and no one has definitively proved that the deer gave the virus to the human. There is also no evidence that the person with the mutant SARS-CoV-2 virus passed it on to anyone else, and initial experiments suggests the new virus would not be able to evade antibodies. In other words, if it did spread among people, individuals who are vaccinated would likely be safe.Finally, because the deer-based SARS-CoV-2 virus is such an unknown, there is no reason to believe yet that it presents any kind of increased risk to humans. The bigger concern is that, because viruses can evolve in animals, there is the possibility that it could turn into something more dangerous.""The virus is evolving in deer and diverging in deer away from what we are clearly seeing evolving in humans,"" Samira Mubareka, a virologist at Sunnybrook Research Institute and the University of Toronto and an author of the new paper, told The New York Times. After fully sequencing the genomes from five of the infected deer, the scientists discovered many mutations that had not been previously documented. They also found 76 mutations that set the new version of SARS-CoV-2 from the original version of the virus. Some of those mutations had been previously discovered in other infected animals like mink.Shortly before this study was published, a separate group of scientists announced that Pennsylvania deer may have continued to be infected with the Alpha variant even after it disappeared in humans — and that it evolved within them as they continued to spread it. This further reinforces the concern about deer incubating SARS-CoV-2 viruses.The SARS-CoV-2 virus is believed to have originated in in a horseshoe bat. At some point, the virus is thought to have been transmitted to another animal through one or many ""spillover events,"" and then eventually found its way to a human host. Bats are notorious for serving as hosts to dangerous coronaviruses because their immune systems are unusually aggressive. This means that viruses which live in bats need to evolve and replicate more quickly in order to survive.""The bottom line is that bats are potentially special when it comes to hosting viruses,"" Mike Boots, a disease ecologist and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology, told Science Daily in 2020. ""It is not random that a lot of these viruses are coming from bats. Bats are not even that closely related to us, so we would not expect them to host many human viruses. But this work demonstrates how bat immune systems could drive the virulence that overcomes this.""For more on animals and COVID-19, please read:Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer for Salon.

Look at the dates: 1890-1918; 1878-1918; 1896-1918; 1917-1918 ... Every person buried on this snowy slope in Barre, Vt, died within days, weeks of each other. ""It's pretty humbling,"" said Brian Zecchinelli.Nearly 200 died that Fall during that other pandemic, the 1918 so-called Spanish Flu. Zecchinelli and his wife, Karen, own the nearby Wayside Restaurant now. It's become a Vermont institution. ""Effie Ballou opened the Wayside in July of 1918, and two months later the pandemic hits Barre,"" he said. Zecchinelli has never stopped thinking about how little he knew about the 1918 flu – and the fact that the grandfather he never met was one of its victims. He died at 35, on October 10 of that terrible year. Germinio Zecchinelli, like so many other Italian stone cutters, had moved to Barre to quarry granite, to carve the nation's gravestones (and often each others', as it turned out).""The Spanish Flu is often referred to as the 'forgotten flu,'"" Zecchinelli told correspondent Martha Teichner. ""And if we had anything to do with it, it wasn't gonna be forgotten, Germinio and all the others. We wanted to do something to memorialize him and the 50 million others worldwide that died.""Because, to his astonishment, there was no substantial monument – anywhere – in spite of the staggering number of dead. The forgotten pandemic, indeed. So, in 2018, a century after the fact, Zecchinelli commissioned this one. ""It is unbelievable that nothing else had been done,"" he said.""Six-hundred-seventy-five thousand Americans died in that pandemic. We're at nearly a million and counting dead from COVID.  Has history taught us anything?Tulane University scholar John Barry, who wrote the definitive history of the 1918 flu, ""The Great Influenza,"" said, ""This time around it confirmed the lesson from 1918: you tell the truth.""You heard things like - this is all about the 1918 virus - 'This is ordinary influenza by another name,' which of course, it wasn't. It's crystal clear that Trump himself knowingly said things that weren't true"" (such as : ""It's going to disappear. One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear"").And what did confusion over the constantly-evolving science do to trust and compliance? (Dr. Anthony Fauci's March 8, 2020 statement, ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" vs. Fauci's Oct. 29, 2020 support for community COVID protocols, ""the flagship of which is wearing a mask."")""You know, trust, truth, they're all interconnected,"" Barry said. Teichner asked, ""Was the result the same then and now?""""Well, clearly people who might otherwise have been alive, died in 1918,"" he replied. ""And clearly this time around, people didn't believe the truth when they were told the truth. The misinformation, the active attacks on vaccines, there's no question it's killed people.""Martha Lincoln, a medical anthropologist at San Francisco State University, sees 1918 amnesia happening again. ""We're already forgetting, even before the pandemic is over. We're already forgetting the pandemic. I foresee, at best, a long struggle about whether we will remember, really, at all, and if we remember, what that memory will be.""For example, our entertainment, Lincoln said, is like some parallel universe where COVID is invisible, or long gone. Not everyone is choosing to forget. In Barre, Vt, the self-proclaimed granite center of the world, the monument business is booming. ""We're up 25-30% depending on product lines; I think all domestic manufacturers are up,"" said Rob Boulanger, who manages the huge Rock of Ages plant. ""People are pre-buying, so people are looking at their mortality, right? And wanting to take care of those final arrangements before something happens.""Teichner asked, ""Has COVID influenced that?""""Oh, absolutely.""The longing to remember – and be remembered – a catalyst. ""I think that if we don't manage to properly memorialize those that have been lost in this pandemic, it says that people like my dad, his life, didn't matter,"" said Kristin Urquiza. She never got to say goodbye to her father, Mark Urquiza, who died on June 30, 2020, isolated, on a ventilator, in an Arizona hospital. It was pre-vaccine. Cases were rising, but Arizona had opened back up.""Sure, maybe he should have said no to coming together with his friends to celebrate the 'end' of the pandemic,"" Urquiza said. ""He was given false information upon which he made choices, and that cost him his life.""Urquiza founded a non-profit, Marked by COVID, advocating for permanent memorials and a CVOD Memorial Day. In Congress there's been limited support. She said, ""Our elected officials would much rather move on, and I'm here to say we're not going to let you.""Barry said, ""I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't really many memorials.""""But a million dead? Are they invisible?"" Teichner asked. ""Well, which party is gonna take credit for that, you know?"" he laughed. ""There's been an effort to create a COVID commission, like the 9/11 commission, which, unfortunately, nobody seems eager to accept.""For Barry, the 1918 flu should be justification enough – proof of the cost in human lives of forgetting. ""There will be another pandemic,"" he said. ""If we allow the lessons that could be learned from this not to be learned, then we are really fools.""       See also:      For more info:   Story produced by Dustin Stephens.

"Are there any moons that are made of gas? - Livescience.com
The planets in our solar system come in two forms: Some are rocky, and some are gaseous. But all of the moons in our solar system are rocky, even the ones that orbit gas giants. So why aren't some moons in the solar system made of gas? And are there gaseous moons anywhere in the universe?There are some very good reasons why no nearby moons are gaseous. And while we haven't found a gaseous moon beyond our solar system, it could be possible under the right conditions, said Jonathan Lunine, chair of the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University.Specifically, it would depend on the moon's mass, its surrounding temperature and the influence of tidal forces — that is, the gravitational pull of a nearby body, like its host planet. Related: To illustrate how these conditions might affect a gaseous moon, imagine that our own moon's rocky composition were replaced with pure hydrogen. Hydrogen gas is much less dense than rock, so right away, the moon would grow to about the size of Earth, Lunine said.In fact, the enormous size of gas giants like Jupiter is one reason they can exist. If they were too small, the force of gravity wouldn't be powerful enough to hold those light elements together. But size isn't the only factor at play; there's also temperature. ""Let's take the moon as it is — as a rock,"" Lunine told Live Science. ""And then let's put a hydrogen atmosphere around it. We know that hydrogen atmosphere is going to escape very quickly just due to thermal effects."" In other words, the warmth of the sun would cause the hydrogen to evaporate away.""And so what that would tell me is, an entirely hydrogen-composed Earth's moon at the distance of the Earth from the sun is not going to be stable,"" Lunine said. That's true even as far out as Pluto's orbit, he added.But even if our imaginary gas moon were the size of Earth and the surrounding temperature were very cold, its host planet would still probably rip it apart. ""Remember that the Earth's moon is subject to tidal forces from the Earth,"" Lunine said. ""So it's actually not a sphere. It's pulled out a bit, but it doesn't get torn apart because it has some material strength associated with it.""——Does the moon rotate?—That's not the case with the hypothetical gaseous moon. ""Because it's a gas and not a solid — even if it's very cold — if it's orbiting around something else, it's going to get tidally stripped and torn apart by tides,"" Lunine said.So how could a gaseous moon ever be possible? The moon-planet system would have to be either very distant and cold, or very big. ""If it's the size of our moon, anywhere in our solar system, it's not going to work right. Way out in the depths of interstellar space? There, it's a question mark,"" Lunine said. ""If you want to make something super big, like a Neptune around a Jupiter, then sure, you can do it.”In that case, the gravitational forces holding these huge bodies together would likely keep tidal forces from destroying the Neptune-size moon. ""That could be perfectly stable,"" Lunine said.Originally published on Live Science.Ashley Hamer is a contributing writer for Live Science who has written about everything from space and quantum physics to health and psychology.

A natural impact on the moon created this crater in 2013. It's about to get another. The impact took place on the far side of the moon out of view of any telescopes or spacecraft, but NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will be in a position to start taking photos of the impact site in mid-March.   Modeling software company AGI developed this animation of how the crash may have appeared from a point above the moon. Bill Gray, an amateur astronomer and software developer in Maine, first noticed the terminal trajectory. His software picked up the impact in an orbital model and Gray worked with observatories around the world to gather additional data and increase his confidence in the prediction. Gray believes he misidentified the booster as a Falcon 9 years ago. He and other researchers since confirmed it to be the Chinese rocket part instead. ""I am astounded that we can tell the difference between the two rocket body options -- SpaceX versus Chinese -- and confirm which one will impact the moon with the data we have,""  in a statement in February. ""The differences we see are primarily due to type of paint used by SpaceX and the Chinese.""So the rocket about to hit the Moon, it turns out, is not the one we thought it was. This (an honest mistake) just emphasizes the problem with lack of proper  tracking of these deep space objects. https://t.co/JXKpUmEC2XThe rocket crashed into the lunar surface in a crater named Hertzsprung that's a little larger than the state of Iowa. The location is remote enough that the impact doesn't pose any threat to the Apollo mission or other space program landing sites. ""(The) rocket impact will provide a fortuitous experiment that could reveal a lot about how natural collisions pummel and scour planetary surfaces,"" University of Colorado Boulder planetary scientist Paul Hayne wrote for The Conversation. ""A deeper understanding of impact physics will go a long way in helping researchers interpret the barren landscape of the Moon and also the effects impacts have on Earth and other planets.""Hayne expects the impact obliterated the rocket instantly, creating a white flash that could be visible if any spacecraft were in place with a vantage point. ""It will be the moon's newest archaeological site,"" . ""We'll learn something about the geology of the location from the color differences and distribution of the ejected material. It's an opportunity to learn more about the moon's mysterious far side.""Besides adding a new feature to the dark side of the moon, there's some concern it could also introduce tiny hitchhikers to our natural satellite. ""So I'm not bothered by one more crater being made on the moon,""  in The Conversation. ""It already has something like half a billion craters that are 10 meters or more in diameter. What we should worry about is contaminating the moon with living microbes, or molecules that could in the future be mistaken as evidence of former life on the moon.""The  last month raising its concern that not enough is being done to track space junk, as NASA and others hope to establish a permanent presence on the moon.""The upcoming lunar impact illustrates well the need for a comprehensive regulatory regime in space, not only for the economically crucial orbits around Earth but also applying to the moon,"" said Holger Krag, head of ESA's space safety program.This isn't the first time a spacecraft has slammed into the moon, although Gray thinks it might be the first time it's happening unintentionally. As recently as 2009,  in a search for water (it found some). ""In essence,"" Gray says, ""this is a 'free' Lcross.""  ",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/PbpCmgvOHgQuj-qmRDx7SdRHtus=/84x84/2011/10/17/73f135f8-8d74-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/headshots_Erick_Mack_140x100.jpg,"Russia has lost its power over NASA and in the space business: experts - New York Post
Russia continues to degrade its role in the space industry, alienating itself from international customers it has long supplied space resources to because President Vladimir Putin refused to back down from the attack on Ukraine.Since Russia began its invasion last week, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin refused to launch a UK-satellite company’s payloads and stopped supplying Russian-built rocket engines to US customers and threatened to cut ties with its International Space Station partners, including NASA.The most delicate ongoing space policy issue is the For over 20 years, NASA and Russia worked together to build and maintain the orbiting laboratory 200 miles above Earth. The first modules were American and Russian. The first two astronauts to enter the space station when the lights were turned on were an American and Russian cosmonaut together, an intentional choice by STS-88 mission Commander Robert Cabana.When the space shuttle program ended, the US lost its ride to space for American astronauts. It began purchasing seats on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft for more than $80 million for nine years until SpaceX began launching astronauts under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program.Since Elon Musk’s company began launching Americans from Florida in May 2020, NASA had purchased fewer seats from Russia and was negotiating for a cosmonaut to launch on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon when the Ukraine invasion began.Rogozin has threatened to pull out of the ISS altogether and ended on-orbit science activities between cosmonauts and their international astronaut counterparts.University of Central Florida space policy expert Roger Handberg said Russia has lost its upper hand.“They’re not getting money because a good part of their space program had been selling seats on Soyuz missions to the United States,” Handberg said. “The Russians have lost their leverage, as you say, over the United States because they provided the access. Now we have independent access.”In April, NASA Astronauts Mark Vande Hei is set to undock from the space station with two cosmonauts and return to Earth on a Russian spacecraft landing in Kazakhstan. He may be the last American to fly on a Russian vehicle if the relationship deteriorates.Secondly, the US, Europe and Japan are working to extend the life of the ISS until 2030, but Russia has only committed to 2024, and those negotiations were also underway.If Russia drops out by 2030, that’s where things get complicated.“Does that mean we have to disassemble and take their modules off? That’s the kind of complicated question. We’re not there yet,” Handberg said.Since the end of the shuttle program, the ISS has depended on Russian spacecraft to lift the space station and move it in debris avoidance maneuvers. However, the Northrop Grumman cargo spaceship Cygnus might be capable of taking on that job. A recently docked Cygnus at the ISS will conduct the first US reboost test while in orbit, potentially providing an alternative option.If Russia chooses to take immediate action and sever ties with its International Space Station partners, it’s unclear how that would work. The ISS was not designed to be divided.“Many things are intertwined. So are we no longer allowed to use the Russian modules on this space station? Or vice versa, we don’t allow them to use our modules,” Handberg said. “In the confined circumstances they’re in, that gets pretty bizarre.”Handberg believes Russia is locked into the ISS until 2024, but there is always uncertainty with Putin.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/fox-news-logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=144&h=96&crop=1,"T.

Rex,” might need to be re-categorized into three distinct species, according to researchers. The Tyrannosaurus rex is the only recognized species of the group of dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus to date – though previous research has reportedly acknowledged variation across Tyrannosaurs skeletal remains. In a controversial new study published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Evolutionary Biology, South Carolina and Maryland paleontologists conducted an analysis of skeletal remains they said reveal physical differences in the femur and other bones and dental structures.Based on a dataset of 37 specimens, the group looked at the robustness in the femur of 24 specimens and measured the diameter of the base of teeth or space in the gums to assess if specimens had one or two slender teeth resembling incisors. According to an accompanying release, the scientists observed that the femur varied across specimens, with two times more robust femurs than svelte ones across specimens. Robust femurs were also found in some juvenile specimens and “gracile” femurs were found in some that were full adult size, suggesting that variation is not related to growth. Dental structure also varied and those with one incisorform tooth were correlated with often having higher femur gracility.They explained the Tyrannosaurus specimens “exhibit such a remarkable degree of proportional variations, distributed at different stratigraphic levels, that the pattern favors multiple species at least partly separated by time; ontogenetic and sexual causes being less consistent with the data.”“Variation in dentary incisiform counts correlate with skeletal robusticity and also appear to change over time,” the authors noted. 28 specimens could be identified in distinct layers of sediment at the Lancian upper Maastrichtian formations in North America – which was estimated to be from between 67.5 to 66 million years ago – and the paleontologists compared Tyrannosaurus specimens with other theropod species found in lower layers of sediment.Only robust Tyrannosaurus femurs were found in the lower layer of sediment – and variation was not different to that of other theropod species – which the release said indicates that just one species of Tyrannosaurus likely existed at this point. However, the variation in Tyrannosaurus femur robustness in the top layer of the sediments was higher, suggesting the specimens had physically developed into more distinct forms and other dinosaur species. “We found that the changes in Tyrannosaurus femurs are likely not related to the sex or age of the specimen,” lead author Gregory Paul said in a statement. “We propose that the changes in the femur may have evolved over time from a common ancestor who displayed more robust femurs to become more gracile in later species. The differences in femur robustness across layers of sediment may be considered distinct enough that the specimens could potentially be considered separate species.”Based on that evidence, the researchers said three morphotypes – what Science Direct defines as any of a group of different types of individuals of the same species in a population – and two additional species of Tyrannosaurus were “diagnosed” and named. “One robust species with two small incisors in each dentary appears to have been present initially, followed by two contemporaneous species (one robust and another gracile) both of which had one small incisor in each dentary, suggesting both anagenesis and cladogenesis occurred,” they continued. Evolution can take place by anagenesis, in which changes occur within a lineage. Whereas, in cladogenesis, a lineage splits into two or more separate lines.The authors nominated two potential species: “Tyrannosaurus imperator” and “Tyrannosaurus regina.”Tyrannosaurus imperator relates to specimens found at the lower and middle layers of sediment, with more robust femurs and usually two incisor teeth.Tyrannosaurus regina is linked to specimens from the upper and possibly middle layers of sediment, with slenderer femurs and one incisor tooth. The Tyrannosaurus rex was identified in the upper and possibly middle layer of sediment, with more robust femurs and only one incisor tooth. The authors acknowledged that they cannot rule out that variation is due to extreme individual differences, or atypical sexual dimorphism, rather than separate groups. They also cautioned that the location within sediment layers is not known for some specimens. Reaction to the study from scientists has been largely skeptical, with some claiming the paper does not have enough evidence to reach its conclusions – and raising concerns over some of the specimens included in the study to National Geographic.Paul told The New York Times on Feb. 28 that he knows his proposal is provocative. “I’m aware that there could be a lot of people who aren’t going to be happy about this,” he told the publication. “And, my response to them is: Publish a refutation.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/fox-news-logo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=144&h=96&crop=1,"NASA is offering people the chance to fly their name around the moon on its upcoming Artemis 1 mission - Yahoo News

"What to expect from Apple's 'Peek Performance' March event - The Verge
Apple is poised for its first livestream event of 2022 on Tuesday, March 8th at 1PM ET. The company sent out press invitation emails for the event titled “Peek Performance,” with  Apple will announce a new third-generation iPhone SE with 5G.The iPad Air might also get a new spec bump update at the event, with upgrades to both 5G and an A15 Bionic processor, similar to last year’s iPad Mini. Another rumor suggests an  alongside a redesigned MacBook Air might be coming. New Macs, including a Mac Mini with an M1 Pro / M1 Max processor update, could also get a showing, and new iMac and Mac Pro hardware are said to be in the works — but those will likely show up later in the year. Whatever the case might be, we might see at least one of these new Macs on March 8th.That’s not all Apple might announce on Tuesday, so prime your expectations for the Apple event by reading about all the rumors and details below.The upcoming third-generation iPhone SE is expected to succeed the 2020 model as the new budget-friendly iPhone option. The first iPhone SE came out in 2016 and remained available for four years, which means the SE line is set for a quicker change of pace.According to reliable analyst and leaker Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone SE 3 will probably include the latest A15 Bionic chip, 5G with millimeter wave, 64GB base storage with 128GB / 256GB options, and retain the design and colors of the current model. Kuo  on a verified account that has remained quiet until now.Some predictions for the coming new iPhone SE:1. Mass production in Mar'22.2. Estimated shipments of 25-30 mn units in 2022.3. Storage: 64/128/256GB.4. A15 & 5G support (mmW & Sub-6 GHz).5. Casing: white, black, and red.6. Similar form factor design to current SE.The 2020 iPhone SE offered shockingly good value with the then-latest chipset, but its battery life was never the star of the show. Now that US carriers only want phones with 5G on their shelves, the battery life in a new iPhone SE would be a bigger concern — especially if the form factor remains the same. The current iPhone SE body models the iPhone 8, but its aging design language dates all the way back to 2014 with the iPhone 6.It’s also possible that the iPhone SE could borrow the form factor of the iPhone 13 Mini. Due to reports of less than expected sales of the iPhone 12 Mini, it’s rumored that the iPhone 13 Mini might be Apple’s last compact mainline phone. But just as the iPhone SE from 2016 carried on the compact design of the iPhone 5s, and the 2020 iPhone SE copied the smaller iPhone 8 design, the iPhone SE might become the new home for the Mini.There’s no word on price yet, but don’t expect to see a reduction to the starting $399 price. 5G modems are still expensive, so a starting storage option of 64GB makes sense if the price is to remain intact. Touch ID would also keep costs down if the design remains.The iPad Air received an iPad Pro-style redesign in 2020: it got flat edges, thin bezels, Apple Pencil 2 support, USB-C, and a new Touch ID sleep / wake button. But the still fresh design is already lagging behind: the iPad Mini from last year followed the design of the iPad Air but one-upped it with with the latest A15 Bionic processor and 5G data options (though just sub-6GHz and no millimeter wave support).So it makes sense for Apple to roll out an updated iPad Air with the latest A15 Bionic processor and with a 5G option — and perhaps center stage as well. And although FaceID would welcome, don’t expect any other changes.It’s possible that Apple announces a new MacBook Air with a new M2 chip at this event. The current design of the MacBook Air dates back to 2018 and was a testbed for the Apple M1 chip debut in 2020.We reviewed the current MacBook Air with M1 as one of the best laptops you could buy in 2020, with a score that was cut short of perfect only because of the less-than-stellar webcam.But it’s 2022 now, and we have freshly updated MacBook Pro designs with better screens and a better camera that you can expect the MacBook Air will soon follow. It might even come with a notch.A new Mac Mini was , but it never showed up. Right now, the only way to harness the power of the latest M1 Pro and M1 Max chips is in the latest MacBook Pro models. A new Mac Mini with the latest processor options would change that.The current Mac Mini design dates back to 2010, which was made to be just large enough to fit an optical drive. So it’s about time we get a new Mac Mini chassis, but if we don’t, then hopefully, we will at least get a “Pro” looking space gray finish again. We could even see Mac Mini split up into a pro option and a standard option that comes with a new M2 processor.Right now, there’s only one iMac option with M1 processors, but it only has a 24-inch screen option. If we don’t see new larger iMacs on Tuesday, we might see it later in the year. The iMac Pro was also discontinued a year ago, so that would make for an interesting surprise, though there haven’t been any supply chain leaks that would indicate a new version is imminent. There’s also the Mac Pro that has no M1 option yet — and while it’s rumored to be in the works, don’t hold your breath for that one on Tuesday.The last time Apple held an event in March was in 2019, a live presentation that showcased new premium Apple services like Apple TV Plus. Three years later, it’s very possible Apple could showcase new TV shows or movies like it did last September.Some speculation of the meaning of Apple’s event invite title “Peek Performance” points to the word “Peek” as the name of a VR / AR product. While Apple’s long-rumored headset product is , perhaps there’s a chance Apple can surprise and delight — just don’t expect to see an Apple Car anytime soon.Apple is also expected to release some software updates: iOS 15.4 that can let your Face ID-enabled iPhone  and also a macOS Monterey plus iPad OS 15.4 update that will finally enable the iPad to Mac traversing Universal Control feature.Check out all the latest Apple news as it breaks here on The Verge.Please confirm your subscription to Verge Deals via the verification email we just sent you.",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hdOrD2V50xZHae3K5CDsbVG2uY=/0x0:1198x728/1200x800/filters:focal(504x269:694x459)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70585589/Screen_Shot_2022_03_02_at_12.03.10_PM.0.jpg,"Halo Infinite’s campaign co-op won’t arrive with season two in May - The Verge
Halo Infinite’s second season won’t ship with online campaign co-op when it launches on May 3rd, 343 Industries announced.

It’s unclear whether split-screen and online campaign co-op will release simultaneously, though, as Staten only mentions network co-op as slated for release during season 2.“It’s going to take more time to land a high-quality, full-featured 4-player network co-op experience in the massive, wide-open world of Halo Infinite,” Staten explains in the post. “We’re also committed to a great 2-player split-screen co-op experience on all Xbox consoles, from the original Xbox One through Xbox Series X — the non-linear, wide-open sections of the Campaign present some big challenges for split-screen that have taken us more time to solve.”Staten also provides an update on Forge, which is still on track for a season three release. A small group of players is currently testing out the level editor, Staten says, with public flights planned for “later this year.” At launch, season two will bring new arena and Big Team Battle maps called Catalyst and Breaker, respectively.

If you’re not excited about Apple’s upcoming Peek Performance keynote, you’re not the only one. According to most reports, the company will announce new iPhone SE and iPad Air models at the event. It’s not the most exciting stuff. But according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple could have a surprise up its sleeve that would make Tuesday considerably more interesting. In his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman writes he “wouldn’t rule out” Apple previewing a next-generation display at the event.Predictions for Apple's new desktop products:1. 2022: More powerful Mac mini and more affordable external display (27-inch without mini-LED).2. 2023: Mac Pro and iMac Pro.He reports the company completed development on a new monitor “months ago,” and had originally planned to release it “soon after” the launch of last year’s MacBook Pro. Given there have been reports suggesting Apple will announce a new high-end Mac mini at the event, a matching display doesn’t sound out of the realm of possibility. To that point, Apple has reportedly been working on two new monitors for the past few years. A report from 9to5Mac published earlier in the week shed light on a possible 7K successor to the Pro Display XDR that will feature an A13 processor to offload some processing tasks. The monitor Gurman references would appear to be a more affordable model that would succeed the company’s long discontinued Thunderbolt Display.",https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ouKkXPzWkbSjR1J5UN6Smg--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQ1NDt3PTY3NTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc271e90-350a-11ec-ab7c-6d5adf8edae1.cf.jpg,"How to avoid or remove the red square health debuff in 'Elden Ring' - NME

    Russian officials are looking to recruit Syrian soldiers to fight in Ukraine as battles are set to intensity in and around major cities, . U.S. officials told the Journal that Moscow is specifically recruiting Syrian fighters for their expertise in urban combat fighting.Troops loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is backed by Russia, have been fighting a fierce battle in urban centers for nearly a decade, giving them a skill set hard to find among Russian troops. The involvement of Syrian troops would further internationalize a war that began with Russia's invasion on February 24. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that over 16,000 foreign fighters have volunteered to defend the country, calling it an “international legion."" Russia's war on its neighbor has led to a series of international sanctions being leveled against Moscow, however the U.S. and its NATO allies have shown no interest in direct engagement in the war. The U.S. has contributed more than $1 billion to help Ukraine’s military over the past year and has pledged more aid as Russia’s weeklong war against the country continues.The UN’s refugee agency said on Thursday that more than one million Ukrainian citizens have fled the country since the invasion. The Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are  1998 - 2022  Nexstar Media Inc. | All Rights Reserved.
