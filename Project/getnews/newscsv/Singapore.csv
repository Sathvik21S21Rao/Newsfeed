Harry Kane scored four times to close in on Wayne Rooney‚Äôs England scoring record as the Three Lions hammered San Marino 10-0 to book their place at next year‚Äôs World Cup in Qatar.Emile Smith Rowe and Tyrone Mings both scored their first international goals but Kane was once again the star of the show, adding to his hat-trick in Friday‚Äôs win over Albania to take his England tally to 48, five short of Rooney‚Äôs record.Harry Maguire was also on the scoresheet for the second game in a row, heading home to open the scoring inside six minutes to set England on their way to their biggest victory since 1964 on a night when they had needed only a point to secure qualification for Qatar as group winners.Bukayo Saka‚Äôs low cross was then turned past his own goalkeeper Filippo Fabbri to double the England lead before Kane took centre stage, lifting a penalty straight down the middle after Phil Foden‚Äôs bicycle-kick had been handled on its way wide.The skipper would soon convert another spot-kick to complete his hat-trick, having already scuffed Smith Rowe‚Äôs cross into the far corner for a second, and then fired low past Elia Benedettini to add his fourth and England‚Äôs fifth before half-time.Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale had been handed his England debut and barely had a save to make, but Arsenal teammate Smith Rowe, making his first start after debuting as a substitute against Albania, was heavily involved and got off the mark at this level with a sweeping finish after a good late run from midfield.Mings was next to find the net, heading home from Trent Alexander-Arnold‚Äôs free-kick, as the full-back racked up a quick-fire trio of assists, also teeing up substitute Tammy Abraham and Saka, who took England into double figures 11 minutes from time.Read More",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/smHPm5Mt9gut3RwY2lfqXA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/X1XOnGXCbIuIpK5Q.4FLhA--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/60ac40a3cb28e493bd32a01413e0e2f6,"Scotland 2-0 Denmark: Scots win to secure home draw in World Cup qualifying playoff - Football365

In a wonderful break, Armstrong sent Adams racing clear and this time he slotted past Schmeichel to make it 2-0 ‚Äì to the delight of most inside Hampden.Full-back Tony Ralston came on for Kieran Tierney to make his debut before Scotland almost made it 3-0, with Kjaer blocking a goalbound shot from Armstrong.However, the two goals were more than enough on a memorable night as the quest to reach Qatar goes on for Clarke and his team.¬†",https://d2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/11/15214348/scotland.jpg,"Brazilian Grand Prix: F1 driver ratings as Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen battle in Sao Paulo thriller - The Independent

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will seek particular pieces of advice from new Aston Villa boss Steven Gerrard to improve his own team, according to one pundit.The Premier League has enjoyed several standout arrivals in its dugouts since Klopp took charge of the Reds in 2015. Indeed, Pep Guardiola has led Manchester City impressively, while Thomas Tuchel has developed Chelsea.Antonio Conte is also back in the English top flight and while Gerrard may not have won the same number of titles as those managers, he remains a standout name.He won the Scottish Premiership with Rangers last season but now wants to try his luck as  after starring for Liverpool as a player.Gerrard travels to Anfield with his Villa side in December, which will prove a historic moment. However, former Premier League striker Kevin Phillips believes that Klopp will speak more often to his managerial counterpart.Indeed, he claimed that the Liverpool boss will seek advice about his midfield as he looks to improve his team.‚ÄúI would imagine they are friends,‚Äù .‚ÄúThey will not discuss each other‚Äôs tactics and team selection when they play each other but I cannot see why they wouldn‚Äôt otherwise.‚ÄúEveryone is out there to achieve.

SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - Keppel Corporation on Tuesday (Nov 16) reiterated that its offer for Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) is ""firm and irrevocable"" and also provides the shortest time to payout by mid-January next year for SPH shareholders.Keppel's statement comes one day after the consortium comprising Hotel Properties (HPL), businessman Ong Beng Seng¬†and two Temasek-linked entities, CLA and Mapletree, raised its offer for SPH.

The RM 035 Rafael Nadal watch. (Photo: Richardmille.com)SINGAPORE: A sales assistant at a Richard Mille watch shop at Marina Bay Sands pocketed S$175,000 in cash that was meant to purchase a luxury timepiece for a customer.Bobby Koh Kah Choong, 41, was sentenced to eight months' jail on Tuesday (Nov 16). He pleaded guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust by dishonest misappropriation.The court heard that Koh worked as a sales assistant at the Richard Mille store at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. He was tasked with selling the brand's luxury watches to customers, as well as to source for and order watches from suppliers.Sometime in November 2015, the victim, a 52-year-old Malaysian man, contacted Koh to buy an RM035 R¬†Nadal watch.Koh told the victim that the watch was priced at S$175,000, and that the store would accept only cash payment.As the victim was staying in Malaysia, he arranged for an acquaintance to make cash payment for the watch at the store.¬†The victim's acquaintance paid S$175,000 in cash to Koh at the store that same month. Koh was to use the money to pay the watch supplier.Koh later sent the victim a receipt via WhatsApp as evidence that he had received the money. However, Koh did not record the transaction in his company records, which was the standard procedure.He omitted this as he initially intended to find a private dealer to buy the watch for a lower price and earn a profit for himself.However, Koh later decided to misappropriate the money instead, to pay off his father's debts. He handed the entire sum to his father so he could settle his debts.In mid-2017, Koh resigned from the company. For more than two years from November 2015 to 2018, the victim asked Koh repeatedly about the watch.Koh would lie to the victim that he had ordered the watch¬†but it had yet to arrive. He did so to buy time to recoup the money he had misappropriated and evade detection of his offence.More than four years after ordering the watch from Koh, the victim contacted the chief operations officer (COO) of the Richard Mille store in question to tell him what happened.He showed him a copy of the receipt Koh had given him, and the COO told the victim that there was no record of the transaction by the company. The COO later lodged a police report against Koh.In March this year, Koh made full restitution of S$175,000 to the victim.The prosecutor asked for eight months' jail, noting that there was an element of abuse of trust in the case. The offence also went undetected for a significant period of time, coming to light only in December 2019, she said.Defence lawyer Amarick Gill asked for six months' jail instead. After the sentence was passed, he asked if his client could defer his sentence, as Koh would like to attend his son's primary school graduation and to be present when his son's Primary School Leaving Examination results are released.The judge allowed Koh to begin his jail term on Dec 7.For criminal breach of trust by dishonest appropriation, he could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

"Third dose of Pfizer vaccine 'really lifts the level of immunity', immunologist says - RNZ
An immunologist says those who qualify should get a Covid-19 booster shot because it seems that the third dose of Pfizer really lifts people's level of immunity.The government yesterday announced that  would be available in a fortnight from 29 November for people who got their second dose more than six months ago.Ultimately the booster shots will be available to everyone, though those initially seeking a third shot will be the over-65s, border workers and medical staff - the first cohort to be vaccinated earlier this year.Immunologist Graham Le Gros, who is director at the Malaghan Institute of Medical Research, said booster shots had great potential to change the game for the better.""It seems that with this Pfizer vaccine, the third dose really lifts the level of immunity way beyond and it really gives the person who receives it a very strong immune response, very protective and it really resists against that waning immunity we've seen from overseas.""He said some people, such as those on immune suppressive drugs or those who are older, may not have had such a good immune response to two shots of the vaccine and the third dose would bring their immune response up to a good level so they stay protected.Le Gros said there was some speculation about how long the booster shot would last, but he was hopeful that it would give a couple of years of ""durable immunity"" because of the way that the immune system works.""You change the cells of the immune system when you give that booster shot and actually these memory cells which long live, they go around different parts of your body and they stay there just waiting, waiting for the virus to come and actually that's the strength to the long-term immunity and it seems as though the booster shot will give those.""It was known from other vaccines that once those cells have been produced, they last for a long time, he said.The Pfizer booster shot seemed to cover the existing variants of Covid-19 and it was also possible to mix the Pfizer booster shot with another type of vaccine, such as AstraZeneca, he said.""So we're in a very good place for the booster shot and remember, think of winter next year, next year we're going to go into a situation where influenza could be around, Covid-19 will certainly be around as we go back indoors, so having a booster shot from now until autumn next year probably very good for people.""He said a clinical trial was underway in the UK comparing the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines which would inform future decisions on what was a good combination of vaccines for the future.""So remember this Covid-19 is going to be around for years to come, so we're going to have to work out which strategies to give booster shots and long durable immunity.""I'm afraid it's bad news for everyone and they all go depressed but the virus is here and we've got to work with it and get rid of it.""Work was underway to make a New Zealand made booster shot, Le Gros said.""Right now for New Zealand if you really want to increase your immunity, if you've actually been a bit immune-suppressed or you're over 65 where you've got a kind of hard old immune system, a booster shot is a very good thing to do to make sure that you're protected.""He said those who had their two shots over six months ago needed to ensure they achieved strong immunity by getting a booster shot.Booster shots of the Pfizer vaccine will be available in a fortnight for people who got their second dose more than six months prior, the government has announced.Australia's Covid-19 booster vaccination program begins today, meaning anyone over 18 who received their second dose at least six months ago - 8 May - can book to have a third shot.A New Zealand-based company has developed a two-minute test which can tell how protected someone is from Covid-19.

A woman in Argentina has been identified as the second person ever whose own immune system may have cured her of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).The 30-year-old woman was first diagnosed with HIV-1, the most common type of HIV, in 2013.After eight years of multiple follow up checks, however, there appears to be no sign of active viral infection in her body, according to a study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine journal on Monday.The woman, who has not been identified over concerns related to the stigma that arises from the disease, has been called the ‚ÄúEsperanza patient‚Äù by researchers.This is because the discovery has brought hope for 38 million people suffering from HIV across the globe for a possible ‚Äústerilising cure,‚Äù an extremely rare cure that is attained through natural immunity.The Spanish word ‚ÄúEsperanza‚Äù means hope in English.The woman is an ‚Äúelite controller,‚Äù a term used by researchers to identify those rare HIV-positive subjects who have been living without taking Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), which is the treatment for HIV. The woman has been living without ART for the past eight years.Researchers in Argentina and the US made this observation as they had been collecting blood samples from her since 2017 for signs of the dormant virus, said the study, which pointed out that the scientists did not find intact HIV genomes after testing over 1.19 billion blood and 500 million tissue cells.‚ÄúGenome-intact and replication-competent HIV-1 were not detected in an elite controller despite analysis of massive numbers of cells from blood and tissues, suggesting that this patient may have naturally achieved a sterilising cure of HIV-1 infection,‚Äù the study stated.Antiretrovirals are administered to suppress HIV replication. However, at times, the virus inserts its genetic blueprints into chromosomes and establishes a latent reservoir that is often invisible to the immune system.Such inactive forms of HIV are known as HIV proviruses.

By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO (Reuters) - The Delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus now accounts for nearly all of the coronavirus infections globally, fueled by unchecked spread of the novel coronavirus in many parts of the world. So far, vaccines are still able to defend against serious disease and death from Delta, but scientists remain on alert.Here is what we know:DELTA - STILL DOMINANTThe Delta variant, first detected in India in December 2020, remains the most worrisome version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.The World Health Organization classifies Delta as a variant of concern, a category that means the variant is capable of increasing transmissibility, causing more severe disease or reducing the benefit of vaccines and treatments.Delta's ""superpower"" is its transmissibility, according to Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego.Delta is more than two times as contagious as previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Studies suggest it may be more likely to put infected people in the hospital than prior forms of the virus.Delta also can cause symptoms two to three days sooner than the original coronavirus, giving the immune system less time to mount a defense.People infected with Delta carry around 1,200 times more virus in their noses compared with the original version of the coronavirus. The amount of virus in vaccinated individuals who become infected with Delta is on par with those who are unvaccinated, and both can transmit the virus to others.In vaccinated people, however, the amount of virus drops more quickly, so they likely spread the virus for a shorter time.According to the WHO, Delta makes up 99.5% of all genomic sequences reported to public databases and has ""outcompeted"" other variants in most countries.A key exception is South America, where Delta has spread more gradually, and other variants previously seen as possible global threats - notably Gamma, Lambda and Mu - still contribute to a significant proportion of reported cases.DELTA OFFSPRINGGiven Delta's global dominance, many vaccine experts now believe that all future variants will be offshoots of Delta.One notable Delta ""grandchild"" is known as AY.4.2 and is concentrated largely in the UK, where it makes up roughly 10% of sequenced virus samples.AY.4.2 carries two additional mutations in the spike protein, which the virus uses to enter cells. Scientists are still studying what advantage, if any, these mutations confer.The UK Health Security Agency has designated the AY.4.2 a ""Variant Under Investigation."" A preliminary analysis suggests it does not significantly impair vaccine effectiveness compared with Delta, but there is some evidence that it could be slightly more transmissible, the agency said.According to the WHO, AY.4.2 has spread to at least 42 countries, including the United States.MORE ON THE WAY?Virus experts are closely watching the evolution of Delta, looking for any sign that it has acquired mutations that would allow the highly transmissible variant to pierce the immune protection of vaccines and natural infection.Even so, while current vaccines prevent severe disease and death, they do not block infection. The virus is still capable of replicating in the nose, even among vaccinated people, who can then transmit the disease through tiny, aerosolized droplets.To defeat SARS-CoV-2 will likely require a new generation of vaccines that also block transmission, according to Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine developer at the Mayo Clinic. Until then, Poland and other experts say, the world remains vulnerable.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Dan Grebler)",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/H_Qmh5IXrLY78hXedtjl1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU5Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RVo0PwMtj6BbkQWLOZiwxA--~B/aD00OTc7dz04MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/8af7de17e9a9fffc52c1d2aa3fd42152,"Vaccines not linked to menstrual changes; COVID-19, flu shots can go together - CNA
The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.Many women have reported noticing changes in their menstrual cycle after being vaccinated against COVID-19 but a new study of 1,273 women in the UK found no correlation, according to a report posted on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The women in the study kept careful records of their cycles and their vaccination dates.""We were unable to detect strong signals to support the idea"" that COVID-19 vaccines are linked to changes in timing or flow of women's periods, said Victoria Male from Imperial College London. It is possible that larger studies, or studies in other countries, might find links, she said.""It is important to note that most people who report such a change following vaccination find that their period returns to normal the following cycle."" Other studies have found no evidence that the vaccines affect female fertility, Male added.It is safe to administer COVID-19 vaccines and flu vaccines to patients at the same time, and doing so might increase vaccination rates, according to a report published on Thursday in The Lancet.Researchers randomly assigned 697 adult volunteers to receive their second dose of either the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or the viral-vector vaccine from AstraZeneca/Oxford, along with one of three influenza vaccines for the 2020-2021 season (FluAd or Flucelvax from Seqirus UK or Flublok from Sanofi) or a placebo.Most reactions to the shots were mild or moderate, and antibody responses to the vaccines were not adversely affected by getting two shots at once, the study found.Giving both vaccines at a single appointment ""should reduce the burden on health-care services for vaccine delivery, allowing for timely vaccine administration and protection from COVID-19 and influenza for those in need,"" the research team concluded.Lung cancer patients may get good protection from mRNA COVID-19 vaccines even while undergoing treatments that suppress the immune system, a small study suggests.From January through July this year, researchers in France administered the vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech to 306 lung cancer patients, 70 per cent of whom had recently received immunosuppressive therapies that impair the body's ability to respond to vaccines.Patients with COVID-19 antibodies from a previous infection received only one dose; most patients, however, received both doses, according to a paper released on Monday and scheduled for publication in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology.About 10 per cent of the patients failed to develop antibodies in response to the first two doses and received a third dose, which successfully induced antibodies in all but three individuals who also had blood disorders known to impair the effect of the vaccines.The researchers noted that before vaccines, the death rate among lung cancer patients who developed COVID-19 was 30 per cent.In this seven-month study, only eight patients, or 2.6 per cent of the total, developed mild cases of COVID-19. Because the study was small and not randomised, the investigators called for more research to confirm their findings.¬†We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

SINGAPORE, Nov. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baxter Asia Pacific (Baxter), a global leader in dialysis care, announced today the launch of My Kidney Journey, a comprehensive online portal to support patients living with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is on the rise in APAC and continues to be a major public health problem. It is often referred to as a 'silent killer' as patients present no symptoms until they reach an advanced stage of the disease, and is becoming more prevalent in countries across Asia. In Singapore, for example, the prevalence of CKD is projected to increase to 24.3% by 2035 due to demographic shifts and the rising incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes and hypertension.My Kidney Journey¬†has been developed to provide additional information on CKD such as the symptoms, causes and stages, as well as balanced and up-to-date information on multiple treatment options to manage CKD such as Home Haemodialysis (Home HD), Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) at home, in-centre dialysis care and kidney transplant. It also offers support to patients, families and caregivers by providing insights on ways to live well on dialysis, including coping with the emotional difficulties of a diagnosis and demands of treatment.""Baxter is committed to improving the care and quality of life for patients with CKD through our continued innovation in modern PD (Peritoneal Dialysis), In-Centre HD (Haemodialysis), along with Home HD (Home Haemodialysis) and other home-base renal replacement therapies and services, which have proven to be advantageous especially during the pandemic,"" said Andrew Frye, President of Baxter Asia Pacific.The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted people with chronic illnesses. Those with pre-existing conditions, including CKD, are at greater risk of more serious illness with COVID-19 because of their immunocompromised status. Home dialysis offers an opportunity for CKD patients to manage their condition from the comfort of their homes, while reducing direct human interactions from hospital visits, as well as the likelihood of infection. New data from Baxter highlights that remote patient management digital health supports HCPs to improve clinical outcomes, including monitoring their patients' home dialysis treatments, and remotely adjusting therapy without the need for patients to make visits to the clinic or hospital.""There is no one-size fits all model for managing Chronic Kidney Disease¬†(CKD). However, we hope that My Kidney Journey will provide patients with the knowledge and resources they need to plan for a healthy and full life while on dialysis or other CKD treatments. Aside from patients, we hope that this new online portal can be a platform that offers support to caregivers who are supporting their loved ones to adjust to life with CKD and their own personal journey,"" Frye added.Associate Professor Marjorie Foo, Senior Consultant, Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital said: ""When kidney failure is advancing and replacement therapy is imminent, this can often cause distress and anxiety. It is normal for patients and their carers to worry about what the future holds and how life will change. Relevant sources of information, whether online or through support groups, will empower patients to navigate the complex kidney replacement landscape. Access to information and support, alongside meaningful shared-decision making consultations with their nephrology team is key to supporting patients on their dialysis journey.""My Kidney Journey APAC is now available to patients and the general public in 10 countries and 9 different languages across APAC. For more, visit .About BaxterEvery day, millions of patients and caregivers rely on Baxter's leading portfolio of critical care, nutrition, renal, hospital and surgical products.

"Rebecca Lim is engaged; Ian Fang seems quite unhappy about it - Yahoo Singapore News
SINGAPORE ‚Äî Actress Rebecca Lim is engaged ‚Äì she announced it on Instagram last night with photos of her boyfriend's proposal to her.According to 8days, Lim's fianc√© isn't a celebrity, is 35 years old like her, and works in corporate branding.The actress did not disclose his identity, posting only photos which did not reveal his face, saying that he preferred to maintain his privacy.The photos show a silver and white themed proposal event, complete with a lot of balloons and the words ""Marry Me"" in huge letters. The engagement took place at an art gallery that belonged to a friend of the anonymous guy.¬†Lim said the proposal actually took place last Friday (12 Nov). She had met him only early this year ‚Äì yup, the engagement comes after less than a year of dating. She was introduced to him by a family friend at a friend's dinner gathering.Lim told 8days, ""I think when you meet at a certain age and you‚Äôve been through things, you know what you want and what you don‚Äôt want. I was very transparent from the beginning and so was he. And we laid our cards down at the beginning. We got to know each other at this age where we want to be honest as possible, and not to waste any more time (laughs).""Ian Fang isn't happyAmid the congrats and celebrations over Lim's engagement, Channel 8 actor Ian Fang didn't seem too happy, however.¬†Fang and Lim had long been rumoured to be dating, but back in 2019, between Fang and actress Carrie Wong were leaked.After the scandalous news broke at that time, Lim curiously ¬†Lim and Fang had always dodged questions about a romantic relationship between them and had never confirmed they were dating.On the same day that Lim announced her engagement, Fang wrote a cryptic, emo-sounding post that he later deleted.¬†Referring to Fann Wong and Christopher Lee, the golden celebrity couple of local showbiz, Fang wrote in Chinese: ""A cloud passes by like smoke and vanishes silently, without any colours of the clouds.

Although everyone thinks that you might be like them, not everyone thinks you will be the next Christopher Lee and Fann Wong too.""Fang also seemed to respond to criticism from netizens who dredged up his alleged cheating on Lim.¬†In an Instagram Story which he also later deleted, he wrote in Chinese: ""Why am I being scolded when someone else is getting married?

What does the Michelin-starred chef like to eat on his day off? Just peek at the menu at Claudine, which is named in honour of his mum, when it opens on Nov 16.Claudine 'Bouillabaisse' featuring John Dory, razor clams, mussels, scallops and carabinero prawn heads with fennel and potato in a robust fish stew. (Photo: Claudine)Chef Julien Royer must have had his ear talked off about how lovely but rare a treat dining at three-Michelin-starred Odette is. We surmise this because we personally have done this ourselves at some point.Well, now he can tell people like us, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs Claudine‚Äù.His third restaurant (after three-Michelin-starred Odette and one-starred Louise in Hong Kong) opens on Tuesday (Nov 16) in the Dempsey area, and if enjoying champagne and oysters in an erstwhile chapel sounds like your idea of a gastronomic good time, then you‚Äôve come to the right place. ¬†Claudine takes over the space of The White Rabbit, located in a former military chapel built in the 1930s. Like Odette, the restaurant is opened in partnership with The Lo & Behold Group, under which the now-defunct White Rabbit also sheltered.The beautiful heritage building has been given a cosmetic refresh, as well as a layout redesign¬†‚Äì a large, bright open kitchen now occupies one end, while the bar sits at the opposite end under a carefully preserved stained-glass window.The chapel‚Äôs original elements, like its wrought-iron window grilles, are balanced out by bold design touches such as a deep red ceiling and a 15m-long decorative light snaking across the dining room, as well as mirrored lamps reminiscent of traditional French bistros and striking panels of pressed grasses.
¬†On the menu are luxed-up French classics like steak tartare, vol-au-vent, pepper steak and a show-stopping 'bouillabaisse'; and playful desserts like a new spin on the traditional ile flottante or floating island, and the ‚ÄúPariterole‚Äù, a hybrid of the Paris-Brest and the profiterole.‚ÄúMany dishes are inspired by what I like to eat when I go out. We‚Äôll have some very French classics like steak au poivre and creme caramel. This is stuff I really enjoy finding on the menu. You‚Äôll have a sense of locality and Southeast Asian influence on the menu as well, because I believe a sense of place in any restaurant is very important.‚ÄùAsian influences in the cuisine come, for example, in the form of a dumpling dish with Mozambique langoustine and sugar snap peas; and also in more subtle ways such as Royer deciding to include prawn heads in the 'bouillabaisse' because he‚Äôs come to enjoy their flavour as locals do.The restaurant's kitchen is overseen by executive chef Julien Mercier, a longtime friend of Royer‚Äôs; the two once worked together closely and Royer was insistent that Mercier was the right person for the job.The idea for Claudine was born two and a half years ago, Royer told us. ‚ÄúI always thought there was a gap in the market in Singapore,‚Äù he said.Between your everyday bistro brasserie and your very high-end French dining destination, there was nothing in between. ‚ÄúThe idea was to fill that gap in between, for people who like really high quality cooking, great ingredients and products, a Michelin-star level of cooking and precision, but at the same time don't want to spend three, four or more hours at the table.‚ÄùClaudine, in fact, is the kind of place Royer himself envisions spending time at after a game of tennis on his day off.‚ÄúMaybe this is a bit selfish, but I personally love to go out and eat in a place like this on my day off. And I will!‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúClaudine will be an everyday restaurant of joie de vivre, and most importantly, a neighbourhood French restaurant. You can come here and have a glass of wine and eat something at the bar, you can come with your family on the weekend for brunch, you can come for a business dinner in the middle of the week.‚ÄùOdette, Louise, Claudine¬†‚Äì how does he keep track of all the female energy in his life?‚ÄúIt's very easy because they are the ones who are very close to my heart and shaped me as a chef and as a man,‚Äù he said with a laugh. While Odette and Louise are restaurants named after his grandmothers, ‚ÄúClaudine is the name of my mum. So, this is coming from deep inside, and this is my humble roots and beginnings that I want to translate into the cooking‚Äù.Dishes from his hometown in central France‚Äôs Auvergne region¬†‚Äì the same ones his mother used to cook at home¬†‚Äì will be given a luxed-up twist.‚ÄúThere is a dish that is very typical for my hometown and something that I grew up eating a lot. It's called chou farci. It's a cabbage that has been blanched and then stuffed with pork,‚Äù he said. While it‚Äôs traditionally considered a humble dish of leftovers, ‚ÄúWe add a little bit of luxury¬†‚Äì we have a bit of foie gras here, and we balance the level of richness with a little bit of (prune). And then we put it back together and bake it‚Äù.Chef de cuisine Loic Portalier, who comes to Claudine from Louise in Hong Kong, took the time to show us the steps of making the dish, from layering the cabbage and pork to rolling it into a dense sphere to prepare it for baking.Royer‚Äôs early food memories growing up in France are of ‚Äúvery simple, very humble dishes that bring a lot of joy to the table‚Äù, he said. A lentil salad, for example, ‚Äúbecause lentils are quite popular in our region. We used to do lentil salad with pork. My mum would saute¬†pork trotter quickly in a pan and we would eat it with a very intense vinegar dressing. We're going to have a version of that here, a little bit elevated again.‚ÄúBut, you know, I think the pleasure of food can come from something very simple. And I don't really value the notion of luxury ingredients. I think a piece of carrot or parsnip can be as beautiful as lobster or caviar.‚ÄùHe added:¬†‚ÄúThe restaurant is named after my mum, but the concept really is what I think a French restaurant could and should be in 2021.‚ÄúI think the ultimate pleasure and the ultimate goal of us as cooks, as chefs, is when you can manage to give emotion to people through food and cuisine. And this is what my grandma Odette and my mum Claudine did¬†‚Äì giving us pleasure and happiness through food.‚ÄùClaudine is at 39C Harding Road.¬†We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

TAIPEI (AFP) - Malaysian rapper Namewee, who penned a viral Mandarin pop song poking fun at Chinese nationalists, said on Monday (Nov 15) he had no regrets about being blacklisted by Beijing as his track hit more than 30 million views on YouTube.Released last month, Fragile, which features Australian singer Kimberley Chen, has become a viral sensation across Asia and beyond despite being scrubbed by censors in mainland China.The track masquerades as a saccharine love song but is littered with digs towards ""little pinks"" - a term for China's online army of nationalist commenters - as well as Beijing's authoritarian government.""I never limit myself or impose self-censorship,"" Namewee, 38, told reporters in Taipei as he and Chen sipped champagne to toast their track's 30 million views milestone.""To me, good creations should come from the heart, they should be sincere,"" he added.Mandarin-speaking singers, film stars and celebrities rarely court controversy when it comes to China given Beijing's long track record of punishing those deemed critical of its rule. A misspoken word can quickly lead to an artist being frozen out of the world's largest Mandarin-speaking market and a career in ruins.But the willingness of Namewee and Chen, 27, to take on taboo subjects has struck a chord as China grows increasingly assertive on the world stage under President Xi Jinping.""The lyrics are clever because they sound like a love (gone bad) song, but in every line there is a reference to either the fragile 'feelings' of the Chinese government or riffing on Chinese Communist Party rhetoric,"" DJ Hatfield, a professor of Musicology at National Taiwan University, told AFP.Over the last four weeks, Fragile has been a top trending YouTube video in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia as well as making smaller waves among Chinese diaspora fans in places like Australia, Canada and the United States.Within days of the track's release, Namewee and Chen's Chinese social media accounts were taken down and their music censored while state media accused the pair of insulting the country.Namewee and Chen are both currently based in Taiwan and have brushed off their blacklisting.""When you say I am banned, I don't feel that way,"" Namewee said. ""I feel it's the people who can't listen to this song that are being banned.""",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/articles/2021/11/16/md_weemengchee_161121.jpg?itok=MgucaqDO&timestamp=1637031742,"3 glamorous new women's watches for your year-end festivities - CNA
The mood might be muted, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt don choice accessories that spark joy. Enter Jaeger-LeCoultre‚Äôs trio of tickers that shimmer with diamonds, mother-of-pearl and artfully rendered floral motifs. In partnership with Jaeger-LeCoultre.Jaeger-LeCoultre's Reverso One Cordonnet Jewellery is encrusted with 1,104 diamonds totalling 7.84 carats. (Photo: Jaeger-LeCoultre)Jaeger-LeCoultre has a lot going for it. It has years of marketable history, a reputation for superior movements, and it even has a few iconic designs under its belt. This year‚Äôs feminine offerings showcase all of those things, but they also lean heavily into rare handcrafts to provide a generous helping of loveliness.A HEAVENLY SIGHTThere have been so many variations of the Rendez-Vous Jewellery Moon watches that it‚Äôs hard to imagine new ways for it to stand out. And yet somehow Jaeger-LeCoultre has managed to create the starriest one yet.The Rendez-Vous Jewellery Dazzling Moon Lazura follows the same eye-catching template as its forebears, with dramatic, graduated numerals forming an arc over an extra-large moon phase display.What makes this reference so breathtaking is its vivid lapis lazuli dial and an exceptionally brilliant bezel made of 36 larger diamonds on the outer ring and 73 smaller ones on the inside. This prong- and grain-set diamond bezel is what characterises the Dazzling models in the Rendez-Vous collection.The rest of the sparkle comes from the 36mm rose gold case, gilt hands, numerals and constellations, and a mother-of-pearl moon. The moon phase isn‚Äôt just impressive in size ‚Äì it is also accurate for 972 years (the average in fine watchmaking is 122 years).An additional hand-polished gold star, also known as the Rendez-Vous indicator, can be adjusted via the crown at 2 o‚Äôclock to mark the time of a special appointment. The manufacture Calibre 935 is self-winding, with Cotes de Geneve decoration on the plates and rotor.IN THE LOOPThese days, with watchmakers touting the interchangeability of their straps and bracelets, the real novelty is a wristlet you don‚Äôt want to swap out.Back in the early 1930s, early examples of Reverso watches for women featured little silk ropes and leather cords to help fasten the watches to dainty wrists. These inspired the contemporary Reverso One Cordonnet watches, launched in celebration of the Reverso‚Äôs 85th anniversary in 2016.Cordonnet means ‚Äúfine braid‚Äù in French, and for the collection‚Äôs 90th anniversary this year, that braid has returned in a livery of gold and diamonds. The Reverso One Cordonnet Jewellery is encrusted with 1,104 diamonds totalling 7.84 carats. Grain-setting was used to set the stones in the case, a technique that uses tiny gold beads to hold the gems closely in place. Since Jaeger-LeCoultre has its own Ateliers des Metiers Rares (Rare Handcrafts workshop), it has access to artisans skilled enough to set the diamonds on the watch‚Äôs many sloping sides.The front-facing dial features gold Arabic numerals on a mother-of-pearl base, framed by diamond-set brackets and a geometric cut-out centre paved with even more diamonds. The other side has an onyx face and diamond-set sunbeams to act as hour markers. This petite piece is powered by the manually wound Calibre 844 with a 38-hour power reserve.GARDEN PARTYLike most metiers d‚Äôart watches, the Reverso One Precious Flowers series is a culmination of several artistic disciplines. This time, the Ateliers des Metiers Rares relied on engraving and enamelling on top of gem-setting to create the luscious leaves and petals of lilies and arums in four stunning models.The two slightly less glittery models are the White Lilies in white gold and the Pink Arums in pink gold. For the White Lilies, the soothing shades of blue and white were achieved by filling the hand-engraved foliage with enamel, and filling the background with precisely cut slivers of mother-of-pearl.The petals of the Pink Arums are executed in the same way, but diamonds fill in its leaves and black lacquer was used to create its dramatically contrasting background. Both of these images are framed in grain-set diamonds that cover the entire case.The Purple Arums and Blue Arums (in pink gold and white gold respectively) pile on far more diamonds. The flowers and leaves are engraved in relief and filled with richly coloured enamel, but the backgrounds are fully paved with snow-set diamonds. Because of how tedious the snow-setting technique is, where seemingly randomly sized stones fit snugly together for a shimmering blanket effect, the setting alone took 95 hours. And unlike the White Lilies and Pink Arums, these two references have floral designs that extend into the case sides.Each version is a limited edition of 10 and uses the hand-wound Calibre 846.We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

The creation of nanoscale computers for use in precision health care has long been a dream of many scientists and health care providers. Now, for the first time, researchers at Penn State have produced a nanocomputing agent that can control the function of a particular protein that is involved in cell movement and cancer metastasis. The research paves the way for the construction of complex nanoscale computers for the prevention and treatment of cancer and other diseases.

                                         
                                                  





Nikolay Dokholyan, G. Thomas Passananti Professor, Penn State College of Medicine, and his colleagues‚Äîincluding Yashavantha Vishweshwaraiah, postdoctoral scholar in pharmacology, Penn State‚Äîcreated a transistor-like 'logic gate,' which is a type of computational operation in which multiple inputs control an output.
""Our logic gate is just the beginning of what you could call cellular computing,"" he said, ""but it is a major milestone because it demonstrates the ability to embed conditional operations in a protein and control its function, said Dokholyan. ""It will allow us to gain a deeper understanding of human biology and disease and introduces possibilities for the development of precision therapeutics.""
The team's logic gate comprised two sensor domains designed to respond to two inputs‚Äîlight and the drug rapamycin. The team targeted the protein focal adhesion kinase (FAK) because it is involved in cell adhesion and movement, which are initial steps in the development of metastatic cancer.
""First, we introduced a rapamycin-sensitive domain, called uniRapr, which the lab had previously designed and studied, into the gene that encodes FAK,"" said Vishweshwaraiah. ""Next, we introduced the domain, LOV2, which is sensitive to light. Once we optimized both domains, we combined them into one final logic-gate design.""
The team inserted the modified gene into HeLa cancer cells and, using confocal microscopy, observed the cells in vitro. They studied the effects of each of the inputs separately, as well as the combined effects of the inputs, on the cells' behavior.
They discovered that not only could they rapidly activate FAK using light and rapamycin, but also that this activation resulted in the cells undergoing internal changes that enhanced their adhesive capabilities, which ultimately decreased their motility.
Their results published today (Nov. 16) in the journal Nature Communications.
""We show for the first time that we can build a functioning nanocomputing agent within living cells that can control cell behavior,"" said Vishweshwaraiah. ""We also discovered some interesting features of the FAK protein, such as the changes it triggers in cells when it is activated.""
Dokholyan noted that the team hopes to eventually test these nanocomputing agents in vivo within living organisms.

""How Soil Microbes Help To Keep Carbon in Healthy Ground""

The largest terrestrial carbon sink on earth is the planet‚Äôs soil. One of the fears that many scientists have is that a warming planet will liberate significant portions of the soil‚Äôs carbon, turning it into carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, and so further accelerate the pace of planetary warming. One of the key players in this story is the microbe: invisible, and yet the predominant form of life on earth.‚ÄúMicrobes are everywhere and in everything,‚Äù says¬†Kristen DeAngelis, professor of microbiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and senior author of the study, recently published in¬†ISME Communications. ‚ÄúThere are billions of microbes in one teaspoon of soil; a trillion times more microbes than stars in the known universe. And yet, we don‚Äôt know that much about them.‚ÄùIt seems that microbial activity has a large effect on the atmosphere, especially in how microbes help convert organic carbon‚Äîthink of all the fallen leaves, rotting tree stumps, grasses and other organic matter‚Äîinto soil, keeping that carbon out of the atmosphere. It‚Äôs this soil organic matter, or SOM, that acts not only as a carbon sink but also gives soil its ability to absorb water and prevent flooding as well as to be a nutritious source of energy for plant life.And yet, it‚Äôs not entirely clear¬†how¬†microbes form SOM. ‚ÄúOur study sheds light on the relevance of microbial community composition and activity to shape the composition of SOM,‚Äù says lead author Luiz A. Domeignoz-Horta, now at the University of Zurich‚Äôs department of evolutionary biology and environmental studies, but who completed his research for this paper as part of DeAngelis‚Äôs lab at UMass Amherst. ‚ÄúBefore our study, no one knew that the particular composition of microbial communities was important for the formation of SOM.‚ÄùThe team conducted an experiment in which they inoculated ‚Äúmodel soils,‚Äù or sterile mixtures of sand and clay, with different microbial communities, and then fed the microbes sugars and vitamins so that they could grow over the course of four months, building SOM the whole time. The group was then able to measure the SOM generated by these different communities, as well as to test how persistent the SOM was depending on the microbial community that created it.To do this, the team subjected the soils to a controlled process of pyrolysis‚Äîor heating, up to 650¬†O¬†C, in the absence of oxygen. ‚ÄúAs we heated the soils, we recorded when the soil began to release carbon gas. More ‚Äòthermally stable‚Äô samples of SOM reached temperatures above 400O¬†C, while the less thermally stable samples emitted more carbon in the 200 ‚Äì 300O¬†C range,‚Äù says Domeignoz-Horta, who led the team‚Äôs international collaboration. ‚ÄúThis assay was performed by our soil biochemists‚Äô collaborators in Switzerland, and it is a great example of the importance of a multidisciplinary research team to advance science,‚Äù observes Domeignoz-Horta.What the researchers discovered is not only further evidence linking microbes to SOM formation, but that different microbial communities shaped the composition of SOM in distinct ways, including the SOM‚Äôs ability to withstand being turned into CO2. While it seems that bacteria are primarily responsible for driving the creation of SOM in this model system, it is the presence of fungal communities that render soil able to withstand warming temperatures.‚ÄúI see this invisible world of bacteria and fungi, the microbial world, everywhere,‚Äù says DeAngelis. ‚ÄúMost microbes help us, and we need to know more about them to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our own world.‚ÄùReference:¬†Domeignoz-Horta LA, Shinfuku M, Junier P, et al.

After decades of uncertainty, researchers have confirmed the existence of lunar carbon dioxide cold traps that could potentially contain solid carbon dioxide.After decades of uncertainty, researchers have confirmed the existence of lunar carbon dioxide cold traps that could potentially contain solid carbon dioxide.The discovery will likely have a major influence in shaping future lunar missions and could impact the feasibility of a sustained robot or human presence on the moon.
In the permanently shadowed regions at the poles of our moon, temperatures dip below those in the coldest areas of Pluto, allowing for carbon dioxide cold traps. In these cold traps, carbon dioxide molecules could freeze and remain in solid form even during peak temperatures in the lunar summer.
Future human or robot explorers could use the solid carbon dioxide in these cold traps to produce fuel or materials for longer lunar stays. The carbon dioxide and other potential volatile organics could also help scientists better understand the origin of water and other elements on the moon.
Although cold traps have been predicted by planetary scientists for years, this new study is the first to firmly establish and map the presence of carbon dioxide cold traps. To find the coldest spots on the moon's surface, researchers analyzed 11 years of temperature data from the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment, an instrument flying aboard NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.
The new research, published in the AGU journal Geophysical Research Letters, which publishes high-impact, short-format reports with immediate implications spanning all Earth and space sciences, shows that these cold traps include several pockets concentrated around the lunar southern pole. The total area of these carbon dioxide traps totals 204 square kilometers, with the largest area in the Amundsen Crater hosting 82 square kilometers of traps. In these areas, temperatures continually remain below 60 degrees Kelvin (about minus 352 degrees Fahrenheit.)
The existence of carbon dioxide cold traps does not guarantee the existence of solid carbon dioxide on the moon, but this verification does make it highly likely that future missions could find carbon dioxide ice there, according to the researchers.  
""I think when I started this, the question was, 'Can we confidently say there are carbon dioxide cold traps on the moon or not?'"" said Norbert Sch√∂rghofer, a planetary scientist at the Planetary Science Institute and lead author on the study. ""My surprise was that they're actually, definitely there. It could have been that we can't establish their existence, [they might have been] one pixel on a map... so I think the surprise was that we really found contiguous regions which are cold enough, beyond doubt.""
Managing the moon
The existence of carbon dioxide traps on the moon will likely have implications for the planning of future lunar exploration and international policy regarding the resource.
If there is indeed solid carbon dioxide in these cold traps, it could potentially be used in a variety of ways. Future space explorers could use the resource in the production of steel as well as rocket fuel and biomaterials, which would both be essential for sustained robot or human presence on the moon. This potential has already attracted interest from governments and private companies.
Scientists could also study lunar carbon to understand how organic compounds form and what kind of molecules can be naturally produced in these harsh environments. 
The carbon dioxide cold traps could also help scientists answer long-standing questions about the origins of water and other volatiles in the Earth-moon system, according to Paul Hayne, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado, Boulder who was not involved in the study.
Carbon dioxide could be a tracer for the sources of water and other volatiles on the lunar surface, helping scientists to understand how they arrived on the moon and on Earth.
""These should be high-priority sites to target for future landed missions,"" Hayne said. ""This sort of pinpoints where you might go on the lunar surface to answer some of these big questions about volatiles on the moon and their delivery from elsewhere in the solar system.""

And if you own an Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One or a gaming PC, the subscription service that lets you download and fully play its library of games is almost too good to pass up.¬†But that wasn't always the case. As GQ reports, Xbox Game Pass could have spun off in a different direction entirely, and it's one that doesn't sound all that great. The service's concept actually dates back to 2013, during the dawn of the Xbox One, and was originally going to focus on rentals.Rentals didn't last long as a concept, however, as the rise of services like Spotify and Netflix seemed to tell Microsoft that a subscription model would have been preferable to a rental system.Xbox's head of gaming ecosystems, Sarah Bond, explained that not even the subscription model for Xbox Game Pass was well received at first: ""They were like, 'no way, [Game Pass] is going to devalue games.'""And as an untested concept at the time, that's not an unreasonable opinion to have. Of course, Game Pass debuted with the launch of Sea of Thieves which, after spending some time finding its sea legs, has since clocked over 25 million players.Similarly large numbers are attracted to Xbox Game Pass releases even today, with the recently launched Forza Horizon 5 already drawing in 6 million players during its first week.We couldn't be happier that Microsoft shifted to the subscription model we know for Xbox Game Pass, as it might not even be around today if the company stuck to its guns with a rental service. If it did, the service likely would've bit the dust like Blockbuster Video, or faded into obscurity much the same way LoveFilm did. Anyone remember LoveFilm?It's also worth noting that streaming king Netflix also began as a DVD rental service. The company didn't grow exponentially until it shifted to its current subscription model. As such, it's likely that Microsoft saw the sea change at the time, and decided to pivot away from the diminishing rental format.Not only are rentals something of an outdated concept in the entertainment space, they simply don't work well at all for gaming. And sure, some apps do still offer a digital rental option, like Prime Video, but that's a last resort when streaming that movie or show simply isn't an option.As for gaming, imagine coming to the end of your rental time right before you're about to take on the final boss. Your character draws their sword, the sweeping orchestra kicks in, and all of a sudden you get a pop-up prodding you to ""add more game time to keep playing!"" It would completely sour the moment and instantly disintegrate any immersion you would otherwise have had.EA Play's 10-hour trials, available to download through the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier of subscription, are probably the closest thing the service still has to a rental system. But in this case, it's still a part of your monthly sub fee and available to play at no extra cost. These are also for very recent releases like FIFA 22 and Battlefield 2042, so it's understandable that EA would make them available in a more limited capacity.Rhys is a Staff Writer for TechRadar, and while relatively fresh to the role, he's been writing in a professional capacity for years.
