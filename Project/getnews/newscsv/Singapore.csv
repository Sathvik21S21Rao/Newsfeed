"Football: Italian fans must not travel to UK for Euro final, says British minister - CNA
LONDON: British transport minister Grant Shapps has told Italian football fans not to try to travel to England for the final of this year's Euro 2020 tournament on Sunday (Jul 11). England face Italy on Sunday in the final at London's Wembley Stadium, where crowds of around 60,000 people are expected but few of them will be Italians as Britain's travel rules require arrivals from there to quarantine for 10 days.Asked on Friday what he would say to Italian fans trying to get to the game, Shapps said: ""'Don't' is the answer to that simple question.""""If we detect people are coming in just for the football, they won't be allowed in and in fact, lots of charter flights and direct flights have been cancelled on that basis,"" he told Times Radio.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Kasper Schmeichel had laser pen shone at his face as Harry Kane stepped up for England penalty - Yahoo Singapore News
Denmark goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel had a laser pen shone at his face as Harry Kane stepped up for England's penalty in their Euro 2020 semi final clash.ITV showed footage of a green laser flashing across Schmeichel’s face as he prepared to face Kane’s extra-time penalty at Wembley on Wednesday night.The goalkeeper did not appear to be aware of the attempted distraction and saved the penalty, before Kane tucked away the rebound to score what would be the winning goal.ITV presenter Mark Pougatch condemned the unknown perpetrator.He said: “One thing we have spotted just as Harry Kane took the penalty and which is completely unacceptable and ridiculous…look, someone’s got a laser pen in the stands.“Whoever they are they’re an idiot, him or her, and we can just hope that it didn’t put Kasper Schmeichel off because it’s stupid and he doesn’t deserve that.“That sort of thing, nobody wants to see.”Further controversy surrounded the penalty–which ultimately sent England into their first final since 1966–Raheem Sterling was accused of diving to win the spot kick, which came in the first half of extra time.There was also a second ball on the pitch when Sterling received the ball at the start of the move. Referees normally stop play in accordance with the laws of the game if there are two balls on the field.They can use their discretion and ignore it if the ball is not interfering with play, but on this occasion the stray ball was in the vicinity of Sterling and the Denmark defenders and could conceivably be said to be causing a distraction.Watch: This is how England fans in London celebrated when the Three Lions scored...Read More",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1BgPpqBsS90ev_.pawN.HA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcyMA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.9j6rTLlULUQJLVwhq3pWg--~B/aD0xNTM2O3c9MjA0ODthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/f1860676a6e99b9e26de6da12b884b28,"Vietnam SEA Games postponed to 2022 over Covid-19 concerns - The Straits Times
SINGAPORE – The Nov 21-Dec 2 South-east Asian Games in Vietnam have been postponed to next year, drawing mixed reactions from the Singapore sports fraternity. After the SEA Games Federation working committee met yesterday, the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) issued a statement saying “it was decided that the SEA Games will not be held this year”.It added: “The Vietnam NOC will explore new dates for consideration. The SNOC will adjust the selection policy accordingly to reflect the new dates once the details are confirmed”.This confirms earlier speculation that the Hanoi Games would be rescheduled as the Vietnam Olympic Committee (VOC) had flagged concerns over the viability of staging it this year with the . The 40-sport meet was set to feature over 10,000 athletes, coaches and other participants.Vietnam, which last hosted the Games in 2003, has set aside a budget of US$69 million (S$91.3 million) to stage the competition. While it was reported to have introduced a “no vaccine, no participation” policy for the event, the number of cases in the country has increased by almost 10 times since March to more than 23,000.Vietnamese news publication Phap Luat Online reported last month that the VOC had sent a letter to its regional counterparts proposing the postponement of this year’s edition to July next year “due to the complicated situation of the Covid-19 pandemic”.But ESPN reported that a majority of the national Olympic committees, including Singapore’s, had “voted against” the proposal to move the event to July.The date is problematic for countries like Singapore and Malaysia as the higher-profile Commonwealth Games in Birmingham are set for July 28-Aug 8, and next year’s sporting calendar is also packed with other major multi-sport events including the Winter Olympics in Beijing (February) and Asian Games in Hangzhou (September).Varin Tansuphasiri, Games Council member and deputy secretary of the Thai Olympic Committee told AFP yesterday that Vietnam is proposing April or May next year as an alternative date. Singapore table tennis player Clarence Chew, who won a men’s singles silver in 2019, was disappointed to hear about the postponement but said that “the safety of the athletes, officials, spectators should be number one priority”. He added: “Next year, we will face a challenging year as we not only have to prepare for the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games but also the SEA Games. But I believe, as athletes, we are able to cope with the challenges and create positive outcomes.”Singapore swimming’s national training centre head coach Gary Tan shared that their training regimen will be tweaked to adapt to the delay, and there will be discussions with the SNOC on the qualifying time frames to ensure they have the best team for all three Games.He said: “Periodisation has to be spot on due to the fact we have multiple Games coming up. Picking the team will also be crucial, where we need to discuss internally to understand what are our key meets, who are our key personnel based off qualification, and decide how we can peak at the respective meets.”However, national bowler New Hui Fen, who won three gold medals at the 2019 SEA Games in the Philippines, called the news a “blessing in disguise” as this year’s edition would have clashed with the Nov 6-14 World Championships.She said: “With the current Covid-19 situation, there have been many changes in our daily lives. Adapting to changes, in a way, stretched my comfort zones wider. Now that the SEA Games is postponed, there is a possibility I can compete in both the World Championships and SEA Games. “Hopefully the SEA Games can be held safely in 2022 and be close to pre-Covid days where spectators are allowed.”",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/articles/2021/07/08/eb-seagames-070821_2x.jpg?itok=25w3UsP-&timestamp=1625734647,"Ramos had blunt Arsenal snub reason, despite offer smashing PSG deal - Teamtalk.com
Sergio Ramos snubbed serious interest from Arsenal and Manchester City in favour of a transfer to Paris Saint-Germain, according to a report.The 35-year-old made headlines earlier this year . After 671 games and over 100 goals, he became a free agent despite his club’s best efforts to keep him. As such, the race began to snap up the legendary Spain international, who had initial links with a move to Manchester United.While Paris Saint-Germain won the race for Ramos, though, Goal claims that he could still have moved to the Premier League.Indeed, Arsenal and City both tabled lucrative contract offers for the centre-back.The Gunners offered him £15million per season on a two-year contract. Ramos has signed a two-year deal at PSG, but will take home £13million each campaign.Despite offering more, the defender rejected Arsenal because they do not feature in next season’s Champions League.Ramos has made a career out of leading his club to Europe’s top trophy. Consequently, he wanted to continue that legacy in the French capital.In fact, the allure of potentially winning PSG’s first Champions League would also have proved a key factor.Arsenal have , though, and have reportedly agreed personal terms.Premier League champions City feature in Europe’s premier competition. Like PSG and Arsenal, they put a two-year contract on the table for Ramos.Still, Ramos could not turn down a move to France.Ramos will also be looking to get back into the Spain team after being left out for Euro 2020.

SINGAPORE: Despite an economic downturn, the incidence of salary claims made by workers last year declined, driven largely by a fall in claims made by foreign employees.The total incidence of salary claims in 2020 fell to 2.15 per 1,000 employees, down from , according to the Employment Standards Report 2020 released on Friday (Jul 9).The figure crept up for local workers to 1.61 per 1,000 local employees in 2020, compared to 1.53 in 2019. This was higher in industries such as accommodation and food services activities, information and communications, and construction, some of which were severely impacted by the ""circuit breaker"" and movement restrictions in 2020, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) in the report.For foreign workers, there were 3.47 salary claims per 1,000 foreign employees, compared to 4.98 in 2019. The industries with the highest incidence of salary claims were arts, entertainment and recreation, accommodation and food services activities, as well as construction. Disputes over basic salaries made up most of the claims but the agencies noted that the proportion of claims relating to end of employment issues, such as salary in-lieu of notice and encashment of unconsumed annual leave increased in 2020.This was due to disagreements on whether leave had been taken during the circuit breaker and if salaries were owed during the period of business disruption.The report said that for foreign workers, the fall in claims was mainly because authorities had taken steps to address potential disputes due to the impact of COVID-19 on businesses.When dormitories went into lockdown around April 2020, MOM introduced a requirement for all employers with workers living in dormitories to pay salaries electronically. From May last year, all employers in the construction sector, which traditionally accounted for a high percentage of salary non-payment cases, had to submit monthly declarations on the status of salary payment to their foreign employees.In June last year, MOM introduced a module on a mobile application for migrant workers so that they can report any salary, bank account and remittance issues.For owed salaries, TADM actively engaged employers and facilitated salary resolution for about 7,000 migrant workers between June and December 2020, without requiring employees to come forward to lodge these salary claims.“As a result, salary issues did not feature prominently in the management of COVID-19 at the dormitories,” said the report.Senior Minister of State for Manpower Koh Poh Koon said in a Facebook post that despite the weakened economic conditions, Singapore’s employment standards remained stable last year. ""Employers and employees had worked together and made mutual sacrifices to sustain businesses and preserve jobs,"" he wrote.Mr Kandhavel Periyasamy, TADM general manager noted that the incidence of salary claims among local employees increased slightly, especially in industries more affected by the circuit breaker and movement restrictions. ""We will watch this trend closely and adapt our interventions and strategies accordingly,” he said.MORE THAN 9 IN 10 WORKERS REPAIDFor all workers, MOM had in March 2020 introduced a requirement for employers with 10 or more employees to notify the ministry of any cost-saving measures that affect employees' monthly salaries. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) then proactively engaged employers who had made severe pay cuts to check whether the cost-saving measures were implemented fairly, the report said.TAFEP persuaded employers to “exercise compassion in supporting their employees”, it added.The median duration of salary arrears claimed by foreign workers also fell to 2.3 months, compared to 3.4 months in 2019. This indicates that they are reporting lapses in salary payments earlier. For local employees, the median duration was 1.1 months in 2020.The total recovered sum to employees amounted to about S$15 million and more than nine in 10 employees (92 per cent) who filed claims fully recovered their salaries, said the report.Of the remaining 8 per cent of employees, 5 percentage points recovered their salaries partially. Most of these claims involved employers who were unable to make full payment for their workers’ owed salaries due to financial difficulties. MOM and TADM helped the affected workers recover part of their salary arrears through other means, such as by negotiating for settlement payments from security bond insurers or main contractors, or helping lower-wage employees get help through the Short-Term Relief Fund (STRF) or Migrant Workers’ Assistance Fund (MWAF).“The remaining employees did not recover any salaries and were mainly higher income earners who did not qualify for financial relief through the STRF or MWAF,” the report noted.MOM suspended the work pass privileges of all employers who did not fully repay their employees. It added that less than 1 per cent of the salary claims lodged in 2020 involved ""wilful employers"" who refused to make full payment of the salary arrears despite having the means to do so. MOM said it investigates these employers with a view of prosecuting them.MOST WRONGFUL DISMISSAL CLAIMS “UNSUBSTANTIATED”The overall incidence of wrongful dismissal claims remained low at 0.39 claims per 1,000 employees, the agencies said.While it spiked in the second quarter of 2020, the incidence of such claims “stabilised” in the last two quarters of 2020. Many of the dismissal claims in the second quarter of 2020 were lodged by employees who were terminated abruptly, due in part to the restrictions in face-to-face meetings during the circuit breaker. However, most of these employers had fulfilled their contractual obligations, said the report.Of the wrongful dismissal claims assessed by TADM, about three-quarters (74 per cent) were found to be unsubstantiated, the report said. “Many of these claims had arisen from disputes over work performance, poor communication between the employer and employee or business restructuring due to the lacklustre economy,"" it added.For such claims, TADM will explain to the employees the lack of basis for their claims, help them seek closure to their grievances, and refer them to financial assistance programmes such as the COVID-19 Recovery Grant or job facilitation support where applicable.For the 26 per cent of claims that were substantiated, TADM will require the employer to address the claims, such as by compensating the employee, clearing up any miscommunication and/or facilitating the employee’s job search.Seventy per cent of wrongful dismissal claims lodged in 2020 were concluded at TADM within two months, it said, with the remaining complex claims ""generally concluding"" between two and six months.ONLINE OUTREACHDispute resolution was mainly carried out online last year due to the pandemic, and more than 600 cases per month were handled on the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) platform. Parties could use email, WhatsApp Business messages, and online conferencing platforms to discuss and settle their disputes, said the report.In the next phases of development, TADM said it will focus on enhancing the usability of the system to cater to different users' profile and improve their access to relevant material, and explore the use of artificial intelligence and scenario-based conversations to guide users in their decision-making.More than three-quarters (76 per cent) of salary claims were resolved at TADM within two months, while complex claims were ""generally concluded"" between two and six months. The cases that took longer usually required further fact-finding when parties presented conflicting accounts or evidence. The proportion of salary claims concluded within two months decreased in 2020 partly due to the weak economic climate which made it more difficult for parties to agree on the payment terms, the report said.",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg,"Countries using Chinese, AstraZeneca Covid-19 shots increasingly eye boosters - The Straits Times
NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - Growing concern that Covid-19 vaccines being deployed across much of the developing world aren't capable of thwarting the Delta variant is prompting some countries to look at offering third doses to bolster immunity against more-infectious virus strains.Though definitive evidence is yet to emerge backing the need for so-called ""booster"" shots, health officials from Thailand to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have already decided to offer the extra doses to some people already inoculated with vaccines from Chinese makers Sinovac Biotech Ltd, Sinopharm and from AstraZeneca Plc.Officials are being motivated by concerns that Delta and other variants appear to be breaking down defences of vaccines not made from the super-effective messenger RNA technology, or mRNA.In places like Mongolia and the UAE, high levels of coverage with Chinese shots using the older, less effective inactivated vaccine platform hasn't stopped a surge in cases. In the Seychelles, five people Research shows that the Delta mutation is powerful enough to bringing down protection to below 90 per cent.The effectiveness of AstraZeneca's viral vector vaccine against symptomatic infections caused by the variant was lower at 60 per cent, a study showed, though it can still prevent more than 90 per cent of hospitalisations.Countries are hoping a booster - either mRNA or a dose of another shot previously taken - could bolster protection ahead of the return of colder weather that's optimal for the virus's spread.Unlike western developers, Sinovac and Sinopharm have shared little about how their vaccines could protect against variants.Dr Shao Yiming, a researcher with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, said in May that preliminary studies indicated Chinese vaccines were still protective against variants emerging from India, without elaborating.The two inactivated vaccines produced by Sinopharm were 73 per cent and 78 per cent effective against symptomatic Covid in phase III trials.Various results from Sinovac's clinical trials across Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey put efficacy at a wide range of 50 per cent to over 80 per cent, which has fuelled uncertainty about how well it works.""We recognise that the weaker vaccines in particular seem to lose their ability to protect against Covid-19 relatively quickly, particularly against the variant strains,"" said Professor Nikolai Petrovsky from the College of Medicine and Public Health at Australia's Flinders University. ""Even the better vaccines seem to be showing increasing levels of vaccine failure due to variant infections.""Yet any plans by wealthier nations to acquire additional shots stands to further strain global supply and exacerbate the inequality gap that has left poor countries with fewer inoculations.The  to help meet a goal of vaccinating at least 40 per cent % of every country's population by the end of the year. Global deaths passed 4 million this week, as the disparity leaves poorer places exposed to outbreaks.Giving extra doses ""could easily divert one to two billion doses of vaccines over the coming 12 months to boost people already immunised that might otherwise go to developing countries where people have yet to receive their first immunisation,"" Prof Petrovsky said.Pfizer Inc. CEO Albert Bourla tweeted Thursday that the company believes a booster dose ""will likely be necessary to maintain highest levels of protection"" against Covid, with initial data from its booster study demonstrating that the added dose was eliciting five-to-10 fold higher antibody response.The drugmaker plans to request US emergency authorisation in August for a third booster dose of its shot, based on early data showing it can increase immune protection from Covid.The WHO has expressed caution in encouraging third doses. Chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said in June that such a recommendation was unnecessary and premature given the paucity of data on booster shots and the fact that high-risk individuals in much of the world still haven't been fully vaccinated.But governments are racing ahead as the Delta variant spreads to more than 100 countries after devastating India, where it was first identified. The concern is particularly acute in places which had earlier relied on Chinese vaccines, which are available in nearly 100 nations.In the Middle East, some countries have already started offering booster shots - including Pfizer and Sinopharm - for people who completed their vaccinations months ago, mostly with Sinopharm.Thailand plans to use vaccines from AstraZeneca and Pfizer as boosters for healthcare workers who earlier received Sinovac shots. The Indonesian Doctors Association this week also called for booster shots for health workers, after some medical staffers died despite being fully inoculated with Sinovac and AstraZeneca.Preliminary studies from Thailand show that a first dose of Sinovac followed by an AstraZeneca shot three to four weeks later can elicit a stronger immune response than two doses of the Sinovac vaccine.Even China, which has fully immunised more than a third of its 1.4 billion people with homegrown vaccines, has a study underway to evaluate the benefit of booster shots.Sinovac CEO Yin Weidong has said a third shot of the company's vaccine, given three to six months after full inoculation, could raise antibody levels by as much as 20 times.China is currently reviewing the BioNTech vaccine for approval. A few options are being considered by officials, including using it a booster shot for people already fully inoculated with local vaccines, according to people familiar with the matter, asking not to be named as the talks are not public.No decision has been made, and adding the mRNA shot as another option in China's general rollout is also being discussed, the people said.""If you can explore different combinations, there frequently is a combination where you get a better outcome than just using the same vaccine twice in a row,"" said Prof Shane Crotty from the Centre for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research at California's La Jolla Institute for Immunology.

"Bigger push to vaccinate more seniors: Ong Ye Kung - The Straits Times
A bigger push will be made to encourage more seniors to get vaccinated - including doing house visits if needed - as they remain the most vulnerable to Covid-19, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said yesterday.He pointed to how, in countries with higher vaccination rates that have opened up, most of those who have suffered severe illness from Covid-19 are still the elderly.""What we really need to do is to get more of our seniors vaccinated,"" he said during a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19.""If you compare across ages, those above 70 have the lowest first dose and booking rates. It really should be the other way around.""Among seniors over 70 years old, 71 per cent have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or have booked an appointment, he said. For those aged 60 to 69, the figure is 85 per cent. For those 50 to 59, as well as 40 to 49, it is 86 per cent.For those aged 30 to 39, the figure is 78 per cent. For those 20 to 29, it is 80 per cent, and it is the same for those aged 12 to 19.Mr Ong, co-chair of the task force, said that in countries such as the United Kingdom, United States, and Israel, which have opened up, infections have also gone up among young people.This is because they are out and about and less vaccinated, he said. ""Hospitalisation and severe illness numbers are quite stable, but mostly among the old.""He added: ""It's not a matter of the elderly saying 'I don't go out therefore I'm safe'. It's not that at all, because these days when we look at our infections and our cases, many of our infections have actually occurred at home. Family members can go out and bring the virus back home.""The authorities will be making a bigger push to reach out to seniors, ""knocking on their doors if necessary"", he said.""This is the work we need to do, so any one of us, if we know of an elderly person, a neighbour or a relative, who is still hesitating, please help reach out to them and persuade them.""Lim Min Zhang",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/articles/2021/07/08/ST_20210708_MISENIOR_6676186.jpg?itok=UBzySrJz&timestamp=1625683816,"N.B. pushing to get 75 per cent of eligible residents fully vaccinated against COVID - The Record (New Westminster)

Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, said though the government is sailing toward its targets, vaccination rates remain low among residents under 30. ""The under-30 cohort is our biggest risk factor for COVID transmission at this time,"" Fitzgerald said Wednesday. ""We encourage communities and organizations to think of how they can best reach out to this population in their own areas.""In Nova Scotia, Dr. Robert Strang, the province's chief medical officer of health, made a personal appeal for citizens to continue to seek their shots, even if clinics are busy.

"Researchers bring attack-proof quantum communication two steps forward - Phys.org
Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method for secure communication that uses quantum mechanics to encrypt information. While the security of QKD is unbreakable in principle, if it is incorrectly implemented, vital information could still be stolen by attackers. These are known as side-channel attacks, where the attackers exploit weaknesses in the setup of the information system to eavesdrop on the exchange of secret keys.

                                         
                                                  





Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have developed two methods, one theoretical and one experimental, to ensure that QKD communications cannot be attacked in this way. The first is an ultra-secure cryptography protocol that can be deployed in any communication network that needs long-term security. The second is a first-of-its-kind device that defends QKD systems against bright light pulse attacks by creating a power threshold.
""Rapid advances in quantum computing and algorithmic research mean we can no longer take today's toughest security software for granted. Our two new approaches hold promise to ensuring that the information systems which we use for banking, health and other critical infrastructure and data storage can hold up any potential future attacks,"" said Assistant Professor Charles Lim, from the NUS Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Centre for Quantum Technologies, who led the two research projects.
Future-proof quantum communication protocol
Typically, in QKD, two measurement settings are used—one to generate the key and the other to test the integrity of the channel. In a paper published in the journal Nature Communications on 17 May 2021, the NUS team showed that with their new protocol, users can independently test the other party's encryption device by generating a secret key from two randomly chosen key generation settings instead of one. The researchers demonstrated that introducing an extra set of key-generating measurements for the users makes it harder for the eavesdropper to steal information.
""It's a simple variation of the original protocol that started this field, but it can only be tackled now thanks to significant developments in mathematical tools,"" said Professor Valerio Scarani, who was one of the inventors of this type of method and is a co-author of the paper. He is from the NUS Department of Physics and Centre for Quantum Technologies.
Compared to the original 'device-independent' QKD protocol, the new protocol is easier to set up, and is more tolerant to noise and loss. It also gives users the highest level of security allowable by quantum communications and empowers them to independently verify their own key generation devices.






With the team's setup, all information systems built with 'device-independent' QKD would be free from misconfiguration and mis-implementation. ""Our method allows data to be safe against attackers even if they have unlimited quantum computing power. This approach could lead to a truly secure information system, eliminating all side-channel attacks and allowing end-users to monitor its implementation security easily and with confidence,"" explained Asst Prof Lim.
A first-of-its-kind quantum power limiter device
Quantum cryptography, in practice, uses optical pulses with very low light intensity to exchange data over untrusted networks. Leveraging quantum effects can securely distribute secret keys, generate truly random numbers, and even create banknotes that are mathematically unforgeable.
However, experiments have shown that it is possible to inject bright light pulses into the quantum cryptosystem to break its security. This side-channel attack strategy exploits the way injected bright light is reflected to the outside environment, to reveal the secrets being kept in the quantum cryptosystem.
In a new paper published in PRX Quantum on 7 July 2021, the NUS researchers reported their development of the first optical device to address the issue. It is based on thermo-optical defocusing effects to limit the energy of the incoming light. The researchers use the fact that the energy of the bright light changes the refractive index of the transparent plastic material embedded in the device, thus it sends a fraction of the light out of the quantum channel. This enforces a power limiting threshold.
The NUS team's power limiter can be seen as an optical equivalent of an electric fuse, except that it is reversible and does not burn when the energy threshold is breached. It is highly cost-effective, and can be easily manufactured with off-the-shelf components. It also does not require any power, so it can be easily added to any quantum cryptography system to strengthen its implementation security.
Asst Prof Lim added, ""It is imperative to close the gap between the theory and practice of quantum secure communications if we are to use it for the future Quantum Internet. We do this holistically—on one hand, we design more practical quantum protocols, and on the other hand, we engineer quantum devices that conform closely with the mathematical models assumed by the protocols. In doing so, we can significantly narrow the gap.""

Robots have a hard time improvising, and encountering an unusual surface or obstacle usually means an abrupt stop or hard fall. But researchers at Facebook AI have created a new model for robotic locomotion that adapts in real time to any terrain it encounters, changing its gait on the fly to keep trucking when it hits sand, rocks, stairs, and other sudden changes.Although robotic movement can be versatile and exact, and robots can ""learn"" to climb steps, cross broken terrain and so on, these behaviors are more like individual trained skills that the robot switches between. And although robots like Spot famously can spring back from being pushed or kicked, the system is really just working to correct a physical anomaly while pursuing an unchanged policy of walking. There are some adaptive movement models, but some are very specific (for instance this one based on real insect movements) and others take long enough to work that the robot will certainly have fallen by the time they take effect.Rapid Motor Adaptation, as the team calls it, came from the idea that humans and other animals are able to quickly, effectively, and unconsciously change the way they walk to fit different circumstances.""Say you learn to walk and for the first time you go to the beach. Your foot sinks in, and to pull it out you have to apply more force. It feels weird, but in a few steps you'll be walking naturally just as you do on hard ground. What's the secret there?"" asked senior researcher Jitendra Malik, who is affiliated with Facebook AI and UC Berkeley.Certainly if you've never encountered a beach before, but even later in life when you have, you aren't entering some special ""sand mode"" that lets you walk on soft surfaces. The way you change your movement happens automatically and without any real understanding of the external environment.Visualization of the simulation environment. Of course the robot would not perceive any of this visually. Image credit: Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMU""What's happening is your body responds to the differing physical conditions by sensing the differing consequences of those conditions on the body itself,"" Malik explained — and the RMA system works in similar fashion. ""When we walk in new conditions, in a very short time, half a second or less, we have made enough measurements that we are estimating what these conditions are, and we modify the walking policy.""To punctuate the total internality of the RMA approach, Malik notes that the robot uses no visual input whatsoever. But people and animals with no vision can walk just fine, so why shouldn't a robot? But since it's impossible to estimate the ""externalities"" such as the exact friction coefficient of the sand or rocks it's walking on, it simply keeps a close eye on itself.""We do not learn about sand, we learn about feet sinking,"" said co-author Ashish Kumar, also from Berkeley.Ultimately the system ends up having two parts: a main, always-running algorithm actually controlling the robot's gait, and an adaptive algorithm running in parallel that monitors changes to the robot's internal readings. When significant changes are detected, it analyzes them — the legs should be doing this, but they're doing this, which means the situation is like this — and tells the main model how to adjust itself. From then on the robot only thinks in terms of how to move forward under these new conditions, effectively improvising a specialized gait.Image Credits: Berkeley AI Research, Facebook AI Research and CMUAfter training in simulation, it succeeded handsomely in the real world, as the news release describes it:The robot was able to walk on sand, mud, hiking trails, tall grass and a dirt pile without a single failure in all our trials. The robot successfully walked down stairs along a hiking trail in 70% of the trials. It successfully navigated a cement pile and a pile of pebbles in 80% of the trials despite never seeing the unstable or sinking ground, obstructive vegetation or stairs during training. It also maintained its height with a high success rate when moving with a 12kg payload that amounted to 100% of its body weight. or (very briefly) in the gif above.Malik gave a nod to the research of , whose work has shown how adaptable and freeform the human process of learning how to walk is. The team's instinct was that if you want a robot that can handle any situation, it has to learn adaptation from scratch, not have a variety of modes to choose from.Just as you can't build a smarter computer vision system by exhaustively labeling and documenting every object and interaction (there will always be more), you can't prepare a robot for a diverse and complex physical world with 10, 100, even thousands of special parameters for walking on gravel, mud, rubble, wet wood, etc. For that matter you may not even want to specify anything at all beyond the general idea of forward motion.""We don't pre-program the idea that it has for legs, or anything about the morphology of the robot,"" said Kumar.This means the basis of the system — not the fully trained one, which ultimately did mold itself to quadrupedal gaits — can potentially be applied not just to other legged robots, but entirely different domains of AI and robotics.""The legs of a robot are similar to the fingers of a hand; the way that legs interact with environments, fingers interact with objects,"" noted co-author Deepak Pathak, of Carnegie Mellon University. ""The basic idea can be applied to any robot.""Even further, Malik suggested, the pairing of basic and adaptive algorithms could work for other intelligent systems. Smart homes and municipal systems tend to rely on preexisting policies, but what if they adapted on the fly instead?For now the team is simply presenting their initial findings in a paper at the  conference and acknowledge that there is a great deal of follow-up research to do. For instance building an internal library of the improvised gaits as a sort of ""medium term"" memory, or using vision to predict the necessity of initiating a new style of locomotion. But the RMA approach seems to be a promising new approach for an enduring challenge in robotics.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"Scientists learn how otters stay hotter - Yahoo Singapore News
Sea otters are a hardy lot.The smallest of all marine mammals with the thickest fur of the animal kingdom, they can hold their breath for up to eight minutes while they dive for prey like clams and crabs, which they're known to crack open using rocks.An enduring mystery, however, was just how the mustelids manage to stay warm in the chilly waters of their Pacific habitat, bereft of the blubber that insulates seals, whales and walruses.The answer, according to a new paper published in the journal Science on Thursday, is a unique energy conversion system whereby their muscle tissue ""leak"" large amounts of heat throughout their bodies.That's unlike other mammals, which have to put their muscles to work through exercise, or involuntary shivering, to achieve the same result.Lead author Traver Wright of Texas A&M University told AFP that while sea otters' dense, water-resistant fur offsets some heat loss, it isn't enough by itself to cope with the frigid waters off Alaska, where most of them reside.Scientists already knew the sea otters burn a lot of energy -- approximately three times greater than predicted for mammals of their size, and to keep up with the demand, they may consume up to 25 percent of their body mass in a day.It was unclear, though, which tissues were making use of this energy and how it was going towards producing heat.To find out, Wright and colleagues took muscle samples from sea otters that were already dead, or, more happily, had been rehabilitated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and were being prepared for release.They then used a device to measure oxygen consumption.- 'Making heat by being inefficient' -The main function of muscles is generally to be able to move the body, but in the otters, much of the metabolic energy produced by breaking down sugars and fats was lost as heat instead of being used by mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, to do work such as powering muscle contraction.This effect had been predicted for polar animals, but was observed for the first time in sea otters in the new paper.""One of the interesting things that we found is that they're really good at making heat by being inefficient,"" said Wright.What the team observed would be considered wasteful in land mammals like humans, ""but if you're an animal that's trying to warm up, then that 'wasted' energy and heat is a good thing.""In other words, ideal for helping maintain a body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in freezing conditions.The team found that this ""thermogenesic"" effect was present in sea otters from the time they were babies to adults, and there was no difference in captive and wild-raised animals.Sea otters and marine mammals more broadly might have evolved such traits when their terrestrial ancestors began taking to the oceans 50 million years ago, but that hypothesis will require more research to confirm.Learning how sea otters' metabolic system functions differently from ours could one day also help humans solve obesity issues, added Wright.""If you can figure out how to increase the leak and metabolic rate, you could theoretically have humans revving up the metabolism and burning off additional calories.""ia/mdl",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JxJoWYmt5sCdy1lvEZuhTA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0My43NQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Hw1.Z4Yv1_mLySoAy3ZDRA--~B/aD01MTU7dz03Njg7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.com.sg/9a2ac8a403ce2af18546182986c431fa,"Longest known continuous record of the Paleozoic discovered in Yukon wilderness - Phys.org
Hundreds of millions of years ago, in the middle of what would eventually become Canada's Yukon Territory, an ocean swirled with armored trilobites, clam-like brachiopods and soft, squishy creatures akin to slugs and squid.

                                         
                                                  





A trove of fossils and rock layers formed on that ancient ocean floor have now been unearthed by an international team of scientists along the banks of the Peel River a few hundred miles south of the Arctic's Beaufort Sea. The discovery reveals oxygen changes at the seafloor across nearly 120 million years of the early Paleozoic era, a time that fostered the most rapid development and diversification of complex, multi-cellular life in Earth's history.
""It's unheard of to have that much of Earth's history in one place,"" said Stanford University geological scientist Erik Sperling, lead author of a July 7 study detailing the team's findings in Science Advances. Most rock formations from the Paleozoic Era have been broken up by tectonic forces or eroded over time. ""There's nowhere else in the world that I know of where you can study that long a record of Earth history, where there's basically no change in things like water depth or basin type.""
Oxygen was scarce in the deep water of this and other oceans at the dawn of the Paleozoic, roughly 541 million years ago. It stayed scarce until the Devonian, roughly 405 million years ago, when, in a geological blink—no more than a few million years—oxygen likely rocketed to levels close to those in modern oceans and the diversity of life on Earth exploded. Big, predatory fish appeared. Primitive ferns and conifers marched across continents previously ruled by bacteria and algae. Dragonflies took flight. And all of this after nearly four billion years of Earth's landscapes being virtually barren.
Scientists have long debated what might have caused the dramatic shift from a low oxygen world to a more oxygenated one that could support a diverse web of animal life. But until now, it has been difficult to pin down the timing of global oxygenation or the long-term, background state of the world's oceans and atmosphere during the era that witnessed both the so-called Cambrian explosion of life and the first of Earth's ""Big Five"" mass extinctions, about 445 million years ago at the end of the Ordovician.






""In order to make comparisons throughout these huge swaths of our history and understand long-term trends, you need a continuous record,"" said Sperling, an assistant professor of geological sciences at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences (Stanford Earth).
Context for past life
With permission from the Na Cho Nyak Dun and Tetlit Gwitch'in communities in Yukon, Sperling's team, which included researchers from Dartmouth College and the Yukon Geological Survey, spent three summers at the Peel River site. Arriving by helicopter, the research team hacked through brush with machetes beside Class VI rapids to collect hundreds of fist-sized samples of rock from more than a mile of interbedded layers of shale, chert and lime mudstone.
Back at Sperling's lab at Stanford, a small army of summer undergraduates and graduate students worked over five summers to help analyze the fossils and chemicals entombed in the rocks. ""We spent a lot of time splitting open rocks and looking at graptolite fossils,"" Sperling said. Because graptolites evolved a vast array of recognizable body shapes relatively quickly, the pencil-like markings left by the fossils of these colony-dwelling sea creatures give geologists a way to date the rocks in which they're found.
Once the researchers had finished identifying and dating graptolite fossils, they ground the rocks in a mill, then measured iron, carbon, phosphorous and other elements in the resulting powder to assess the ocean conditions at the time and place where the layers formed. They analyzed 837 new samples from the Peel River site, as well as 106 new samples from other parts of Canada and 178 samples from around the world for comparison.
Winners and losers
The data show low oxygen levels, or anoxia, likely persisted in the world's oceans for millions of years longer than previously thought—well into the Phanerozoic, when land plants and early animals began to diversify. ""The early animals were still living in a low oxygen world,"" Sperling said. Contrary to long-held assumptions, the scientists found Paleozoic oceans were also surprisingly free of hydrogen sulfide, a respiratory toxin often found in the anoxic regions of modern oceans.
When oxygen eventually did tick upward in marine environments, it came about just as larger, more complex plant life took off. ""There's a ton of debate about how plants impacted the Earth system,"" Sperling said. ""Our results are consistent with a hypothesis that as plants evolved and covered the Earth, they increased nutrients to the ocean, driving oxygenation."" In this hypothesis, the influx of nutrients to the sea would have given a boost to primary productivity, a measure of how quickly plants and algae take carbon dioxide and sunlight, turn them into new biomass—and release oxygen in the process.
The change probably killed off graptolites. ""Although more oxygen is really good for a lot of organisms, graptolites lost the low oxygen habitat that was their refuge,"" Sperling said. ""Any environmental change is going to have winners and losers. Graptolites might have been the losers.""

A study published this week in the scientific journal Frontiers in Marine Science found that opening the 3.14 million acre Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument to commercial fishing reduces species protection in the richly diverse and vital ecological area.

                                         
                                                  





The study used the Atlantic Ocean marine conservation area to explore the consequences of changing a policy that prevents fishing to a fisheries management policy.
""The idea for this study was generated when former President Trump stated that appropriately managed commercial fishing would not put the objects of scientific and historic interest that the monument protects at risk. To explore this idea, the study brought together scientists with a broad range of expertise: fisheries management, ocean policy, and the ecology of species ranging from marine mammals to deep sea corals,"" says Jessica V. Redfern, a senior scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium and the study's lead author.
Peter Auster, UConn Research Professor Emeritus of Marine Sciences and Senior Research Scientist at Mystic Aquarium, and co-author, says the study was a great opportunity to fill some crucial knowledge gaps.
""We have gaps in our understanding and as we see, with greater and greater and greater clarity, there should be an emphasis on figuring out what we have and how to conserve it while we still want to get goods and services out of the oceans without jeopardizing it,"" Auster says. ""We need to expend more resources farther offshore to increase our knowledge—and wisdom—as we make policy and management decisions about exploiting ocean wildlife. For instance, how do we simultaneously conserve biological diversity and exploit natural resources? How do we balance using some  places for direct economic and human benefit while protecting other areas to serve as reference sites to understand human impacts and ensure these natural resources are here for future generations?""
Contrary to the former president's statement, the study found that opening the monument is not without risk.
""We found that opening the monument to commercial fishing reduces species protection,"" the authors write in the report, adding that fixed gear fishing equipment exposes species to entanglement and bycatch risk and gear used at the bottom of the ocean exposes deep sea coral communities to damaging effects. The monument ""was designated as a marine national monument due to the area's unique ecological resources that are a subject of scientific interest. Our case study demonstrates that a fisheries management policy is insufficient to protect these ecological resources,"" they concluded.
The monument, located 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod, is a majestic deep-water sanctuary for thousands of marine animals and sea birds amid colorful corals, steep canyons, and vast mountain ranges akin to those in national parks out West.
In 2016, after years of research, scientists from UConn, Mystic Aquarium, and New England Aquarium provided crucial evidence about the area's rich biodiversity, leading President Obama to designate it a national marine protected area. His proclamation excluded all commercial-scale activities, including fishing and mineral extraction, with a seven-year moratorium for existing offshore lobster and red crab fisheries. President Trump lifted restrictions on commercial fishing in June 2020, opening large sections of the monument to fishing again. The Biden-Harris Administration is considering restoring protections as part of their plan to conserve 30 percent of US lands and waters by 2030.
""One of today's greatest conservation challenges is applying our many natural resource laws, policies, and management strategies to accommodate a diversity of ocean uses and human needs,"" says Auster. ""We need to address both sustainable use of economically valuable ocean resources and conserve precious marine biodiversity, our collective natural heritage.""

The pandemic and its consequences have led to all of us spending more time in front of screens. Whether it is adults or children, the risks of vision problems have increased. That's why Highlab has created Eyes Keeper, an application to protect your eyes from screens.Highlab, a French studio specialized in the design and production of digital devices, has rolled out its Eyes Keeper tool to allow parents to better control their children's environment. Eyes Keeper forces the device user to maintain a suitable distance when looking at a screen thanks to a detection system. If the user does not respect the necessary distance, the application will blur the image until there's a reasonable minimum of space between the user and the smartphone or tablet. Early, excessive exposure to screens Spending too much time looking at screens is harmful for the eyes. Accumulated screentime can cause visual fatigue, dry eyes or even promote the development of myopia. These are among the reasons why massive use of screens and the increasing number of devices piling up in our homes has long worried the health world. For many users, screentime has gotten out of hand and our relationship to our devices is one of addiction, causing sleep deficits, anxiety, attention disorders, memory problems and more.Doctors call this new syndrome EEES for ""early and excessive exposure to screens."" The creators of Eyes Keeper want to help device users create better defenses against these issues, allowing parents for example to choose which applications can be used according to a certain time slot. The aim is to ultimately help families avoid these increasingly frequent vision problems.The application is available on the Google Store, priced at €3.99.Axel Barre",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eexo.TsodGJazctHJ2Gjhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY3Mi42MjkyNzg5NTEyMDE3/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/80jQBIUoVAs.LgNdgg1U.A--~B/aD0xOTI0O3c9Mjc0NjthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/afprelaxnews.com/15cb44f5788c3f849ec18411010e08d2,"Redesigned Microsoft Office for Windows is now available for Insiders - Techradar
While Microsoft is trying to fix the compatibility issues on the newly announced Windows 11, the company is also looking to introduce a new user interface for its Office applications.Though the fresh look was supposed to launch last week, the Redmond based tech company has announced that the Beta version of the updated interface is now available for insiders to download on both Windows 11 and Windows 10.According to the official blog post by Microsoft, the new Microsoft Office carries the same fluent design language that we’ve come across on Windows 11. The company states that it has been working on the redesign since 2017.Microsoft is promising a simple, natural and consistent design experience with all your Windows apps  This MS Office update will bring the refreshed look seen in Windows 11 to applications like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, Access, Project, Publisher, and Visio.Additionally, users who like customizing the look and theming on their systems will be able to set the separate theme for Windows and Office apps. This can be done by choosing the theme of your choice from the Office Account tab under the file menu. In case you want to have matching themes on both Office and Windows 11 for a consistent experience, you can select “Use system settings.”While Microsoft wanted to do away with the ribbon bar in favour of a command bar, however, the ribbon bar retains its place in this update. Also, while the current update majorly has design tweaks, the company promises more tweaks in the weeks and months leading to the final release.Want to know about the latest happenings in tech? Follow TechRadar India on Twitter, Facebook and InstagramJitendra has been working in the Internet Industry for the last 7 years now and has written about a wide range of topics including gadgets, smartphones, reviews, games, software, apps, deep tech, AI, and consumer electronics.  Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

Samsung Mini LED TVs are 11% more efficient - TechRadar
New Samsung TVs with Mini LED backlights could be as much as 11.6% more efficient than your current TV.That's what Samsung is claiming for its 2021 range of Neo QLED screens, all of which pack in enhanced backlights with greater energy efficiency than previous Samsung screens.Mini LED technology makes use of light-emitting diodes that are 1/40th of the sizes of traditional LEDs, allowing for far more precise brightness control. This means that the overall brightness of the screen can be lower, without lighting up pixels that don't need the extra visibility. Samsung claims that energy consumption is reduced by ""about a quarter"" (so, 25%) through a combination of improved backlights and optimized power supply boards too – while the slim nature of Mini LEDs means that its screens are even more compact and resource-light than before. Samsung also introduced a new solar-powered TV remote for its 2021 QLED range, doing away with disposable batteries for good.Of course, we wouldn't necessarily advise you to chuck your current television to get this more efficient one right away. Throwing away a TV can be damaging to the environment in itself, if not properly recycled, and it can cause waste to make upgrades before an older model has really run its course.But if you need to upgrade your old LCD, and are looking for a model that won't take such a toll on your energy bills, a Neo QLED / Mini LED model should certainly fare better. The only other thing to consider is whether an OLED might be better...TV makers are increasingly laying out their green credentials these days, and in a consumer tech market prone to wastage, a move towards sustainable practices can't come soon enough.LG has laid out some attractive figures for OLED TV recycling, showing that OLED panels for 65-inch TVs require a mere 0.43kg of plastic, compared to the 5.2kg of plastic utilized in a 65-inch LCD. That's 12 times as much plastic in an LCD screen – and it's not plastic that's easily recyclable, either, given the complexity of the material (via Business Korea).OLED TVs fare much better when it comes to power usage too. Due to the self-emissive nature of OLED panels, they don't require the backlight systems of LCD and QLED screens, and use a fraction of the amount of energy.In 2017, SGS also praised LG's reduction of ""hazardous substances"" in OLED TV manufacturing compared to LCD, as well as the ability of a ""self-luminous display [...] that used less parts and attained greater resource efficiency and recycle rates.""Samsung made some noise in 2020 around 'Eco-packaging' for select new Samsung TVs, made from ""eco-friendly corrugated cardboard"" that can be repurposed into a pet kennel or magazine rack, alongside moves to replace metal staples with glue and utilise more recycled plastic in its packaging. However, the aggregate wastage of plastic-heavy LCD TVs may be more than these green measures can counteract by themselves.As Home Cinema Editor, Henry lives and breathes televisions, which is bad for the lungs but great for his content addiction.

Remembering what was said in a Microsoft Teams meeting has become a lot easier since Microsoft released its auto record feature last month but recording multiple meetings per day can take up a lot of storage.This is why in a new update to the Microsoft 365 roadmap, the software giant has revealed that it's currently working on a new feature that will prevent recorded Teams meetings from using up all of your cloud storage capacity.It's worth noting that not all meetings in Microsoft's  are recorded automatically as this feature needs to be set up using an administrative policy according to a support document. This is because auto recording was added to Teams for organizations that need to capture meeting interactions in order to comply with industry regulations or local laws.In its latest update to the Microsoft 365 roadmap, Microsoft revealed that it's developing a new feature that will allow Teams admins to set meeting recordings store on OneDrive and SharePoint to expire automatically.Once this feature rolls out in September, a default Teams policy setting will automatically delete meeting recordings stored in either OneDrive or SharePoint after a set amount of time. However, Teams admins will be able to modify the default meeting recording expiration time through a setting in the Teams Admin Portal or by modifying policy attributes using Powershell scripts.Going forward, meeting recordings will be automatically deleted once they reach their expiration date unless the meeting owner decides to push it back. Meeting owners won't have to worry about losing meeting recordings as well as Microsoft will notify them before a recording expires.High resolution video recordings of meetings can take up a lot of space in an organization's cloud storage but thanks to this new feature, companies will be able to save their recently recorded meetings without getting bogged down by having too many recordings of older meetings saved online.After living and working in South Korea for seven years, Anthony now resides in Houston, Texas where he writes about a variety of technology topics for ITProPortal and TechRadar.

"Man arrested for armed robbery at Bukit Batok licensed moneylender involving $22000 - The Straits Times
SINGAPORE - A man was arrested on Friday morning (July 9) for his suspected involvement in a case of armed robbery, just 11 hours after the heist.The 30-year-old Singaporean allegedly went to a licensed moneylender along Bukit Batok Street 31 at about 7pm on Thursday and showed a woman working there a handwritten note.Two notes that were later seized by the police were shown to the media.The first note read: ""Don't panic. Don't shout. This is a robbery. Fill up the bag with money. You have two minutes. Or else!""The second note read: ""This is a robbery. Don't shout. Don't panic. Put all the money in the bag and nobody will get hurt.""

SINGAPORE: A 41-year-old man targeted a teenager and a boy on separate occasions, molesting one on a train and asking the second a lewd question while out on bail for the first offence.Chew Yeow Keong was given 17 weeks' jail on Friday (Jul 9) for his crimes. He pleaded guilty to a charge each of molesting an 18-year-old teen on a train and insulting the modesty of a 12-year-old boy. A third charge was considered in sentencing.The court heard that Chew was in a train on Aug 12, 2019, when an 18-year-old teenager got on at Lorong Chuan MRT station.Chew winked at the 18-year-old, but the teenager ignored him. The train was not crowded but Chew stood up and approached the teenager.He stood beside the teenager and stretched out his hand, molesting the teen's buttock.The teenager was shocked and turned to see an arm being retracted near his buttock. He quickly alighted at the next stop and lodged a police report the next day.While police investigations were ongoing and he was out on bail, Chew committed another offence.At about 9.15pm on Mar 10 this year, a 12-year-old boy was heading home after playing football at Our Tampines Hub when Chew approached him.Chew asked if he could perform a sex act on the boy. The boy stared at Chew before walking away quickly. When he realised Chew was still looking at him, the boy ran home and told his mother what happened.His mother called the police, saying her son was still shaken by what happened. Chew was subsequently remanded. The prosecutor asked for at least 15 to 20 weeks' jail and a fine, citing Chew's previous convictions including two counts of molestation in 2002 and another four in 2016. The degree of sexual exploitation on the older victim was on the lower end and the touch was not prolonged, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Joseph Gwee.While no physical contact was made with the younger victim, Mr Gwee said this offence was committed while Chew was on bail and under police investigations.Defence lawyer S S Dhillon asked for 15 weeks' jail, saying his client is remorseful and has pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.""He has asked me to convey to the court that he will never repeat this mistake again,"" he said.
