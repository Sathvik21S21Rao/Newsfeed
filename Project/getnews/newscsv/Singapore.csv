"“Only Mohamed Salah” — Stats, Facts, And Records Broken During Liverpool’s Drubbing Of Manchester United - The Liverpool Offside
Liverpool are seemingly breaking records on a weekly basis these days, both individually for players and the manager, as well as for the club itself. It’s even more impressive when you think about how the Reds put themselves in the position to do so.Liverpool are in the enviable position of having one of the greatest managers and motivators of all time in conjunction with having a strong and settled side. It’s rare these days to see the core of a team stay together this long, and we have the pleasure of seeing the results bear out as history is made in real time. Let’s take a few moments to delve into some of the fun stats, facts, and records broken as Liverpool humiliated Manchester United at the weekend.“Only Mo Salah...”It’s a running joke these days that seemingly every stat relating to another player begins with “Only Mo Salah” has more or better of whatever stay is being counted. Well, the Egyptian King has yet again put himself at the top of another statistical category. With his hat trick, he surpassed Didier Drogba for the most goals by an African in the Premier League. What’s even more impressive is that Salah reached the mark in 89 fewer games than Drogba.Salah also became the first player to EVER score a Premier League hat trick at Old Trafford. He’s only the second Liverpool player ever to net three in a game there in all competitions. Salah also became the first Liverpool players to score three games in a row at Old Trafford, or as we now call it, Anfield East.Mo is on scorching form, and has scored in 10 games straight. He now has more goals himself in the Premier League than the following teams: Spurs (9), Brighton (9), Wolves (9), Southampton (8), Leeds (8), Burnley (7), and Norwich (2).In all competitions, Salah now has 15 goals and 5 assists in 1051 minutes. For those counting, that's a goal or assist every 52.6 minutes. It seems safe to say it, but I’ll let Trent do the talking for me:The best in the world ✋ @MoSalah He’s Boss, thaMo Salah isn't the only one that made history against Manchester United. With the win over Liverpool’s domestic rivals, Jürgen Klopp became the fastest Liverpool manager to reach 200 wins at the club. He reached the mark in just 331 matches, having a win rate of just over 60%. He got to 200 wins in 2 fewer games than Sir Kenny Dalglish, 19 fewer than Bob Paisley, and in 51 fewer than Bill Shankly. Talk about heady company.As Jürgen Klopp has recorded 200 wins faster than any previous #LFC manager, here's a little thread on a breakdown of the victories #Klopp200 Red Hot RedsWhile individual records are great, it’s a whole lot more fun when they are being broken as part of a sensational winning team. To that end, Liverpool have now extended their unbeaten streak in all competitions to 22 games.During that unbeaten streak, Liverpool have scored goals by the bucket load. The team has blitzed teams away from Anfield, scoring 3 or more goals in all 8 away matches this season. After winning 5-0 against both Watford and Manchester United, Klopp’s team became just the second in club history that won back to back league games by five or more goals, and the first to do it without conceding in either game.Don’t forget to tune in for next week’s edition of “Only Mo Salah” and other fun facts!",https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dp6FtaxAcGhK4CGP76uA-_buYQs=/0x0:3088x2104/1200x800/filters:focal(1724x262:2218x756)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70045275/1348590695.0.jpg,"Controversial FSG and Liverpool decision justified, as Manchester United comprehensive proof - Liverpool.com
Imagine winning 5-0 away from home against your biggest rivals and Sadio Mané still sitting on the bench with 15 minutes to go. Jürgen Klopp had that rare luxury against Manchester United at the weekend in what was a fruitful afternoon for Liverpool.But Mané's substitution did not only rub salt in the wounds of United's defeat, it also illustrated why Liverpool were right to steer away from a volatile market in the summer transfer window. Over the summer, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was lauded for his activity in the market, and United were seen as genuine Premier League title contenders.Liverpool, meanwhile, were overlooked; their squad seen by many as weak in comparison to their rivals. Yet over the weekend, it was Liverpool's squad that came out victorious and then some.United could boast an almost full strength squad apart from Raphaël Varane.Meanwhile, the Reds were missing Fabinho, Thiago Alcântara and James Milner was also forced off the pitch after half an hour. Klopp also gave rest to Joël Matip and Sadio Mané who would normally be part of Liverpool's strongest XI. Despite the rotated squad, United could not compete against Liverpool as the Reds ran rampant and obliterated their opponents. Solskjaer's hefty new signings were non-existent, with Ronaldo pocketed by Ibrahima Konaté and Jadon Sancho not even deemed worthy enough to feature. Much was made about Liverpool's lack of depth this season, but after a few months in, only Jürgen Klopp's side remain unbeaten in all competitions against their Premier League counterparts who have already faced domestic and continental defeats. Injuries have not been kind to Liverpool either. Trent Alexander-Arnold has faced time on the sideline. Roberto Firmino had an injury and Liverpool have had to play their last two games without Fabinho, not to mention the extended absence of Thiago and Elliott who have already missed eight and nine games respectively. Yet in every circumstance so far, Liverpool have prevailed. When Alexander-Arnold was missing, James Milner stepped into cover and did enough even against Manchester City's Phil Foden for the Reds to avoid defeat. Henderson has stepped up in Fabinho's absence. Meanwhile, Curtis Jones has alleviated the absence of Thiago and Elliott putting in scintillating displays. They have all served to prove an important point that was often mooted during the transfer window over the summer — Liverpool's squad has adequate depth.Sure, there are a few cosmetic adjustments that could make the Reds even stronger.But any new signing, even in midfield, would have been a luxury considering the club has seven central midfielders — not including Roberto Firmino or Takumi Minamino, who could both also play in midfield if necessary.United are proof you cannot make signings for signing's sake. They have to make sense and they have to be the right fit. Other than Ibrahima Konaté, there were not many players who were available for Liverpool this summer that would have fitted the club's profile. The Reds will invest when the right players present themselves in the market. Liverpool's continued success is proof FSG's decisions are justified and fans have nothing to worry about.

SINGAPORE - Ahead of Timor-Leste's clash with Singapore at the Under-23 Asian Cup qualifiers, forward Paulo Gali - who had been in the centre of an age-fraud storm - However, speedy and tricky as he might be, he just could not run away from the drama at Jalan Besar on Monday (Oct 25) as the game ended 2-2, but not before he was sent packing.In the 42nd minute, the 16-year-old put his team 2-1 up following a poor throw-in from the Young Lions in the Timor-Leste half.Gali, who had been embroiled in controversy owing to the 2018 AFF Suzuki Cup website listing him as a 22-year-old, celebrated wildly as he thumped his chest and pumped his fist in the direction of the Singapore fans among the 953-strong crowd who had been heckling him during the match.After a couple of minutes, fourth official Hussein Abo Yehia was seen talking to referee Majed Al Shamrani, who flashed the red card to Gali's disbelief.Post-match, Timor-Leste coach Fabio da Silva said: ""He did nothing wrong. If he did, I would be the first to tell him he deserved the red card.""Overall, I’m very happy with the result and I expected this because we know what we can deliver on the field. If we had 11 men, we could have an even better performance.”Gali felt aggrieved by the referee's decision, saying: ""I didn't show bad attitude or say any bad words to the Singapore fans. I truly respect them not just as a opponent during this game but also as a fellow Asean country.""I've seen many professional players showing their emotion after scoring and there were no cards given to them.""Midfielder Filomeno added: “With 10 men, we had to work harder to defend and control the ball. It was difficult, like playing two games, but we got a good result.”Indeed, the hosts could not find a way to win despite a numerical and fitness advantage - Timor-Leste frequently went down with cramps in the second half and used all five substitutes by the 73rd minute - and required a late equaliser by Jordan Emaviwe to avoid defeat against the Asean minnows.Earlier in the game, forward Glenn Kweh had given Nazri Nasir's side the lead after 34 minutes when he instinctively swept in Joel Chew's corner that was parried into his path by the goalkeeper.The lead lasted only five minutes as Timor-Leste equalised from a corner themselves as Gali's cross went through to Elias Mesquita, who slotted in at the back post, before turning provider for the second goal.Despite enterprising play from Kweh and Chew, the Young Lions could not create many clear opportunities, with Junildo Pereira saving from Farhan Zulkifli and Chew seeing a shot cleared off the line.In the last minute of added time, centre-back Emaviwe lashed in from a pass by Chew to save his team's blushes.Nazri said: ""I'm proud of our players who gave 100 per cent and didn't give up. Our players executed our game plan, built from the back and applied high pressure. We created many chances, but just couldn't score.""The boys will learn from such international exposure after not playing at this level for two years because of the pandemic.""Moving forward, we will need to improve on winning more second balls. We have two more games and we will focus on how we can beat the Philippines first.""Only the top teams and four best runners-up from the 11 groups will make it to the tournament proper in Uzbekistan next year.In the earlier game, South Korea beat Philippines 3-0 with three second-half goals to top the group.",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/article_pictrure_780x520_/public/articles/2021/10/25/mi_sgsoccer_251021.jpg?itok=xgC4Lkeu&timestamp=1635173051,"Dota 2 post-TI10 roster shuffle: Alliance part ways with s4 - Yahoo Singapore News
The competitive Dota 2 scene's post-The International 10 (TI10) roster shuffle continue as Alliance announced on Monday (25 October) that team captain and offlaner Gustav ""s4"" Magnusson has parted ways with the team.With s4's departure, Alliance's Dota 2 roster is now down to just star carry player Nikolay ""Nikobaby"" Nikolov and position 4 support Simon ""Handsken"" Haag after  last Thursday (21 October).Alliance will be looking to revamp its roster after they followed up a dominant showing in the 2021 Dota Pro Circuit (DPC) regular seasons with lacklustre performances in the Majors and at TI10.Alliance finished second and first in the two seasons of the upper division of the DPC's Western European regional league. However, the team only managed to finish 13th in the ONE Esports Singapore Major in April and 9th-12th in the WePlay AniMajor in June. In TI10, Alliance barely managed to qualify for the Main Event with a 4-12 record in the Group Stage before getting knocked out of the tournament by T1 in the second round of the lower bracket.""S4 is a legend not only to Alliance but in the Dota scene and his return to the organisation played a massive part in helping the team qualify for The International 10. Despite many challenges, S4 delivered in his captain role from the offlane. While being an unconventional position for a captain the DPC seasons with Alliance were a massive success finishing second and first place respectively over the two seasons,"" Alliance chief strategy officer Kelly Ong said in a statement.“It’s always sad to say goodbye to a friend. Especially a friend as special and important to Alliance’s history as the son of Magnus himself, S4. We all wanted more from this TI but that doesn’t mean we didn’t give it our all this year. Because we did. Everyone that reaches this prestigious event does,"" added Alliance CEO and co-founder Jonathan “Loda” Berg.S4 was instrumental in Alliance's run to becoming the champions in TI3 in the organisation's first year of existence as the team's midlaner. He left the team for the first time in September 2014, a year after their win at TI3, before returning for a second stint from 2015 to 2016. S4's third and most recent stint with Alliance began in April last year.The post-TI10 roster shuffleThe competitive Dota 2 scene revolves around TI, Dota 2's yearly world championship tournament that has regularly broken the record for the biggest prize pool for a single esports event year after year. TI10 featured a US$40 million prize pool, with .The yearly post-TI roster shuffles came as a result of the importance of TI to the game's competitive scene, with teams that either failed to qualify or placed poorly in the tournament often revamping their rosters in preparation for another run at the Aegis of Champions.TI's importance in the scene has even manifested itself in how contracts between players and their organisations are structured, with most contracts ending with the conclusion of TI. This arrangement has allowed both teams and players to explore their options and better prepare for the next iteration of the DPC and TI.The next DPC is expected to start in December, though Dota 2 developer Valve Software has yet to officially announce its schedule. This year's post-TI shuffle, as a result, is also expected to take place from October until November as rosters become locked shortly before the DPC begins.For more esports news updates, visit  and check out Yahoo Esports Southeast Asia’s Facebook page and Twitter.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/in0oH5SbsVY1H6qaSShxzg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9c6b4710-351e-11ec-b7fb-41ec9930cc16,"DAMWON, Gen.G sweep their way to LoL Worlds 2021 semi-finals - Yahoo Singapore News
South Korea continues its dominance at the 2021 League of Legends World Championship (Worlds) Playoffs after defending champions DAMWON Gaming KIA (DWG KIA) and Gen.G Esports swept aside Europe's MAD Lions and North America's Cloud9 (C9) respectively to advance to the semi-finals.Defending champions DWG KIA are inching closer to a second-straight title after they stomped MAD Lions in a 3-0 sweep on Sunday (24 October). The South Korean giants looked unstoppable and have racked up a streak of nine-straight wins thus far. MVP Kim ""Canyon"" Geon-bu's excellent jungler skills shone in their latest show of force over MAD Lions, racking up 14 kills and 31 assists against just four deaths in the series.DWG KIA refined their vaunted bot lane strategy in the first game, averting a repeat of their 2021 Mid-Season Invitational losses to MAD Lions. The South Korean champs also put on a midgame masterclass as they meticulously covered all their bases, taking away the enemy's vision and preventing any comebacks, en route to a 29-minute victory in the series opener.MAD Lions did not go down without a fight in game two, shutting down both Kim ""Khan"" Dong-ha and Heo ""ShowMaker"" Su in the early game. But while the Europeans took most of the objectives and dominated most of the early fights, DWG KIA patiently prepared for a comeback in the late game.In the fight for the Baron, Khan turned things around, grabbing an opportunity for a flank through Kennen's ultimate to set up an Ace for his team. Then, with all of their champions outscaling their counterparts, DWG KIA completed their 36-minute comeback win and took a commanding 2-0 series lead.Game three still kept everyone at the edge of their seats as MAD Lions tried to find wins on the side lanes, with a flank from İrfan Berk ""Armut"" Tükek keeping the Europeans in the fight. However, DWG KIA showed their ability to adjust their playstyle on the fly, as they aced the last hope of Europe over and over to secure the 3-0 series sweep and a spot in the semi-finals after 39 minutes of action.Gen.G Esports also triumphed in a 3-0 sweep against Cloud9 in this year's last quarterfinals match on Monday (25 October). While the South Korean team had been previously criticised for their risk-averse meta and predictable champion pool, they still proved to be the better team against an aggressive C9. Gen.G jungler Kim ""Clid"" Tae-min fuelled his team's dominance with his keen game sense and well-timed smites, earning him the match MVP award.Gen.G was forced off their comfort zone in game one through targeted champion bans and counterpicks from C9. But despite the limitations, the South Koreans stuck to what they do best; steadily sweeping map objectives and punishing hasty plays from C9. Gen.G's measured play eventually allowed them to claim the opening game in just under 42 minutes.Game two saw Clid snuff out all threats to Gen.G with his effective map rotations. First, he denied the top lane Ibrahim ""Fudge"" Allami's Malphite from growing before assisting the mid lane with ganks on C9 star player Luka ""Perkz"" Perković. Finally, the Gen.G jungler sniped C9's Jesper ""Zven"" Svenningsen during a crucial team fight, helping his team eliminate all enemies and secure the Baron before finishing the game in just 25 minutes.At the start of the third game, the South Koreans found themselves in a bind, as C9's vision and map control allowed them to seize Gen. G's camps. However, Gwak ""Bdd"" Bo-seong landed Zoe's bubbles expertly in a fight for the Mountain Drake, eliminating the opposition in a critical juncture. Clid then sealed the gold gap after taking out Zven again and forcing a 4v5 with C9 in the mid lane to get the Baron. Gen.G then seized this opportunity to destroy mid lane turrets and eventually demolish the enemy Nexus after 34 minutes, thus securing themselves a spot in the semifinals.The 2021 Worlds semi-finals will commence on 30 October, starting with a clash between defending champs DWG KIA and T1, led by the legendary Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok. Meanwhile, Gen.G will be matched against China's EDward Gaming (EDG) on 31 October. The winners of those two matches will then face off in the grand finals on 6 November for the coveted Summoner's Cup and the title of 2021 LoL worlds champions.For more esports news updates, visit  and check out Yahoo Esports Southeast Asia’s Facebook page and Twitter.Watch more videos on Yahoo",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/h1w5RsX0KemzDU9G.zqWag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d3c3d270-35ed-11ec-b7bb-4202192ef177
"No vax, no hire: Employers can assume those who refuse to disclose Covid-19 vaccination status to be unvaccinated - AsiaOne
Employees who refuse to disclose their Covid-19 vaccination status can be treated as unvaccinated, and companies can terminate workers who do not comply with their workforce vaccination measures as a last resort, according to an advisory by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).Employers can also impose a vaccination requirement upfront when hiring new staff for the purpose of planning deployment at the workplace, MOM said in response to a set of frequently asked questions on its website.These workforce vaccination measures are applicable to anyone working at the same premises as their employees, including independent contractors and vendors, it saidEmployers can also request staff to show their vaccination status through their TraceTogether app and token, HealthHub app or the original physical vaccination card.This is an update from an earlier position taken by MOM and its tripartite partners - the National Trades Union Congress and the Singapore National Employers Federation.In its latest advisory on Covid-19 vaccination at the workplace, MOM said for work that can be performed at home, employers may allow unvaccinated workers to work remotely at their prerogative.However, it added: ""As the vast majority of vaccinated employees eventually return to the workplace more frequently, the prolonged absence of the unvaccinated employees from the workplace may affect their individual performance as well as negatively impact team or organisational performance.""[[nid:549750]]As for work that cannot be performed at home, MOM said employers can allow them to continue in their existing job with pre-event testing done at the employees' own expense, or such staff may be redeployed to suitable jobs that can be done from home.As a last resort, however, they may be placed on no-pay leave or terminated with notice in accordance with their employment contract.""If termination of employment is due to employees' inability to be at the workplace to perform their contracted work, such termination of employment would not be considered as wrongful dismissal,"" MOM said.The tripartite partners have also urged the remaining 30 per cent of employers to make a ""concerted push"" to get their unvaccinated employees to be vaccinated as soon as possible.On Saturday (Oct 23), Singapore's Covid-19 multi-ministry taskforce said 96 per cent of the country's workforce is vaccinated. Of the remaining 113,000 unvaccinated employees, over 10 per cent are seniors.This article was first published in The Business Times. ",https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_image/public/original_images/Oct2021/20211026_employees_reuters.jpg?itok=1PVkS6Za,"Singapore studying geothermal energy as potential source for power generation - CNA
SINGAPORE: Energy from underground heat could help to power cooling systems and water desalination processes in future, as Singapore studies the potential of harnessing geothermal energy.Exploratory studies will be carried out in the northern and eastern parts of Singapore, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) announced on Tuesday (Oct 26).These areas have been identified based on higher surface temperature measurements, it added.One of the study sites is Sembawang Hot Spring Park, where researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), research platform TUM CREATE and Surbana Jurong are seeking to obtain temperature data and improve estimations of Singapore’s geothermal resource potential.“Previous studies have given us simulated estimations, and our current study aims to improve these estimations by obtaining temperature data at locations we think to have higher temperatures, possibly near the Sembawang hot spring,” said Associate Professor Alessandro Romagnoli, who leads the study.To do this, the team will use a combination of computer models and seismic surveys to study Singapore’s geological features.Preliminary findings from the exploratory studies will be established by the end of next year, said EMA.Speaking at the opening of the Singapore-International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) High-Level Forum, Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng said advancements in technologies, coupled with the declining costs, have enabled policymakers and industry leaders to significantly advance the role of renewables in the global energy systems.""In Singapore, recent developments in geothermal technology, such as advanced geothermal systems which harness heat from deep dry rock, may allow Singapore to harness geothermal energy at greater depths, with minimal impact to environment and safety,"" said Dr Tan, who is also Manpower Minister.Singapore is also keen to accelerate the development and deployment of emerging low-carbon alternatives, such as hydrogen and carbon storage to support the energy transition, he added. A renewable energy source, geothermal energy is derived from heat within the sub-surface of the earth, which is carried to the surface via water or steam.Depending on its characteristics, geothermal energy can be used for heating and cooling purposes, or be harnessed to generate clean electricity.If a large amount of heat can be extracted, this can be harnessed to generate clean electricity.In Singapore, a geothermal resource with temperature of more than 140 degrees Celsius can be used to produce electricity, according to Associate Professor Alessandro Romagnoli from the Nanyang Technological University School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.Geothermal energy covers a significant share of electricity demand in countries like New Zealand, Kenya and the Philippines.While installed capacity has increased over the years, challenges in deploying geothermal energy such as geographical limitations as well as higher per-unit capital costs remain.As a result, geothermal energy today accounts for less than 1 per cent of globally installed renewable energy capacity.Data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) shows that geothermal energy made up just 0.5 per cent of total renewable energy capacity.In comparison, hydropower and wind accounted for 43 per cent and 26 per cent of global installed renewable energy capacity respectively last year.If the studies yield positive results, EMA said further research will be conducted to determine the viability and scalability of deploying geothermal systems in Singapore.“If found to be feasible, geothermal energy could serve as a new and additional source of indigenous clean energy besides solar for power generation in Singapore,” said EMA.EMA added that if Singapore adopts geothermal energy for power generation in future, it would be one of the first countries to deploy next-generation geothermal systems in a densely-populated.“More importantly, it would support Singapore’s effort to lower its power sector’s carbon emissions, and help meet its climate change targets,” said EMA.While the country has taken great strides to improve energy efficiency and ramp up solar deployment over the past few years, the power sector still accounts for around 40 per cent of total carbon emissions.The country has pledged to halve its 2030 peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a view to achieve net zero emissions as soon as viable in the second half of the century.On Monday, Singapore said it intends to  (GW) of low-carbon electricity by 2035, making up about 30 per cent of its electricity supply in that year.It will be calling for proposals to outline the requirements for electricity imports, including how they should be from low-carbon sources, from November.A total of S$55 million was also awarded to fund 12 projects on low-carbon energy technology solutions.We know it's a

"Shooting death on set of Alec Baldwin film: Assistant director previously sacked over gun safety - CNA
According to a producer for Rust, the assistant director, Dave Halls, was fired from the set of Freedom's Path in 2019 after a crew member was injured when a gun was ""unexpectedly discharged"". The assistant director who handed Alec Baldwin the loaded weapon that killed a cinematographer had been sacked from a previous production for gun safety violations, the company said on Monday (Oct 25).The news came as it was reported that crew members had used that same weapon for live-ammunition target practice on the day Halyna Hutchins died. on the set of low-budget Western, Rust, when Baldwin fired a weapon that assistant director Dave Halls had told him was safe, using the industry lingo ""cold gun"".""Dave Halls was fired from the set of Freedom's Path in 2019 after a crew member incurred a minor and temporary injury when a gun was unexpectedly discharged,"" a producer for the as-yet-unreleased movie told AFP.""Halls was removed from set immediately after the prop gun discharged. Production did not resume filming until Dave was off-site. An incident report was taken and filed at that time.""Attention has focused on Halls and 24-year-old armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed in the wake of the tragedy on the set near Santa Fe, New Mexico.An armourer is tasked with supplying and keeping weapons safe on set, ensuring that they are accounted for at all times, and locked away when not in use.But entertainment trade website The Wrap reported on Monday that crew members had been using the weapons just hours before Hutchins was killed.""A number of crew members had taken prop guns from the New Mexico set of the indie Western – including the gun that killed Hutchins – to go 'plinking', a hobby in which people shoot at beer cans with live ammunition,"" the website said, citing an unidentified individual with knowledge of the set.The producers of Rust did not respond to multiple AFP requests for comment.GUN POINTED AT CAMERAThe developments came as a narrative of the tragedy emerged from an affidavit submitted by Santa Fe sheriffs as they sought a search warrant.The document explains how Baldwin was practising drawing his gun from his holster and pointing it at the camera when the accident happened.The 63-year-old was ""sitting in a pew in a church building setting, and he was practising a cross draw"", director Joel Souza said in the affidavit, ""pointing the revolver towards the camera lens"".Souza told investigators he was looking over Hutchins' shoulder ""when he heard what sounded like a whip and then loud pop"".The director said he remembered the 42-year-old Hutchins ""grabbing her midsection"".""Halyna began to stumble backwards and she was assisted to the ground,"" the affidavit said. ""Joel explained that he was bleeding from his shoulder and he could see blood on Halyna.""Hutchins was declared dead in hospital a short time later. Souza, 48, was treated by doctors and sent home.No one has been charged and no arrests have been made.The incident happened after a lunch break, Souza said in the affidavit, and the director wasn't sure if the gun had been checked again for safety after the break.Halls handed one of three prop guns to Baldwin that had been set up on a cart by Gutierrez-Reed, the document says.""(Halls) yelled 'Cold Gun', indicating the prop gun did not have any live rounds,"" it said. ""(Halls) did not know live rounds were in the prop-gun.""NEGLIGENCE AND UNPROFESSIONALISMThe film's gaffer – or chief electrician – said he held Hutchins in his arms as she was dying, writing an angry Facebook post which alleges the shooting was a result of ""negligence and unprofessionalism"".""There is no way a twenty-four-year-old woman can be a professional with armory,"" Serge Svetnoy wrote, adding: ""Professionals are the people who have spent years on sets, people who know this job from A to Z.""""To save a dime sometimes, you hire people who are not fully qualified for the complicated and dangerous job, and you risk the lives of the other people who are close and your lives as well,"" he said.Veteran Hollywood armoUrer Guillaume Delouche told AFP he was ""very surprised"" that somebody of Gutierrez-Reed's age and inexperience ""could be a chief armoUrer on a movie that has to have a lot of gunfighting scenes"".Rust was only her second film as chief armoUrer. She is the daughter of expert Hollywood armorer Thell Reed, whose credits include Django Unchained.Gutierrez-Reed could not be reached for comment, and has deleted her social media profiles.Baldwin's wife Hilaria on Monday took to Instagram to convey her sorrow over the fatal shooting.""My heart is with Halyna.

Prop master Neal W Zoromski said he was offered the Alec Baldwin film Zoromski, who has worked in Hollywood for 30 years, told the The Los Angeles Times he was approached by production managers to work as a prop master on Rust, the film where actor Baldwin on Thursday (21 October) shot two crew members with a prop gun, killing one.The role included responsibilities for all the set props — including firearms, wagons and flour sacks — to transform the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico into Kansas in the 1880s.However, after four days of internal discussions, Zoromski, whose previous film credits included Thank You For Smoking and The Day After Tomorrow, said he got a “bad feeling”.Based on his conversations, Zoromski explained, it seemed like there was a greater focus on saving money, even at the cost of compromising set safety protocols. Additionally, he said his questions were dismissed by the film’s managers.Despite the initial interest in working on Rust, Zoromski decided he couldn’t ignore the “massive red flags” and turned down the opportunity. He told the publication: “After I pressed ‘send’ on that last email, I felt, in the pit of my stomach: ‘That is an accident waiting to happen.’”In a statement to Deadline, the Rust production said: “The safety of our cast and crew is the top priority of Rust Productions and everyone associated with the company.” The production team said it had not been “made aware of any official complaints concerning weapon or prop safety on set” but that “an internal review of our procedures” would be conduction while production is halted. On 21 October, Baldwin misfired a prop gun on the sets of Rust in a tragic incident that led to 42-year-old cinematographer Halyna Hutchins’s death. The film’s director Joel Souza was also injured in the shooting and rushed to a nearby hospital. He was . According to court documents filed by the Santa Fe Sheriff’s department on Sunday (24 October), the film’s assistant director Dave Halls handed Baldwin the “cold gun”, indicating it was safe for use.Explaining how the shooting had occurred, the director of Crown Vic said that Baldwin had been sitting in a wooden church pew, rehearsing a scene that involved “cross drawing” a gun and pointing it at the camera lens.Souza  and saw Hutchins stumble backwards while clutching her midriff. Souza was standing behind the cinematographer and was wounded by the bullet that went through Hutchins and hit his right shoulder.A cameraman who was working when the shooting occurred also told authorities that six crew members had walked off set that day. They were reportedly having problems with the production over housing and payment.He added that they had outlined these concerns in a letter to Rust production managers and that Baldwin was “very careful” of his surroundings when rehearsing or shooting with firearms, citing an instance when the 63-year-old actor ensured that no children were present when he discharged a gun.Neal Zoromski and Alec Baldwin Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In his video, Chappelle refuted accounts that he was invited to speak to transgender employees at Netflix and refused. “That is not true. If they had invited me I would have accepted it,"" he said. Comedian Dave Chappelle on Monday (Oct 25) addressed the transgender controversy at Netflix in full for the first time on a video on his Instagram account, five days after about 100 people protested near the streaming company’s headquarters.The employee backlash began after Netflix Inc decided to release Chappelle’s new comedy special, The Closer, which critics say ridicules transgender people.“It’s been said in the press that I was invited to speak to transgender employees at Netflix and I refused,” Chappelle said in the video. “That is not true. If they had invited me I would have accepted it. Although I am confused about what we are speaking about ... You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. Well it seems like I’m the only one that can’t go to the office anymore.”“I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames this as me versus that community, it’s not what it is,” Chappelle said. “Do not blame the LBGTQ community for any of this shit. This has nothing to do with them. It’s about corporate interest and what I can say and what I cannot say.”Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos stoked further unrest with an Oct 11 staff memo in which he acknowledged Chappelle’s provocative language in The Closer but said it did not cross the line into inciting violence.In interviews before the walkout, Sarandos acknowledged “I screwed up” in how he spoke to Netflix’s staff about the special.In Monday’s video, Chappelle said that after the controversy he began getting disinvited from film festivals that had accepted a documentary he made last summer, and that he is now making that documentary available in ten American cities.“Thank god for Ted Sarandos and Netflix,” Chappelle said. “He’s the only one who didn’t cancel me yet.”We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

We all grow up carrying the scars of our childhood and that can influence us in many ways.Mental health has been a subject of importance in recent times (especially due to the pandemic) and on the , local actress Sheila Sim, 37, opened up to host Quan Yi Fong about why she decided to see a psychologist.When she was 30, a sense of emptiness, coupled with the insecurity that stemmed from her rough times as a child and a young adult, prompted her to seek help.""I'd gone through ups and downs as a child. I'd been looking for answers but to no avail. I'd also had some rocky relationships. I subsequently suspected the problem lay with me. I'd have the same problems with different boyfriends. They'd ultimately lead to breakups,"" she said.At her worst, Sheila was even violent during her past relationships.She said: ""That time, I was so mad that I couldn't express myself with words. I started biting myself and my boyfriend... It was most atrocious and horrible. I felt I needed to see a shrink.""Sheila sought answers and through therapy, established that her insecurity was the cause.She explained: ""Those who are insecure need their partner to make them feel secure. That's the biggest problem. Your partner can't give you a sense of security. A sense of security comes from within yourself.""[[nid:549689]]When asked how insecurity can harm a relationship, Sheila raised an example of someone who might doubt their partner if they don't reinforce their love for them constantly.""This stems from your own sense of emptiness and emotional instability. You may feel unloved due to past family incidents and you need your partner to reinforce or remind you of his love for you. This is tiresome for your partner,"" she shared.The journey of self-discovery was a long one for the model-turned-actress and she had to piece herself back together.However, she is now in a loving, stable and healthy relationship with her husband Deon Woo and the couple have a one-year-old daughter Layla.Sheila has also completed a course in positive psychology.Speaking on her journey, she said: ""It was a long process.

"Singapore Team Builds Device to 'Talk' to Plants Through Electric Signals - The Wire Science
A Venus flytrap plant. Photo: Andi Superkern/UnsplashKolkata: The curious form and features of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) have intrigued scientists for centuries. Charles Darwin described it as “one of the most wonderful [plants] in the world”. He was fascinated by how the plant survived and evolved by adapting itself in nutrient-poor, adverse habitats.Many decades later, Jagadish Chandra Bose, a plant physiologist among other things, observed the plant’s leaves were sensitive to touch, and generated electrical impulses – much like the signals in our bodies.Now, researchers at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, have found a way to control these electrical impulses. They have developed an electronic system that can deliver electrical signals to plants and receive signals back, processed through a smartphone application.According to the team, their invention could help farmers ‘communicate’ with their plants and learn about damage due to pests and/or environmental stress. The paper describing the study was published in January 2021.The researchers were led by materials scientist Xiaodong Chen. They first created a conformable electrode – a piece of conductive material whose shape could be modified in simple ways, like bent or lightly compressed. They fixed it on the waxy leaf of a Venus flytrap plant using a hydrogel adhesive. Hydrogels are polymers that can hold a large amount of water and are very light.This way, the electrode acts as a window through which plant signals are sent to the smartphone app, and vice versa. It intercepts electric signals moving through the plant, which the app can decode to mean different things based on their strength, frequency, timing, etc. Chen and his colleagues described its construction in a different paper published in March.“The soft electrode on the Venus flytrap is a transparent film. It is actually a ‘signal translator’ between plants and human beings,” Chen said in an email to The Wire Science. “You can think of it as a stethoscope used by doctors to sense information inside the body of patients.”According to him, attaching the ‘soft electrode’ to a Venus flytrap plant turned it into a ‘soft robot’ – capable of receiving instructions and relaying data. The plant could be used to ‘catch’ small objects using the jaw-like portions at the ends of its leaves, for example. “We are now exploring more tasks the robot can do,” Chen wrote.Similarly, the electrode could also pick up on any distress signals – such as excessive heat or soil salinity – before the plant shows outward symptoms, allowing its grower to act sooner and reduce waste.“Most agricultural practices rely on pesticides, chemical fertilisers and mechanisation to protect the crops” – and their use is “based on a farmer’s personal experiences.” This subjective evaluation, Chen added, leads to farmers using the resources at their disposal in suboptimal fashion.The NTU team believes it can cut down such waste by deploying a “cluster” of sensors in a field of plants such that each sensor can describe the micro-environment shared by a group of plants, whose needs can then be managed by what the sensors relay.Arunendra Nath Lahiri Majumder, is a plant biotechnologist at Bose Institute, Kolkata, where he has been studying environmental stress responses in paddy. He wasn’t involved in the NTU study, and thinks that at this stage, plant-based electrodes “would be an a priori hypothesis awaiting a proof of concept” in case of paddy.According to him, the sensory mechanisms of the Venus flytrap are quite different from those of rice, which doesn’t show any observable movement. “In fact, plants like Venus flytrap, Mimosa pudica, Nepenthes sp. or Desmodium show certain characteristic movements to suit their physiology,” Majumder told The Wire Science.“Such effects are believed to originate from the electrical conductivity in associated cells or tissues typical of each plant. Despite intense research in this area, the cellular phenomena [underlying] the sensory mechanism are yet to be determined for other plants like rice.”Chen agreed, saying, “Plants indeed contain many different types of signals” and their current technique applies only to electrical signals, not chemical, light, acoustic, etc. “We hope to expand the capability of our device to more signal types so that we can understand plants better,” he said.In its published paper, Chen’s team speculated on a variety of potential applications as a result. “In particular,” they write in one place, “the ability to interfere with a plant’s electrophysiology through external electrical stimulation opens new possibilities for building plant communication protocols.”But any agricultural revolution that such a technology may herald will have to wait. According to Majumder, the NTU’s idea will have to be further studied and tested, and that the idea in its current form is “premature”.Chandana Chandra is a freelance science journalist based in Kolkata.Vasudevan Mukunth, editor: mukunth@thewire.inGeneral enquiries: science@thewire.in",https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25080009/andi-superkern-7SeRQRY_g0k-unsplash-1600x899.jpg,"One small step to space food production: Japan seeks firms to develop regenerative food supply system for space exploration - FoodNavigator-Asia.com
The Artemis Program is an international programme headed by the United States, and Japan announced last year that it will be participating in this programme which aims to return humans to the surface of the moon by 2024. It would be the first manned lunar landing mission since Apollo 17 back in 1972.“In order for human beings to stay and work in outer space for a prolonged time [to carry out the mission objectives of] the Artemis Program, it is important to develop a practical space food solution to support this,”​ Japan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) announced via a formal statement.“Currently, even foods used on the International Space Station (ISS) are produced and processed on Earth, and then brought up – but for long-term sustainable manned space activities to be performed on the moon, on Mars or elsewhere in the universe, there is a need for food that dramatically improves the quality of life (QOL) in closed spaces and can be efficiently produced on the moon or elsewhere.​“Here, regenerative technologies that can make recyclable use of resources are needed to [ensure] the stability of this food supply.”​Amongst the technologies that Japan is prioritising includes advanced food production technologies which have till now been more commonly focused on the production of alternative protein to replace meat consumption across the globe, such as cultured meat and fermentation technology.“We are assuming that the food production site will be installed on a lunar base, and will need to be equipped with items such as optimal environmental control, automated work equipment, as well as closed-type cultivation technologies that maximise production capacity,”​ said MAFF.“[Some of the technologies we are looking at include] microalgae cultivation, advanced cultured meat technology and more – the focus is that the food supply system must be efficient in its production capacity and also its resource-regenerative functionality. Organic waste will be treated using both biological and physiochemical treatments.”​Raising the quality of life for astronauts who will be staring in outer space is also a priority, and here Japan is looking to also use technology to ensure that this is optimised.“We will also be formulating QOL evaluation indicators which will be based on [life in a] closed and isolated environment, and develop sensing technologies and other solutions based on this,”​ said the ministry.“The hope is that the optimisation of the food provided will be able to maintain and also improve their QOL – a QOL management system will also be developed in accordance with this.”​Prior to any interplanetary setup though, all technologies will first be put to the test with a lunar base simulation facility on Earth, and a space experimentation module to demonstrate the system integration of both the proposed food supply system and QOL improvement technology.At present, space foods are mainly required to have a long shelf life and to be able to survive the transportation into space. Many big Japanese food and retail firms are involved in the production of these, from Nissin Foods’ ramen noodles to Morinaga’s milk powder to Lawson’s fried chicken​.But the hurdle here remains that these would often have to be processed products, and fresh produce is much more rarely available to ISS astronauts - microalgae-based foods firm Sophie’s BioNutrients’ CEO and Co-Founder Eugene Wang believes that advanced technologies, such as fermentation technology, have major potential to change that.“Certain microalgae, like the strain we use, does not require sunlight but only nutrients, allowing us to grow it in a fermentation tank. This conserves the amount of space needed, and by controlling the conditions and nutrients it can grow very quickly with controllable functionalities,”​ he told us.“This technology would allow for astronauts making a journey even to Mars and back, much less the moon, to have a nutritious, sustainable, fresh food source even if they wished to stay there for a longer time.”​

We might have just seen our first exoplanet in another galaxy - Techradar
Astronomers at the Chandra X-ray Observatory just announced that they might have identified an exoplanet in another galaxy for the first time ever.The possible exoplanet candidate was spotted in the spiral galaxy Messier 51 (M51), according to a . The observatory was monitoring X-rays coming from a binary star system in M51 when they saw dimming in the X-ray source, a strong indication of a planetary transit.""We are trying to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds by searching for planet candidates at X-ray wavelengths, a strategy that makes it possible to discover them in other galaxies,"" said Rosanne Di Stefano, from Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institute's Center for Astrophysics and the lead author of the study published today in Nature Astronomy.The system itself isn't any old star system, though. Astronomers suspect that the X-rays are the product of either a neutron star or even a black hole that is feeding off its partner star, making this planet even more intriguing.Thousands of possible exoplanets have been spotted in our own galaxy, and over 150 have been confirmed. The most common method for identifying exoplanet candidates is the transit method, which is when you look at the amount of light being radiated by a star and watch for dips in the star's brightness. This would indicate that something passed in front of the light source, and if there is a regular period to the dips in the light seen from the star and the dip is of the same magnitude, then you can confirm that there is a planet in orbit around that star. The exoplanet candidate spotted in M51 was seen in the same way, only instead of using visible light as with our current transit method for stars nearer to us, this method used X-ray emissions instead.The X-ray emissions are coming from either a neutron star or a black hole orbiting a larger star in a binary system. The companion star is estimated to have about 20 times the mass of the sun and is feeding the accretion disk around its partner, which is emitting the X-rays that the astronomers were able to observe.During their observation, they saw the X-ray emissions stop entirely for about 3 hours, which – along with other data – could indicate a Saturn-sized planet transiting in front of the X-ray source at a distance of about twice Saturn's distance from the sun.This was only the first diminution of X-rays spotted though, so it's too soon to say whether this is a planet or not – and confirmation could take decades. The researchers calculated that the planet's orbital period would be about 70 years, based on its size and distance.""Unfortunately to confirm that we're seeing a planet we would likely have to wait decades to see another transit,"" said Nia Imara, of the University of California at Santa Cruz and co-author of the study. ""And because of the uncertainties about how long it takes to orbit, we wouldn't know exactly when to look.""While exciting in itself, this new method of detecting planetary transits in binary systems offers another method for spotting exoplanets here in our own galaxy.Since the X-ray emitting region of an accretion disk in these systems is small, a planet could completely block the X-ray source entirely, which is a much clearer indicator of a transit than measuring often subtle changes in the luminosity of a star.It should also be said that the planets spotted using this method would also have suffered through some pretty turbulent times. The collapse of a star into a neutron star or black hole isn't the most peaceful of transitions, and the supernova that created them would have blasted the planet with some extreme radiation levels that would almost certainly strip it of any life that might have been living on it.Then there's also the matter of the other star in the system. It hasn't gone supernova yet, but the steady loss of its material to its companion means that its demise is accelerating, so it would only be a matter of time before it too went supernova, blasting the planet again.Life in these systems is highly unlikely, to say the least. Still, the X-ray transit method could prove useful in growing our catalog of planets outside our solar system.John (He / Him / His) is TechRadar's Computing Staff Writer and is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY. Named by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.You can find him online on Twitter at @thisdotjohnCurrently playing: Back 4 Blood, Metroid Dread, EVE OnlineThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

A life-size model of the rover will be rolling across the country as part of the “Roving With Perseverance” tour.While NASA’s Perseverance rover and Ingenuity Mars Helicopter are hard at work exploring Mars hundreds of millions of miles from Earth, their “twin” models will be visiting museums as part of the “Roving With Perseverance” roadshow. As big as a car, with its camera “head” rising high, Perseverance’s six-wheeled lookalike towers over most visitors, while Ingenuity’s double highlights just how small the history-making rotorcraft is. The tour begins in October at venues on the East and West Coasts, then works its way inland.Since landing on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021, Perseverance has been hunting for signs of ancient microscopic life in order to collect and store samples of Martian rock and sediment to be retrieved by planned future missions for closer study on Earth. After hitching a ride to Mars on Perseverance’s belly, the Ingenuity helicopter has completed more than a dozen short flights, not only proving that powered, controlled flight is possible on Mars, but even helping scout potential locations for Perseverance to explore.In addition to the spacecraft models, NASA Perseverance and Ingenuity scientists and engineers will give in-person and virtual talks and answer questions at various museums. The in-person events will include live activities at three venues to coincide with the one-year anniversary of Perseverance landing on Mars. Some exhibits will include digital displays with video, latest images, and sounds from the Martian surface to provide an authentic sample of what the rover is encountering as it explores the Red Planet.

"The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros are already discounted at Amazon - Yahoo Singapore News
Apple's latest pro-level notebooks are barely one week old and they've already received a discount on Amazon. Both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M1 Pro CPUs are $50 off right now — that means you can grab the 512GB 14-inch model for $1,950 or the 512GB 16-inch version for $2,450. Is it a huge discount? No, but it's notable for Apple's newest laptops for which price might be a big barrier to entry for some. Both laptops will ship starting tomorrow. Despite being announced just last week, we managed to check out the latest MacBook Pros and gave them a score of 92. Apple addressed a lot of complaints people had with its high-end laptops here, namely their lack of ports. Both machines have three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI connector, a MagSafe power port, a headphone jack and an SD card reader. The only thing missing is a USB-A port, but that's a small sacrifice to make when you have so many connectivity options that you didn't have on previous MacBook Pros.To house these bevy of ports, the new MacBook Pros are thicker and slightly heavier than previous editions, but they remain portable (the 14-inch a bit more so than the 16-inch). They also have lovely Liquid Retina XDR displays capable of reaching 1,600 nits of brightness thanks to their Mini-LED backlighting. They also support 120Hz refresh rates with ProMotion, which will help prevent your eyes from getting fatigued after hours of scrolling through documents and web pages. The webcam notch is a noticeable difference as well, albeit one that might frustrate some, but at least the 1080p webcam is a big upgrade from the 720p camera in previous models.Unsurprisingly, the new MacBook Pros have stellar performance. While the M1 chipset in last year's laptops fell a bit short when it came to heavy duty creative work, the M1 Pro processors remedy that and we found the SSDs in these Pros to be speedy as well. While those who need serious power for 3D renderings and similar tasks may still want to consider machines with dedicated GPUs, others will find the power provided in the new MacBook Pros to be more than sufficient. And they last long, too — the 14-inch model survived over 12.5 hours in our testing, while the 16-inch machine lasted over 16.5 hours. If you knew during Apple's event last week that the latest MacBook Pro was the laptop for you, now's a good time to grab one while you can save a few dollars in the process.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ffErSnZtdbx5MCPkCag7NQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU5Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c,"Apple AirPods 3 review - TechRadar
The Apple AirPods (3rd generation) represent a big step up from their predecessors in terms of audio performance, connectivity, and design - and while they come with a price increase, we think they’re a worthy upgrade if you have the older AirPods. However, we wouldn’t necessarily recommend them for Android users. The AirPods 3 are unsurprisingly optimized for use within the wider Apple ecosystem, so Android users miss out on a lot of the extra features that set them apart from other true wireless earbuds on the market, and the lack of noise cancellation means they aren’t the most high-spec earbuds at this price. The Apple AirPods 3 are the latest in the company’s lineup of true wireless earbuds and over-ear headphones, and come with a host of updates that make them a worthy upgrade from their predecessors, the AirPods 2. At $179 / £169 / AU$279 they aren’t cheap, but neither are they as pricey as Apple’s noise-cancelling earbuds, the AirPods Pro – and they’re a fraction of the price of the over-ear AirPods Max.  Price and release dateDesignAudio performanceBattery lifeConnectivityShould I buy them? A refreshed design retains the general look of the original AirPods, but introduces shorter stems and contoured housings, which feel more comfortable to wear than the previous model. Those stems now feature touch capacitive force sensors, which you can squeeze to control your music playback and accept and end phone calls. Their lightweight build and IPX4 water-resistance rating makes the AirPods 3 suitable for use while working out; and while they don’t feel as secure as earbuds such as the Powerbeats Pro, they were able to withstand a gentle jog without falling out of our ears. While these new design features are welcome, we were most impressed by the improvements Apple has made to the audio performance of these earbuds. New drivers and amplifiers provide a well-balanced sound, while Spatial Audio support promises to make the music you love sound more immersive than ever before. Whether you’re listening to tracks mixed in Dolby Atmos, or regular stereo tracks that have been upscaled using the Spatial Audio technology, the result is breathtaking. The experience is only heightened when you use the AirPods 3 to watch films. You don’t need an iPhone to use Spatial Audio, either; as long as you have a Dolby Atmos-enabled phone and access to an app that supports the feature, you’re good to go. However, you shouldn’t mistake the AirPods 3 for audiophile-grade in-ear headphones. Support for hi-res audio is lacking, and the treble frequencies can be harsh at times – a problem that was evident with the second-generation AirPods.Calls sound clear thanks to a new acoustic mesh that covers the AirPods’ outward-facing microphones and support for the AAC-ELD codec.The battery life of the AirPods 3 has also been improved compared to the AirPods 2, although the difference is negligible if you’re using them with Spatial Audio enabled. Have that particular feature switched off, however, and you can expect up to 30 hours of playback, which is more than enough to get you through a week of commuting. Rather predictably, connectivity is very good indeed – as long as you’ve already bought into the wider Apple ecosystem. Pairing the buds with an iPhone 13 mini was as easy as opening the wireless charging case and tapping the prompt that appeared on our screen. Owners of iOS 15 devices also get some extra connectivity features from the AirPods (3rd generation), which include hands-free Hey Siri activation, Announce Notifications, Audio Sharing, Group Facetime with Spatial Audio, and integration with Apple’s Find My network. These extra quality of life features are what differentiate the AirPods 3 from rival models – and they make the exclusion of active noise cancellation easier to swallow. Unfortunately, if you don’t have access to an iOS device, you lose out on all of these features. As such, we wouldn’t recommend the AirPods 3 for anyone who isn’t already invested in Apple’s line of smartphones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches. But, if you love all things Apple and want a pair of wireless earbuds that ‘just work’, then the AirPods 3 are a fantastic choice, and a huge step up from the AirPods 2. The Apple AirPods 3 (2021) cost $179 / £169 / AU$279 and are available to . They officially go on sale on October 26, both in-store and online.That’s cheaper than the noise-cancelling AirPods Pro, and a little pricier than the second-gen AirPods, which cost $159 / £159 / AU$249 at their 2019 launch with the standard charging case. If you opted for the wireless charging case, you’d have to pay $199 / £199 / AU$319. The wireless charging case comes as standard with the AirPods 3. The price of the second-gen AirPods has since been reduced. Apple is now selling them for $129 / £119 / AU$219, and they’re sure to be discounted even further over Black Friday. Compared to other true wireless earbuds on the market, the AirPods (3rd generation) are cheaper than many of our top picks, such as the Sony WF-1000XM4 and the NuraTrue earbuds. However, earbuds at this price tend to come with active noise cancellation, which the AirPods 3 are lacking.There are plenty of cheaper wireless earbuds available to buy, too. Earbuds such as the  and the Lypertek TruePlay Z3 2.0 offer outstanding audio performances for their prices, and models such as the Beats Studio Buds even come with active noise cancellation for $149.99 / £129.99 / AU$199.95. In terms of design, the AirPods 3 don't deviate too far from previous AirPods models, with an all-white minimalist aesthetic, protruding stems, and gently curved lines.With shorter stems and softly contoured housings, the AirPods 3 look more like the AirPods Pro than the second-gen AirPods, giving them a more streamlined, elegant look. Those stems feature touch-capacitive force sensors – just like the ones found on the AirPods Pro – that allow you to control your music playback with a squeeze of the stem. You can also squeeze the stem to accept or end calls.We found the controls to be super-responsive, and we liked the little ‘click’ sound that lets you know that your touch has been registered. As with the AirPods Pro, some haptic feedback would also be welcome – a slight vibration from the buds themselves rather than a click, but that isn’t a dealbreaker by any means. It’s a shame there’s no way to control the volume of your music via the buds themselves, perhaps by sliding your finger up and down the stems. For that, you’ll need to ask Siri, or dig your phone out of your pocket. Unlike the AirPods Pro, there are no interchangeable eartips. Retaining the semi-open design of the second-gen AirPods will appeal to those who don’t like the feeling of earbuds being pushed into their ear canals, but it does mean that sound isolation isn’t the best. You’ll be able to hear pretty much everything that’s going on around you while using the AirPods 3, plus there’s a degree of sound leakage, too – something to consider if you’re using them in a crowded setting and don’t want everyone listening in on your music. To mitigate the audio loss that comes with a semi-open design, the housings have been shaped to funnel sound straight into your ears – and it appears to be pretty effective.The AirPods 3 feel very comfortable, something that’s helped by the earbuds’ light weight. At 4.28g each, the AirPods 3 won’t make you feel like you’ve got two lumps of lead shoved in your ears, and they shouldn’t irritate smaller ears thanks to their smooth, contoured shape.We’re not sure how secure they feel, though. We took them out on a light jog, and while the AirPods didn’t fall out of our ears, we wouldn’t be willing to bet our lives on them staying put through a more vigorous workout. If you’re concerned about losing an earbud, we’d recommend opting for a pair with built-in earfins, or a pair of neckbuds that have the added security of a cable. Speaking of exercise, the AirPods 3 are fully equipped to handle a little sweat through workout or being caught out in the rain, thanks to an IPX4 rating. That rating applies to the case, too. The charging case itself is much squatter than the case accompanying the AirPods 2. It more closely resembles the AirPods Pro charging case, with a light, compact build and a flip-top lid that’s easy to open one-handed. Opening the case causes a small LED on its front to light up: green, if the AirPods are fully charged; amber, if less than one full charge remains. This light will also flash white if the AirPods are ready to pair with one of your devices.At the bottom of the charging case is a Lightning port, although you can top up the battery using a Qi-certified charging mat, or an Apple MagSafe charger. You get a USB-C to Lighning cable included in the box, but you’ll have to source your own plug.Overall, the design of the AirPods 3 represents a big improvement over their predecessors. They’re slicker, more understated, and more robust, too. The AirPods 3 feel like a significant step up from their predecessors for audio quality. They come with new custom-made, low-distortion drivers and high dynamic range amplifiers.The latter are supposed to deliver “powerful bass with crisp, clean high frequencies”, according to Apple. The new earbuds certainly do better at conveying bass frequencies than the AirPods 2, and they offer a more powerful, warmer sound. These aren’t audiophile in-ear headphones by any means, but they’re a perfectly enjoyable listen, whether you’re playing music or podcasts. Thanks to support for Adaptive EQ (first seen on the AirPods Pro), the AirPods 3 should be somewhat tailored to your ears. This technology tunes the sound of the earbuds in real-time, based on how they fit in your ear. According to Apple, an inward-facing microphone monitors for sound, and then the computational audio that powers the Adaptive EQ feature tunes the low and mid frequencies ""to account for what may be lost due to variances in fit"". The AirPods 3 come with another trick up their sleeves: Spatial Audio support. Apple’s Spatial Audio technology takes 5.1, 7.1 and Dolby Atmos content and applies directional audio filters, placing sound in a 3D sphere. This makes it feel more immersive; as if the audio is coming at you from every angle. Until now, this feature only worked with the AirPods Pro and the AirPods Max, since it relies on their built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes to track the position of your head and ensure the sound is coming from the right direction. The same tech is at play in the AirPods 3, and the effect is super-impressive. We started by listening to a Dolby Atmos mix of The Doors’ Riders On The Storm on Apple Music.As the band members talk to each other at the start of the track, the spatial audio positioning of their voices makes it feel as though you’re in the room with them.When the drummer counts in, we hear the sound of a storm breaking. It feels as though rain is falling overhead, with rolling thunder panning from right to left. The positioning of the instruments in space is subtle, but effective. To our right is the mellow guitar, while the organ chugs away on our left. At the back of the soundstage, the bass and drums provide the rhythmic backbone of the track, while Jim Morrison’s dulcet vocal reverberates right at the front.Each instrument has its own space to shine, and the bass, mid, and treble frequencies feel well balanced. It isn’t the most detailed or rhythmically tight rendition we’ve heard of this particular track, but the AirPods 3 do a great job of conveying a sense of space, and the positioning of the different instruments in a virtual sphere.Michael Kiwanuka’s You Ain’t The Problem is equally impressive in this regard – although we did find the thrashing electric guitar lines to be way too prominent in the mix, to the point that the hooky ‘la-la-la’ section at the beginning of the song sounded subdued. The AirPods 3 seem to share the same issues with treble harshness as their predecessors, and busier tracks can sound muddy at times. Classical music fares very well in Spatial Audio. Listening to Saint Saëns’ Danse Macabre, and each instrument truly sings, from the booming tubas to the playful glockenspiel melodies. Devilish violin motifs and gentle woodwind sound detailed, and the AirPods 3 handle the rhythmic changes reasonably well for a pair of earbuds at this price. Listening without Spatial Audio enabled (you can switch this off by heading to the Control Center of your iPhone and holding down the volume slider), and the separation between different instruments is less impressive. Nevertheless, the soundstage is still pretty well balanced and pleasant to listen to. Codec support is limited – you’ve just got SBC and AAC. This means the AirPods 3 can’t handle hi-res audio streaming. It’s a shame, since Apple Music offers Lossless audio – and while Bluetooth hasn’t had the bandwidth necessary for truly lossless music streaming in the past, recent innovations such as Qualcomm aptX Lossless have made it possible. Spatial Audio for music works well, but the technology’s best application is for film. The AirPods 3 are more than capable of handling complicated Dolby Atmos soundtracks. Watching Blush, an animated short on Apple TV Plus, we felt as though rockets were really zooming past our head.As for phone calls, an acoustic mesh covers the outer beamforming microphones, which is designed to reduce the sound of wind and make your voice sound clear. The AirPods 3 also support the AAC-ELD codec, which Apple says will deliver ""Full HD voice quality"" – whatever that means. When making calls using the AirPods 3, recipients said that our voice sounded clear, and they didn’t notice any background noise.  The AirPods 3 come with improved battery life… sort of. While the 2019 AirPods offered 24 hours of playback in total (that's about five hours from the earbuds and a further 19 hours from the charging case), the new AirPods 3 offer a 30-hour max battery life. Apple says you get up to six hours of listening time or up to four hours of talk time from the buds themselves, with four additional charges from the case. If you're in a hurry, a quick five-minute charge will give you about an hour of playback. As with the AirPods Pro, the AirPods 3 come with a wireless charging case as standard, which is compatible with Apple's MagSafe ecosystem.That all sounds good, but the onboard battery life does drop to five hours if you have Spatial Audio enabled – which is the same playback time as the older AirPods. Since Spatial Audio is one of the main reasons to buy the AirPods 3 over the AirPods 2, you’re not really getting the benefit of the longer battery life. Not surprisingly, the AirPods 3 are optimized for use with Apple devices, with a one-touch setup that automatically pairs the buds with your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or MacBook. Audio Sharing means you can also share the audio stream between two sets of AirPods, AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max, while using your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Apple TV – pretty handy if you want to share your music without sharing your friends' grubby earbuds. We found this feature worked fairly seamlessly, although we did notice a drop in volume when sharing music with a friend.There's also a new skin-detect sensor that tells the AirPods 3 if the buds are actually in your ear, as opposed to on a table or inside your pocket. So, if they're not in your ear, music playback will be paused, which will presumably spare you some precious battery life.  As with the 2019 AirPods, you can summon Apple's voice assistant simply by saying 'Hey Siri'. We found the microphones were adept at picking up our voice.If you have an Apple device that runs iOS 15, you'll get access to a few extra features with the third-gen AirPods, including Spatial Audio and dynamic head tracking in Group FaceTime calls, alongside integration with the Find My network. You'll also get access to the Announce Notifications feature, which allows Siri to read you time-sensitive updates from apps such as Messages, Reminders, and Calendar – it’s a handy feature if you like to keep up with your notifications without being glued to your phone.You want to experience Spatial Audio

Read more: CNET's Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro reviewsThis year, there are two phones in the flagship Pixel series, the $599 (£599) Pixel 6 and $899 (£849) Pixel 6 Pro. Of the two phones, the more affordable Pixel 6 is priced to compete with the iPhone 13, Samsung Galaxy S21 as well as other Android midtier phones like the Motorola Edge (2021). Check the table below for a full pricing breakdown.But beyond the fact that the Pixel 6 lineup is made by Google, boasts top-of-the-line cameras and the best Android update policy around, what makes it an interesting buy is what's found inside the device's revamped chassis. At the heart of the Pixel 6 series is that aforementioned Tensor system-on-a-chip. Tensor promises up to 48 hours of battery life, better ""real-time language translations, highly accurate voice transcription and high-end camera features like the ability to unblur the face of a person in motion,"" according to a report by CNET's Shara Tibken. This marks the first time the company has built its phones without a Qualcomm chipset, endeavoring instead to build its own in-house. And because Google created Tensor, it's extending security and OS support to Pixel owners to five years.Read more: By the way, if you want to cut to the chase, scroll down to our specs chart below, which compares the Pixel 6 series with the Pixel 5 series side-by-side.The Pixel 6 Pro and Pixel 6.As for Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, there are similarities in many ways, but the standout difference is probably the price. There's a $300 difference between the base and pro models. For ponying up the extra cash, you get added features including a larger and higher-res screen, a bigger battery, support for both sub-6 and millimeter-wave 5G (the ultrafast but less reliable flavor of 5G) and the third rear camera, a telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom. As a reference point, that's higher than the iPhone 13's 3x optical zoom. The Pixel 5 and 5A sit squarely in the midrange category, especially compared to the new Pixel 6 series. The Pixel 5 was Google's flagship phone last year, but its midrange position marked a departure from the pricey Pixel phones of years past. The Pixel 5 launched at $699 (£599, AU$999) and included 5G connectivity along with the fantastic cameras that have become the line's main selling point. But with that lowered asking price, Google chose to scale back on some features including the processor -- it went with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 765G.Read more: Like all phones in Google's A series, the 5A is a stripped-down version of the flagship Pixel 5.
