The two of them will keep on doing what they do when they’re asked to take the penalties.” Put to Solskjaer that Fernandes and Marcus Rashford shared penalties at the start of last season, he added: “I’ve got Cristiano, Bruno, Marcus, I’ve got players I trust to score every time they step up to take a penalty.“I’ve had this conversation, of course, and they know my position on it. They know that I decide who is going to shoot the penalty if we get one.“That’s not going to cause an issue. We’re here to win together. It’s not about my numbers or your numbers.

Ian Wright believes one Manchester United star could become a “frightening” prospect if he learns from Cristiano Ronaldo this season.Ronaldo signed a two-year contract with the option of a further season when completing his deadline-day switch from Juventus. It’s 12 years since he left Old Trafford for Real Madrid and his second homecoming will be against Newcastle on Saturday afternoon.And Wright believes that Ronaldo will be an awesome example to young striker Mason Greenwood. According to Sir Alex Ferguson the Bradford-born attacker is one of the best youngsters to come through the club’s academy.He has already been capped by England at senior level. But while Gareth Southgate may be concerned about the 19-year-old’s future game time, Wright thinks Ronaldo’s return will be a massive boost to the forward.Wright told Premier League Productions, via the Daily Mirror: “The only thing I can equate Ronaldo’s return to is just knowing that Dennis Bergkamp was coming for us at Arsenal and how that changed us. “I cannot even get into the realms of thinking what that is going to do for their academy players. Especially someone like Greenwood.“He can just watch now. Cristiano Ronaldo will probably want to impart and tell him what he needs to do.”Greenwood has scored in each of his side’s three games so far this term. But he could see his place taken by Ronaldo against Newcastle on Saturday afternoon.“I was speaking to Sir Alex the other day. We were playing golf and he mentioned about Mason Greenwood being one of the best they’ve ever had out of their academy,” added Wright.“Now you put one of the best players that’s ever played for the football club. He’s come back as a world icon to play with him and alongside him it’s frightening what this guy could turn into.“The mentality of him rubbing off on people could be the difference for Manchester United.”READ MORE:  ",https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/09/02210855/Cristiano-Ronaldo-celebrating-while-wearing-number-seven-shirt-for-Man-Utd-in-October-2008.jpg,"Chinese influences boost Raducanu's historic US Open run - Yahoo Singapore News
Emma Raducanu became the first qualifier to reach a Grand Slam final. Now the 18-year-old British sensation is one step from a historic US Open title.And a major reason for her success is influence from her Chinese heritage and the example of Li Na, China's first Grand Slam champion.Raducanu ousted Greek 17th seed Maria Sakkari 6-1, 6-4 on Thursday to book a berth in Saturday's US Open final against 19-year-old Canadian Leylah Fernandez, the first all-teenager Slam final in 22 years.""I just can't believe it,"" Raducanu said.

The Premier League’s contingent of Brazil internationals have all been cleared to play this weekend after their national association backed down in their bid to enforce a five-day playing ban.Six Premier League clubs decided not to release their Brazilian stars for the current international break. Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City, Leeds and Everton did so. They had concerns over their players travelling to a country on the UK government’s coronavirus red list, which would have forced quarantine.But in doing so, that angered the Brazilian FA. .That would have meant Liverpool being without Alisson, Fabinho and Roberto Firmino – who is nursing an injury – for Sunday’s trip to Leeds.Leeds are also affected, with Raphinha having been expected to miss the match at Elland Road.United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would have missed Fred, while Thiago Silva will have been ineligible for Chelsea’s clash with Aston Villa. The Chelsea and United stars would also have missed their clubs’ opening Champions League games on Tuesday.And finally, Manchester City would have been without goalkeeper Ederson and Gabriel Jesus ahead of their match against Leicester.However, there was widespread anger at the decision.Premier League bosses reacted angrily to the situation as it continued to develop on Friday, as they remained unsure whether they would be able to field some of their biggest names in the weekend’s fixtures. and “a lose, lose, lose situation for everyone – national teams, players, clubs”.Pep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel also had some strong words to say.Guardiola described the situation as “crazy”, while Tuchel added: “It makes no sense from which side you look at it. Does it make sense for Brazil? No. Does it make sense for us? No.”.Everton forward Richarlison, however, was due to avoid the five-day ban. That’s after the Brazilian Football Confederation looked upon his situation differently following his involvement at the Olympics.However,following extensive talks with FIFA, the FA and the Premier League, the associations of Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Paraguay agreed to waive the automatic five-day restriction they had the option of imposing.However, a resolution finally arrived late on Friday night. That’s little more than 12 hours before the weekend’s fixtures kick off.The ruling is also good news for a number of other clubs. Wolves and Mexico forward Raul Jimenez and Newcastle’s Paraguay midfielder Miguel Almiron are free to play. Watford’s Francisco Sierralta of Chile is also now available too.READ MORE:  ",https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/09/11070330/Fabinho.Brazil-1.jpg,"Arsenal are backing Mikel Arteta to pull club out of their downward spiral. Can he deliver? - ESPN
Don Hutchison predicts that Mikel Arteta will remain with Arsenal for only one more match before he makes his departure from the club. (0:59)Arsenal's home Premier League game against Norwich City on Saturday comes the day after the first anniversary of Mikel Arteta's ""That's recognition of what he's been doing from the day he walked in the door, but also where we see his capabilities,"" said Gunners chief executive Vinai Venkatesham on Sept. 10 last year. It also sent a clear message to an Arsenal squad polluted by complacency and division that Arteta would be given the authority to dispense with those individuals he either did not require, or believed were not fully committed. Yet he barely masked the toxicity behind the scenes, publicly vowing to track down a mole leaking information after news of a training ground bust-up became common knowledge in November before making this statement in May, reflecting on the 2020-21 campaign.-

- Don't have ESPN? Get instant access""The best thing has been to keep a team, a staff, employees and everybody together in those circumstances when you are not winning and when there are so many people, some inside and some outside, that are trying to hurt,"" said Arteta, who subsequently confirmed the people ""hurting"" the club were no longer there. And it is this cleansing that explains why the 39-year-old is not under immediate pressure from within, despite presiding over Arsenal's worst start to a season since 1954 with three consecutive Premier League defeats to Brentford, Chelsea and Manchester City.Arteta's judgement was backed further in the summer market as six players arrived for a cost of more than £140 million -- an investment even the fiercest critics of owners Kroenke Sports Enterprises must admit was beyond expectations -- and several players were moved on to new clubs having been identified as surplus to requirements. But now there are no excuses. Arteta has been in the job long enough to impose his methods and has received unanimous backing that stands as a remarkable show of faith in a man with no previous managerial experience.Arteta has regularly cited the absence of fans during the coronavirus pandemic as a vital missing ingredient in creating the alchemy required to catapult the Gunners back into the Champions League. Yet it is these same supporters who are likely to turn up the heat on Arteta if results do not quickly improve, especially during a more amenable run of fixtures. A defining period awaits.""We need to create a solid foundation,"" said Edu in an interview with Sky Sports last week, defending the club's summer transfer planning. ""I don't want to see the squad in one season. I'd like to see Arsenal strong in one, two, three, four and five seasons. That needs strategy.""To create a good foundation, you need time. I want to see the team play together and then let's judge the team. After that, no problem. Judge us then.""Arteta has been dealt an unfortunate hand, thrust into his first managerial role less than four months before COVID-19 shut down English football; the Spaniard was even the first high-profile figure in the game to test positive.A myriad of issues followed, ranging from , the club , head of football Raul Sanllehi's sudden departure, Mesut Ozil's protracted exit, social media abuse suffered personally and by several of his players, and Granit Xhaka's difficult reintegration  to ""f--- off.""Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang likely caused Arteta plenty of sleepless nights by himself, contracting malaria, missing games to tend to his sick mother, taking months to sign a new contract, turning up late for the north London derby and later contracting COVID-19.All of this was happening against a backdrop of persistent takeover talk and fans protesting at the ownership following the failed European Super League project. It's no wonder Arteta describes the last 18 months as ""unprecedented"" and undoubtedly formed the basis of Amazon's thinking in picking Arsenal as the subject of their latest ""All or Nothing"" series.It's also not difficult to imagine Amazon also made that choice because they could see the crossroads Arteta has now reached.Arteta inherited a squad in which discipline and professionalism had unravelled under his predecessor Unai Emery. Sources told ESPN that several players mocked Emery's broken English around the training ground, and there was a significant level of confusion at both his tactical approach and selection process. Jokes were made at his expense.""How many captains do we have?"" said one player within Emery's earshot, a reference to the Spaniard naming a five-man leadership group after Xhaka was stripped of the armband.Arteta quickly set about restoring order to the dressing room and structure to the team, identifying players he believed were corrosive. Although he never confirmed who the mole was or which individuals were the focus of ire, Arteta's confirmation in May that those players were no longer at the club made it clear, by a process of elimination, that he thought one or more of Ozil, Sead Kolasinac, Shkodran Mustafi and Sokratis Papastathopoulos were at fault as they all departed in January. Kolasinac's return following a loan spell at Schalke -- and subsequent inclusion in the team that lost 5-0 at Man City last month -- is either further evidence of Arsenal's inability to sell players or an indication he can be removed from the list of suspects.Ridding the training ground of unhappy players fostering -- and possibly breeding -- resentment was deemed necessary, but the process wasn't cheap. Ozil, earning £350,000 a week, received the majority of the money owed as a staggered pay-off over the final six months of his contract to depart. There were  and Sokratis, all largely at Arteta's direction as he used his reinforced status to break deadlocks that, in Ozil's case, had run for some time before his arrival.Exits continued to be difficult this summer, again compounded by COVID-19 making it a buyer's market this summer.There was also a failure to communicate clearly with fringe players, not least Ainsley Maitland-Niles, who expressed his frustration on social media by declaring ""all I wanna do is go where I'm wanted and where I'm gonna play."" A move to Everton collapsed on deadline day when Arteta held talks as the window closed, reassuring the midfielder he is part of his plans.Striker Eddie Nketiah was close to moving to Crystal Palace this summer, but the deal fell apart, although on this occasion the club privately insist the striker's agent was responsible rather than any failing on their end. He has a year left on his contract and has been offered a new deal, but why would he sign it?Incomings were complicated, too, as in fairness they often are at most clubs. A European agent working close to one of the players on Arsenal's list of targets this summer described the club's spending as ""strange and expensive."" Sources close to both selling clubs expressed surprise at the amounts the Gunners were eventually willing to pay for £32m acquisition of Aaron Ramsdale from Sheffield United and the £50m signing of Ben White from Brighton. However, Arsenal devised a strategy they have seen to fruition, signing six players all either 23 or under: Ramsdale, White, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Nuno Tavares, Tomiyasu and Martin Odegaard.The club have been brave in their approach, with KSE funding a rebuild as they said they would after the Super League collapsed in April. Arteta was instrumental in many deals, meeting players face-to-face to explain his vision for the future and their role within it. Edu dispensed with much of Arsenal's old scouting network in favour of promoting their own analytical database, StatDNA, but make no mistake: these are Arteta's signings.At this point, the work done in the market and behind the scenes has to be reflected on the pitch. Arteta's 2020 FA Cup success proved has significant potential as a coach, able to execute a game-plan to counter superior opposition. It required a solid defensive foundation and clinical finishing -- against Man City and Chelsea in the semifinal and final, Arsenal registered seven shots on target in total across both games, scoring four times -- both of which has been badly lacking so far this term.Midfielder Thomas Partey's imminent return from an ankle injury is viewed as a key piece of the puzzle, as will be the new signings settling in, Nicolas Pepe starting to justify his £72m fee and the continued development of Emile Smith Rowe alongside Bukayo Saka. White and Gabriel need to form the robust centre-back pairing Arteta claims they can be.Arteta believes fan support is also vital and that is true, just not necessarily in the way he thinks. Social media is no barometer of real life, but Arteta's critics point to a lack of progress since that FA Cup win and football which, frankly, has often been far from entertaining. The grumbles in his direction during their only home game to date, a 2-0 defeat to Chelsea, were audible throughout, and external pressure will quickly change the mood if things don't improve.It was understandable at the start of Arteta's reign that he focused on making Arsenal difficult to beat but after so many changes, Gunners fans are entitled to expect a team capable of imposing themselves on opponents, beating sides on their own terms. A run of fixtures comprising Norwich, Burnley, AFC Wimbledon (in the Carabao Cup), Tottenham and Brighton through to the next international break is also largely in their favour.We're about to find out if the trust Arsenal have shown in Arteta is worth it.",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/columnists/espn_generic_m.jpg&h=80&w=80&scale=crop
"Hackers possibly stole personal data of 79400 MyRepublic customers, including copies of NRICs - The Straits Times
This is the latest incident in a string of cyber attacks in recent months.The details stolen were identity verification documents related to customer applications for mobile services.MyRepublic said hackers may have accessed data including scanned copies of both sides of the NRICs belonging to Singaporeans and permanent residents, and other personal data of employment and dependent pass holders.An NRIC contains information including one's name, date of birth and home address. The NRIC number could be used to access official sites.Customers who ported an existing mobile service had their names and mobile numbers accessed, said the Internet service provider.However, it added that there is currently no indication that other personal data, such as account or payment information, was affected.MyRepublic systems were not compromised and there was no operational impact on MyRepublic's services, the company added.As scans of identity documents and mobile numbers might have been stolen, affected customers could be hit by more mobile spam messages or phishing attempts in the coming weeks, said Dr Stas Protassov, technology president of cyber-security firm Acronis.Cyber crooks could also try to hijack their identities.“I would expect some impersonation attacks and identity thefts that could lead to a victim’s accounts for services being taken over,” said Dr Protassov.He added that some crooks might even create new accounts in the victim’s name to conduct fraudulent activities.“No stolen data goes to waste these days,” he said. “If the immediate threat actors can’t profit from your data, they will sell it to someone who can.” On Aug 29, MyRepublic  discovered the unauthorised data access on a third-party data storage platform used to store the personal data of mobile customers.Access to the data storage facility has since been secured, said the mobile operator.Its cyber-incident response team has also been activated, including a team of external expert advisers such as KPMG, to work closely with MyRepublic's internal information technology and network teams to resolve the incident.MyRepublic has notified the Infocomm Media Development Authority and the Personal Data Protection Commission of the issue.The commission said it is aware of the incident and has contacted MyRepublic for more information. Apologising for the inconvenience caused by the incident, MyRepublic chief executive Malcolm Rodrigues said in a statement that the company is contacting customers and ""will continue to support our affected customers every step of the way to help them navigate this issue"".""We are also reviewing all our systems and processes, both internal and external, to ensure an incident like this does not occur again,"" he added.While there is no evidence that any personal data has been misused for now, MyRepublic said it will offer all affected customers a complimentary credit monitoring service through Credit Bureau Singapore.Under the service, the bureau will monitor customers' credit reports and alert them of any suspicious activity.The maximum fine for a data breach is $1 million now.But firms can soon be fined more - up to 10 per cent of their annual turnover in Singapore, or $1 million, whichever is higher.The higher fine is slated to take effect at least 12 months from Feb 1 this year.The MyRepublic attack comes after other mobile operators here were impacted by data breaches.Last month, StarHub said that the identity card numbers, mobile numbers and e-mail addresses belonging to nearly 57,200 customers had been leaked online.In February, Singtel revealed that during a breach of Accellion's file-sharing service, which is used by the telco.There were also at least three reported ransomware attacks last month. One affected the personal data and clinical information of The information included names, addresses, identity card numbers, contact details and clinical information such as patients' clinical notes and eye scans, said Eye & Retina Surgeons on Aug 25.On Aug 16, insurer Tokio Marine Insurance Singapore said it was hit by a ransomware attack.It said at the time that there was no indication of a breach of customer information and confidential information of the Tokio Marine Group.On Aug 19, The Business Times reported that Singapore-based tech company Pine Labs fell victim to ransomware too.The firm is a Temasek-backed payments platform.Hackers were said to have stolen confidential documents between Pine Labs and several Indian banks, and held the information hostage.Dr Protassov said the recent increase in data breaches could be due partly to increased use of digital services amid the pandemic, resulting in more data being generated and badly configured databases.There are also more hackers now with more tools at their disposal, and at the same time more instruments to detect cyber attacks which lead to a higher number of cases being reported.“Often times, attackers repeat what worked on one victim against other targets,” said Dr Protassov. “They develop a playbook of successful attacks and apply it at a larger scale whenever possible.”Help us make this ""Follow writer"" feature better.This questionnaire should take no more than a minute to complete.

SINGAPORE - Sale and rental prices of homes near popular primary schools may rise following to help more children secure a place in a school near their home, say property experts.OrangeTee & Tie senior vice-president of research and analytics Christine Sun told The Straits Times that prices of homes near top schools - already high - are likely to rise even more following the Ministry of Education's (MOE) announcement on Thursday (Sept 9).If a school has more applications than vacancies in phase 2C of registration, priority will be given to Singaporeans living closer to the school.Ms Sun said: ""So those who can afford to buy homes near popular schools may stand to benefit from these changes, especially in areas where there are no new Build-To-Order flats and buying or renting resale homes is the only option.""She added that more owners are likely to lease or resell their homes to capitalise on the growing demand.She said: ""Rental and sales of properties have already been very 'hot' in these areas in recent years, especially since balloting by distance is getting prevalent in more schools and across more phases.""According to Ms Sun, prices of resale private properties within 1km of St Hilda's Primary School in Tampines, a popular choice, are about 11 per cent to 12 per cent higher than the district average price this year.Similarly, the cost of resale private properties within 1km of Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) in Barker Road is about 19 per cent higher than the district average price this year.Under the new changes, MOE will double the number of places in phase 2C, which is reserved for pupils with no prior connection to the school, from 20 to 40.In addition, it  - phases 2A(1) and 2A(2) - into a single phase, 2A.With the change, alumni association members will vie with former pupils of the school who are not association members for places.MOE also adjusted the method used for calculating the boundary line of the school, which The ministry said these changes were made in response to rising competition under Phase 2C, and they are intended to enable continued accessibility to and diversity in primary schools.However, experts said these changes are likely to collectively result in increasing rental prices in areas near schools.ERA Realty Network head of research and consultancy Nicholas Mak said more parents would want to move closer to their desired school since greater weight will be given to living closer.High demand is likely to drive rental prices up because most people might not be able to afford buying a home near popular schools, he added.However, property prices might not jump drastically as the revised method of calculating proximity will encompass more homes within 1km and 2km of schools, he said.

"S'pore opens Covid-19 vaccination channels for overseas-based citizens to get jabbed upon arrival - The Straits Times
SINGAPORE - Singapore citizens who are based overseas will find it more convenient to be vaccinated in Singapore, with two new channels to allow them to receive the first Covid-19 vaccine dose upon arrival.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Sept 11) that  allow them to introduce two vaccination channels for overseas Singaporeans arriving via Changi Airport and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.Under the first channel, Singapore citizens can receive the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine upon arrival in Singapore without serving full stay-home notice (SHN).They then return to their resident country on the next available flight or ferry.Individuals can complete their vaccination regimen by repeating this process for their second dose.Under the second channel, Singapore citizens can receive the first dose upon arrival here and complete the full SHN at a dedicated facility.They can then receive the second dose after the required dosing interval before returning to their resident country.But those opting for the second channel will still be subject to the prevailing border measures on the pre-departure test, on-arrival testing regime, as well as length of SHN based on their 21-day travel history.Those choosing the first option will also be subject to prevailing border measures until they depart on the next available flight or ferry.MFA and MOH said: ""Regardless of their country or region of embarkation, the overseas Singaporeans will be required to stay at an appointed dedicated facility where the vaccination will be offered on-site, while they are under SHN.""Currently, returning Singaporeans from category two to four countries or regions will have to serve the full SHN required of them, before they can receive their first dose of vaccination.This is followed by the second dose three to four weeks later.The ministries added: ""For Singaporeans with family and work commitments abroad, this makes it difficult for them to return to Singapore for vaccination given the long duration away from their resident countries.""They said that while the Covid-19 vaccines will be provided by the Singapore Government, the overseas Singaporeans will have to bear the associated costs of returning for the vaccination.This includes accommodation at the designated facility, swab tests and travel expenses.Overseas Singaporeans should register their interest in using either vaccination channel via this website.Before travelling to Singapore, they should obtain the relevant re-entry approvals and return flight or ferry tickets to ensure that they can return to their resident countries after their vaccination.More information on the vaccination channels can be found on MOH's FAQ page.Further information on entry requirements to Singapore for returning citizens can be found on the SafeTravel website.Help us make this ""Follow writer"" feature better.This questionnaire should take no more than a minute to complete.

New U.S. studies released Friday show the COVID-19 vaccines remain highly effective against hospitalizations and death even as the extra-contagious delta variant swept the country.One study tracked over 600,000 COVID-19 cases in 13 states from April through mid-July. As delta surged in early summer, those who were unvaccinated were 4.5 times more likely than the fully vaccinated to get infected, over 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Vaccination works,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC’s director, told a White House briefing Friday. “The bottom line is this: We have the scientific tools we need to turn the corner on this pandemic.”But as earlier data has shown, protection against coronavirus infection is slipping some: It was 91% in the spring but 78% in June and July, the study found.So-called ""breakthrough” cases in the fully vaccinated accounted for 14% of hospitalizations and 16% of deaths in June and July, about twice the percentage as earlier in the year.An increase in those percentages isn’t surprising: No one ever said the vaccines were perfect and health experts have warned that as more Americans get vaccinated, they naturally will account for a greater fraction of the cases.Walensky said Friday that well over 90% of people in U.S. hospitals with COVID-19 are unvaccinated.CDC released two other studies Friday that signaled hints of waning protection for older adults. One examined COVID-19 hospitalizations in nine states over the summer and found protection for those 75 and older was 76% compared to 89% for all other adults. And in five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations was 95% among 18- to 64-year-olds compared to 80% among those 65 and older.It isn't clear if the changes seen over time are because immunity is waning in people first vaccinated many months ago, that the vaccine isn’t quite as strong against delta -- or that much of the country abandoned masks and other precautions just as delta started spreading.But U.S. health authorities will consider this latest real-world data as they decide if at least some Americans need a booster, and how soon after their last dose. Next week, advisers to the Food and Drug Administration will publicly debate Pfizer’s application to offer a third shot.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Get ready for a tense love triangle to form on “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha”!A remake of the film “Mr. Hong,” “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha” is a new tvN romance drama starring Shin Min Ah as Yoon Hye Jin, a dentist who moves from Seoul to the seaside village of Gongjin, and Kim Seon Ho as Hong Doo Shik, an odd-job expert who helps everyone around town.On the previous episode of “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha,” Lee Sang Yi made his first appearance as Ji Sung Hyun, a famous variety show PD (producing director) who happens to know Yoon Hye Jin from school. Before Ji Sung Hyun’s unexpected arrival in Gongjin, Mi Sun (played by Gong Min Jung) pointed the PD out in a magazine article to Hye Jin by saying, “You used to like him.” Although Hye Jin fervently denied it, the incident left viewers wondering what kind of history the two characters had in the past.Newly released stills from the drama’s next episode reveal a glimpse of the personality of Ji Sung Hyun, who will wind up entangled in a love triangle with Yoon Hye Jin and Hong Doo Shik. A talented PD who makes a hit out of every program he works on, the cheerful and friendly Ji Sung Hyun thinks of his work as play and his co-workers as friends.However, despite his seemingly flawless personality, there is one thing Ji Sung Hyun gets unusually sensitive about: food. The PD can’t help getting angry when he’s hungry, and he gets even angrier if he has to eat bad food.In the new photos, Ji Sung Hyun looks incredibly satisfied as he sits in front of a table filled with food. Yet instead of digging into the delicious meal, he suddenly becomes distracted by something on his phone, raising the question of what could keep this normally voracious eater from his food.  Lee Sang Yi teased, “Starting with Sung Hyun’s arrival, a more varied and unique romance story will begin to unfold. I think you can safely look forward to finding out what kind of relationship Hye Jin and Sung Hyun have, as well as [Sung Hyun’s] chaotically cute, fun, and comic friendship with Doo Shik.”To find out how Ji Sung Hyun’s arrival will shake up the village of Gongjin, tune in to the next episode of “Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha” on September 11 at 9 p.m. KST!In the meantime, watch Lee Sang Yi in his previous drama “Youth of May” with subtitles below: Watch Now Source (1)",https://6.viki.io/image/766537ee98744b4e9a03f6d79767a1b8/dummy.jpeg?s=7x5&e=t,"Prince Andrew 'refusing to be served with sexual assault lawsuit' - Yahoo Singapore News

"NASA's Perseverance rover collects puzzle pieces of Mars' history - Yahoo Singapore News
Washington [US], September 11 (ANI): NASA's Perseverance Mars rover successfully collected its first pair of rock samples, and scientists already are gaining new insights into the region.After collecting its first sample, named ""Montdenier"" on September 6, the team collected a second, ""Montagnac,"" from the same rock on September 8, according to a release by NASA.Analysis of the rocks from which the Montdenier and Montagnac samples were taken and from the rover's previous sampling attempt may help the science team piece together the timeline of the area's past, which was marked by volcanic activity and periods of persistent water.""It looks like our first rocks reveal a potentially habitable sustained environment,"" said Ken Farley of Caltech, project scientist for the mission, which is led by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California.""It's a big deal that the water was there a long time.""The rock that provided the mission's first core samples is basaltic in composition and may be the product of lava flows. The presence of crystalline minerals in volcanic rocks is especially helpful in radiometric dating. The volcanic origin of the rock could help scientists accurately date when it formed.Each sample can serve as part of a larger chronological puzzle; put them in the right order, and scientists have a timeline of the most important events in the crater's history. Some of those events include the formation of Jezero Crater, the emergence and disappearance of Jezero's lake, and changes to the planet's climate in the ancient past.""What's more, salts have been spied within these rocks. These salts may have formed when groundwater flowed through and altered the original minerals in the rock, or more likely when liquid water evaporated, leaving the salts. The salt minerals in these first two rock cores may also have trapped tiny bubbles of ancient Martian water. If present, they could serve as microscopic time capsules, offering clues about the ancient climate and habitability of Mars. Salt minerals are also well-known on Earth for their ability to preserve signs of ancient life,"" read the release.The Perseverance science team already knew a lake once filled the crater; for how long has been more uncertain. The scientists couldn't dismiss the possibility that Jezero's lake was a ""flash in the pan"": floodwaters could have rapidly filled the impact crater and dried up in the space of 50 years, for example.But the level of alteration that scientists see in the rock that provided the core samples - as well as in the rock the team targeted on their first sample-acquisition attempt - suggests that groundwater was present for a long timeThe US space agency said this groundwater could have been related to the lake that was once in Jezero, or it could have travelled through the rocks long after the lake had dried up. Though scientists still can't say whether any of the water that altered these rocks was present for tens of thousands or for millions of years, they feel more certain that it was there for long enough to make the area more welcoming to microscopic life in the past.""These samples have high value for future laboratory analysis back on Earth,"" said Mitch Schulte of NASA Headquarters, the mission's program scientist.""One day, we may be able to work out the sequence and timing of the environmental conditions that this rock's minerals represent. This will help answer the big-picture science question of the history and stability of liquid water on Mars,"" the official statement said.Perseverance's next likely sample site is just 656 feet (200 meters) away in ""South Seitah,"" a series of ridges covered by sand dunes, boulders, and rock shards that Farley likens to ""broken dinner plates.""The rover's recent drill sample represents what is likely one of the youngest rock layers that can be found on Jezero Crater's floor. South Seitah, on the other hand, is likely older, and will provide the science team a better timeline to understand events that shaped the crater floor, including its lake, read the release.By the start of October, all Mars missions will be standing down from commanding their spacecraft for several weeks, a protective measure during a period called Mars solar conjunction. Perseverance isn't likely to drill in South Seitah until sometime after that period.

Sure but Inspiration4 is also go for launch in this week's science news - TechRadar
Leading off the post-Labor Day science news this week were a couple of newly-announced launch dates for some historic space flights, as well as a new study that examines how a severe solar storm could trigger a months-long internet apocalypse.Inspiration4 set a tentative launch window for next week while the much-delayed James Webb Space Telescope is finally getting its own launch date for the end of the year.Speaking of space, a new study explored how an uncommon, but inevitable phenomenon caused by the sun could knock large regions or even entire continents off the internet entirely for weeks or even months, and how we need to prepare for the worst now. In the background though was climate change, and specifically how climate change is impacting our world faster than expected and in some surprising ways. A new study found evidence that some animals are growing bigger body parts in response to rising temperatures far faster than scientists realized – but still not fast enough to adapt to a changing climate.Then, there was the disturbing news that California's Dixie Fire is threatening the Allen Telescope Array and forcing an evacuation of its scientists and staff, disrupting the facility's important work in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.All in all, a pretty full week, so let's dig in.Scientists and engineers have been worrying about a major solar storm for a long while now, but a new study by an assistant professor at the University of California, Irvine, spells out some of the .A solar storm – a fairly regular eruption of highly magnetized particles from the sun – isn't dangerous to humans (at least not directly), but it can wreak total havoc on electronics, knocking out entire power grids, and frying electronic devices in areas hit by these particles.What Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi found in the paper she presented to the SIGCOMM 2021 conference last month was that undersea telecommunications cables, the kind we use to connect the world to a single common internet, are especially vulnerable to a severe solar storm, and should we get hit by one, it could knock entire continents like North America and Europe offline for months.There are things we can do to mitigate the threat, though, but we have to act now because once we see a solar storm coming, it's far too late to do anything about it.The much delayed  for later this year, bringing the next generation observatory that much closer to unlocking the mysteries of the early universe.The telescope, now scheduled to launch from a European Space Agency spaceport in French Guiana on December 18, 2021.The space telescope, originally scheduled for an August 2020 launch, will fly into orbit aboard an Adriane 5 rocket, where it will then begin its complex deployment to the second Lagrange point far beyond the moon's orbit and unfurl its mirrors to the universe.Capable of seeing farther than any observatory ever created, the James Webb Space Telescope is expected to find the oldest galaxies ever formed during the early days of the universe. What else will it be able to see? That's what we're about to find out, starting on December 18, 2021.Inspiration4, the first ever all-civilian space flight mission ever attempted,  this week and will take off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket no earlier than 8PM EDT on September 15.Being a preliminary launch window, it is obviously subject to change as conditions evolve, but the historic launch is nearly here. Make sure to bookmark our Inspiration4 page for updates on the launch and for a live stream of the event once it becomes available.In sadder news, a new study has found evidence that animals are responding to the fast-changing climate by  – though this doesn't mean they are adapting to a warmer world.The study looked at warm-blooded animals and found larger beaks on birds and larger ears on mammals than samples taken from the same species decades ago, a product of something known as the Allen rule. According to this rule, animals that evolve in colder climates have shorter limbs and appendages than those that evolved in warmer climates to help regulate body heat.The researchers found that the most pronounced change was in Australian parrots, which saw an increase in beak size between 4% and 10% just since 1871.While 150 might seem like a long time, this is nothing in the usual geological timescales under which evolution operates. Unfortunately, scientists don't believe that these changes are happening fast enough to matter, or that these changes are even helpful for the species survival.There's even more climate change news this week, this time in the form of California's Dixie Fire, the second-largest wildfire on record in the state, which is now threatening to overrun the Allen Telescope Array (ATA).ATA is unique in that its primary function is to listen to the stars for the faint radio signals of alien civilizations, using 42 large radio antennas. These antennas are now under direct threat from the Dixie Fire, which as of the time of this writing is just 12 miles away from the facility and heading towards it.""Anticipating the possibility that [the Dixie Fire] might reach the antennas, the observatory staff contacted the U.S. Forest Service’s Fire Department to prepare the site against eventual damage,"" the . ""Two teams from the Forest Service, about a dozen people in total, removed brush from near the antennas. Trees in the area were pruned of any branches lower than ten feet above the ground.""Here's hoping that disaster is averted for now, but unless we address the climate crisis, anything we do will just delay an even worse reckoning later.John (He / Him / His) is TechRadar's Computing Staff Writer and is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY. Named by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.You can find him online on Twitter at @thisdotjohnCurrently playing: Valheim, Darkest Dungeon, SatisfactoryThank you for signing up to TechRadar.

            It would take 15 billion years for the clock that occupies Jun Ye's basement lab at the University of Colorado to lose a second -- about how long the universe has existed.For this invention, the Chinese-American scientist, along with Hidetoshi Katori of Japan, will split $3 million as co-winners of the 2022 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics.Working independently, the two developed techniques using lasers to trap and cool atoms, then harness their vibrations to drive what are known as ""optical lattice clocks,"" the most precise timekeeping pieces ever built.By comparison, current atomic clocks lose a second once every 100 million years.But what is gained by greater accuracy?""It's really an instrument to allow you to probe the basic fabric of space-time in the universe,"" Ye told AFP.In Ye's lab, researchers have shown that time moves slower when the clock is moved closer to the ground by a matter of centimeters, in line with Einstein's predictions of relativity.Applied to current technology, these clocks could improve GPS navigation accuracy by a factor of a thousand, or help smoothly land an unmanned spaceplane on Mars.A brief history of time Improving the precision and accuracy of timekeeping has been a goal since ancient Egyptians and Chinese made sundials.A key breakthrough came with the invention of the pendulum clock in 1656, which relies on a swinging weight to keep time, and a few decades later chronometers were accurate enough to determine a ship's longitude at sea.Read also: The early 20th century saw the advent of quartz clocks, which when jolted with electricity resonate at very specific, high frequencies, or number of ticks in a second.Quartz clocks are ubiquitous in modern electronics, but are still somewhat susceptible to variations caused by the manufacturing process, or conditions like temperature.The next great leap in timekeeping came from harnessing the movements of energized atoms to develop atomic clocks, which are immune the effects of such environmental variations. Physicists know that a single, very high frequency will cause particles called electrons that orbit the nucleus of a specific type of atom to jump to a higher energy state, finding an orbit further away from the nucleus.Atomic clocks generate the approximate frequency that causes atoms of the element Cesium to jump to that higher energy state. Then, a detector counts the number of those energized atoms, adjusting the frequency if necessary to make the clock more precise. So precise that since 1967, one second has been defined as 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a Cesium atom. Exploring the universe, and Earth Katori's and Ye's labs have found ways to improve atomic clocks even further by moving oscillations to the visible end of the electromagnetic spectrum, with frequencies a hundred thousand times higher than those used in current atomic clocks -- to make them even more accurate.They realized they needed a way to trap the atoms -- in this case, of the element strontium -- and hold them still with ultralow temperatures to help measure time properly. Read also: If the atoms are falling due to gravity or are otherwise moving, there would be a loss of accuracy, and relativity would cause distorting effects on the timekeeping. To trap the atoms, the inventors created an ""optical lattice"" made by laser waves moving in opposite directions to form a stationary, egg carton-like shape.Ye is excited about the potential use of his clock. For example, synchronizing the clocks of the world's best observatories down to the tiniest fractions of a second would allow astronomers to better conceptualize black holes. Better clocks can also shed new light on the Earth's geological processes.Relativity tells us that time slows down when it approaches a massive body, so a sufficiently accurate clock could tell scientists the difference between solid rock and volcanic lava below the surface, helping to predict an eruption.Or indeed, measure the levels of the oceans, or how much water flows beneath a desert.The next great challenge, Ye says, will be miniaturizing the technology so it can be moved out of a lab.The scientist admits it's sometimes hard to explain fundamental physics concepts to the public.""But when they hear about clocks, they can feel it's a tangible thing, they can make a connection to that, and that's very rewarding,"" he said. 2016 - 2021 PT.

Not all caterpillars grow up to be beautiful butterflies. Some become living milkshakes for their dads, who guzzle caterpillar body fluids to attract the ladies.Recently, scientists reported the first evidence of butterflies sipping from the bodies of caterpillars — dead and alive. They observed adult milkweed butterflies in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, using tiny claws on their feet to scratch wounds in caterpillars' bodies so they could lap the liquid that oozed out. Male butterflies seek certain compounds produced by milkweed (flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae), which repel predators and help the butterflies produce pheromones that attract females. Since caterpillars are stuffed with juices from chewed-up plants, they make an easy target for butterflies looking to chemically boost their attractiveness to females. Related: ""The caterpillar larvae would contort their bodies rapidly in what appeared to be futile attempts to deter the persistent scratching of adults,"" said the researchers who observed the butterfly baby-drinking. They described their observations in a study published Sept. 8 in the journal Ecology.Butterflies in the Danainae family are known as milkweed butterflies because most of the caterpillars in this group feed on milkweed plants, which contain toxic alkaloids that are absorbed by the caterpillars and then processed into useful chemicals that protect them from predators. Another use for these alkaloids is in mating pheromones, which are transferred to females in the males' sperm packet ""as a nuptial gift,"" the scientists wrote.Most milkweed butterfly species are found in Asia, but four species live in North America, one of which is the colorful monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), . Male butterflies in this family are known for a unique behavior called leaf-scratching, in which adults supplement the plant sap they absorbed as hungry caterpillars by scraping at milkweed leaves with their tiny claws to release alkaloid-loaded sap for drinking through their long proboscis. Sometimes males gather by the hundreds to scratch and sip on milkweed leaves, according to the study.But on Dec. 9, 2019, lead study author Yi-Kai Tea, a doctoral candidate in the University of Sydney's School of Life and Environmental Sciences, and co-author Jonathan Soong Wei, a naturalist in Singapore, saw milkweed butterflies in Indonesia's Tangkoko Batuangus Nature Reserve that were scratching at a different sap-loaded source: live milkweed caterpillars.""Multiple adults were observed scratching many caterpillars along a stretch of coastal vegetation"" that spanned more than 1,600 feet (500 meters), the researchers reported. They then saw the butterflies actively drink ""from the wounded and oozing caterpillars"" for hours, with the butterflies sometimes gathering in mixed-species groups. So intent were the butterflies on drinking from the caterpillars that not even the touch of a human observer could distract them, the study authors wrote. To describe the behavior, the scientists coined the term ""kleptopharmacophagy,"" which means ""consuming stolen chemicals.""""The alternative neologisms 'kairopharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from wounded caterpillars detected via 'eavesdropping') or 'necropharmacophagy' (feeding on defensive chemicals from dead caterpillars) might also be appropriate,"" the researchers reported.— ——Over three days, the scientists counted seven species of milkweed butterflies that scraped and sipped living and dead caterpillars (it is unknown if the dead caterpillars were drunk to death or died of their wounds). One possible explanation for why the butterflies find caterpillars so delicious is because milkweed alkaloids accumulate in the caterpillars' bodies from the leaves that they eat, making their internal ""juices"" a more potent, alkaloid-rich brew — and thereby more attractive to thirsty males, the scientist suggested. It's likely that the butterflies are drawn to milkweed leaves that are already damaged from caterpillar chewing; those caterpillars would be close by when the adults start scratching. If a butterfly accidentally scrapes a caterpillar, the wound would release a heady chemical scent that would attract the butterfly and encourage it to scratch the caterpillar even more, according to the study. Many questions remain about this unusual (and ghastly) behavior, such as which specific plant compounds attract the butterflies to the caterpillars and do butterflies in other parts of the world also practice baby-drinking, Tea said in a statement. ""These simple observations raise questions about the ecology of these well-known butterflies, providing numerous opportunities for future studies,"" he said.Originally published on Live Science.Mindy Weisberger is a Live Science senior writer covering a general beat that includes climate change, paleontology, weird animal behavior, and space.

Space technology is complicated. Whether it’s a crewed spaceship or a large structure like the International Space Station (ISS), when astronauts need to maintain or replace certain components it’s never a simple task. Currently, repairs like those performed on the ISS are overseen by staff on the ground, who have access to all the schematics and information about the components and instruct astronauts on what to do, one step at a time.But for future missions, especially those eventually venturing out further into the solar system such as to Mars, there will be a significant communications delay between Earth and the astronauts which makes this approach impractical. Astronauts will need to be able to make repairs or changes by themselves, without so much immediate guidance from the ground. To help with this, astronauts on the ISS are testing out a new Augmented Reality (AR) system which can help in the inspection and maintenance of station equipment.The T2 Augmented Reality project uses familiar consumer hardware like Microsoft HoloLens AR googles plus specially-developed NASA software to give astronauts guidance and instructions for performing tasks like inspecting scientific equipment or maintaining on-station exercise equipment. The idea is to load up the software with instructions for various operations which the crew can access when they need it.“AR tools hold the promise of allowing us to pre-package guidance and expertise,” said International Space Station associate scientist Bryan Dansberry at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. “The space station is the perfect platform to test out AR systems and refine these tools so they will be ready when future astronauts need them. Closer to home, these tests help to mature software and AR technology now so expertise and support are available in remote locations around the world.”So far, the system has been tested by JAXA astronaut Soichi Noguchi, who used it to maintain the space station’s treadmill, and by European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Pesquet and NASA astronaut Megan McArthur. The crew is planning another nine test sessions to try out the procedure and learn more about what does and doesn’t work. For now, the system will be used only for the treadmill, but in the future, this approach could be used to maintain other pieces of equipment and could even be used by astronauts traveling to the moon or Mars.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png
"What we expect from next week’s Apple event - Yahoo Singapore News
We’ve been scouring the latest rumors and leaks and playing all of The Mamas and The Papas songs forward and backward to get the best possible picture of what we’re in store for with next Tuesday’s “California Streaming’” event.The invites, which went out a week in advance, don’t appear to give the game away here. There was some extremely cool AR trickery, accessible through Safari on mobile, which could point to some fancy camera upgrades, though augmented reality has become a bit of a staple on these invites.The California Streaming title, meanwhile, seems likely to be more of a nod to the all-virtual nature of the event, rather than anything to do with, say, Apple TV (of course, we’ve been one-more-thinged in the past). And as for that lovely shot of the Sierras — that could well be a nod to macOS, though the company has moved onto Monterey. It seems just as likely to be a reference to the aforementioned title.The biggest, simplest and most important answer to the question of what to expect is a new iPhone. Last year’s models saw a notable delay due to COVID-19-related supply chain bottlenecking. Supply chain problems have persisted, of course, but by all accounts, the company appears to be back on track with its pre-pandemic release cycle.The iPhone 12’s biggest upgrade was, of course, the long-awaited addition of 5G. That, coupled with the delay, led Apple to some pretty massive sales quarters amid a broader stalling of the overall mobile market. While other manufacturers have skipped the number out of superstitious concerns, Apple seems firmly on board with iPhone 13 (even as renders of its successor, the iPhone 14 have reportedly already leaked).Image Credits: Getty Images / Qi Heng/VCGRecent reports suggest that the iPhone 13 will arrive in four different configurations — much like its predecessor. So: the iPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. The screen sizes should remain the same: 5.4, 6.1 (x2) and 6.7 inches. A separate report, meanwhile, suggests that we’ll see additional colors, with the full lineup being black, white, blue, purple, pink (rather than green) and Product (Red). But, keep in mind that offering different color availabilities in different markets isn’t entirely out of the question.Unsurprisingly, camera upgrades appear to be the biggest news here. Word from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is that last year’s Pro Max model specs will graduate to the rest of the line (including, potentially, lidar). A ProRes video mode is said to be following the addition of ProRAW to further advance the handset’s bonafides as a semi-pro video shooting rig. Cinematic Video, meanwhile, is said to bring a Portrait-mode-style effect to video. Kuo has also suggested that the devices will be getting a feature based on the Qualcomm X60 that allows for emergency satellite calls — reportedly only available in select markets.Of course, the phone will also be getting Apple’s latest chip, the A15, said to be coupled with 120 Hz ProMotion display. Apple could also be bringing an always-on feature to the screen, hopefully with minimal impact on battery life. Looks-wise we anticipate it will be more or less the same as its predecessor, albeit with a somewhat smaller camera notch up front — though not to the point of the fake Ted Lasso iPhone. The camera bump around back, meanwhile, is said to be getting larger, perhaps offering an improved telephoto lens.Oh, and apparently they’ll be  than the iPhone 12 — clearly not one of the new features Apple is going to be actively promoting.Image Credits: AppleThe Apple Watch 7 seems destined to be the other big news of the event. Apple’s massively popular wearable is reportedly set to get more massive, with a larger display, resulting in a slightly larger case size, from 40 mm and 44 mm to 41 mm and 45 mm. The overall size won’t be too large a change, however, as the company is said to be reducing its bezels this go-round.Perhaps the most exciting rumor around the Watch is the addition of significant battery life. That’s long felt like a blind spot for the product, compared to competing smartwatches — particularly after Apple significantly improved sleep tracking. Most aren’t anticipating major new health features for the Watch this outing, which is a bit of a surprise here, given that health and fitness have been a major cornerstone for Apple.Image Credits: TechCrunchAirPods 3 seem like a reasonably good bet. The latest version of the company’s entry-level earbuds (and their case) are said to be getting a more Pro-style redesign, along with a new chip that’s designed to improve battery life. Active noise cancelation and replaceable tips are apparently not going to make an appearance to maintain the distinction between the two models.With the company’s rangewide upgrade to its own silicon chugging along, don’t be surprised if we see a number of new Macs. Rumors suggest a new MacBook Pro, Mac Mini and a larger, 27-inch version of its ARM-powered iMac.The event kicks off Tuesday, September 14 at 10 a.m. PDT/1 p.m. EDT. We’ll be here, bringing you the news as it arrives.", https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1583248045.jpg,"Why Windows 11 is more than just a Windows 10 reskin - Digital Trends
Windows 11 is, for the most part, a visual update to Windows 10. It’s the same operating system under the hood, just with new features and an updated look. Despite being built on the same OS, Microsoft has said that Windows 11 will feature various optimizations, and now, we know what those optimizations are.In a video posted by Microsoft Mechanics (Microsoft’s official YouTube channel for IT professionals), Steve Dispensa, vice president of enterprise management, detailed how Windows 11 goes beyond being a reskin.CPU optimizations look to make the most difference in how Windows 11 feels. This comes down to how Windows 11 manages cores and threads, prioritizing foreground applications even when the CPU is under load. In the video, an example is shown with 90% CPU utilization, which would normally slow down launching new apps. Because the load is in the background, Windows 11 prioritizes the launching apps in the foreground to help them launch faster.This is something we learned about with the announcement of Intel Thread Director. This upcoming feature on Alder Lake processors assigns tasks to the proper core to speed up the machine. It seems that functionality is baked into Windows 11, as well as some of its apps. Microsoft Edge, for example, has Sleeping Tabs that can reduce memory usage by 32% on average, according to Microsoft.The video details various other optimizations, including faster resume from sleep, faster Windows Hello logins, and expanded compression usage for a smaller disk footprint. The interesting news is how Microsoft is handling Windows 11 updates.Each year, Windows 11 will receive a big features update. That’s a shift from Windows 10, which has received two feature updates each year. We’re not sure why Microsoft is going with the annual route this time around, but it’s presumably to pack more into each update to make them feel more substantial.You’ll get fewer feature updates, but they’ll have a longer life cycle. For Windows 11 Home and Pro, Microsoft is offering 24 months of updates instead of the 18 months available on Windows 10. If you don’t move to the new features update within two years, you’ll lose out on security updates.Updates should be much faster on Windows 11, too. Instead of downloading the entire update, Windows 11 compares what you already have on your machine to what’s in the update. According to Microsoft, that reduces update sizes by about 40%, which you can automatically apply in hours when you’re not active.Windows 11 is set to roll out on October 5. Although that’s the official release date, eligible PCs may not receive the update right away. Microsoft is rolling out updates in waves, and it expects to wrap up the transition in mid-2022. To run Windows 11, you need a AMD Ryzen 2000 or Intel 8th-gen processor or newer, TPM 2.0, and UEFI Secure Boot. You’ll also need 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.Although the official Windows 11 release is coming in less than a month, it won’t have all of its features. Microsoft has suggested that Android app support won’t be available at launch, which was one of the most anticipated Windows 11 features.", https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1583248045.jpg
"Singapore intensifies testing in response to Covid-19 wave in the community - The Star Online
SINGAPORE, Sept 11 (Bernama): Singapore is intensifying its testing programme to pick up Covid-19 cases early in response to the current Covid-19 infection wave in the community, according to the republic’s multi-ministry taskforce (MTF) on Covid-19.At the current trajectory, the MTF said ""it is likely that we will soon reach more than 1,000 daily cases, detected early through intensified testing.”MTF noted that the current infection wave began on Aug 23 and this is the first time the republic is experiencing such an exponentially rising wave of infection in the community.On Sept 9, Singapore detected a total of 450 community cases of Covid-19 infection.The MTF said the number of daily cases has been rising over the past fortnight, from an average of 76 cases per day a fortnight ago to 288 cases per day in the past week.At a virtual press conference today, the MTF co-chair who is also the republic’s Trade and Industry Minister, Gan Kim Yong, said ""the sharp rate of increase is worrying.”""Although our vaccination rate has now surpassed that of many countries and is one of the highest in the world, we want to be sure that the number of cases does not suddenly spike which can lead to more serious cases and which in turn, overwhelm our healthcare system.""Therefore we want to be cautious and give ourselves more time to be certain that the high number of daily cases will not result in a high number of serious cases or deaths,” he said.Gan said the next two to four weeks is therefore crucial for Singapore ""as we will find out if patients eventually develop serious illnesses and complications, subsequently.”""We are using the next few weeks to give us time to monitor the number of serious cases, ramp up our testing capacity, and continue to increase our vaccination coverage. This will allow us to move forward with more confidence in time to come,” he said.""As we enter more uncharted waters in the coming days, we will need to step up testing and make it a key part of our strategy, in our journey towards COVID-19 resilience,” he said.Gan noted that testing is also important for businesses as infections that are caught early are less likely to see large clusters which, in turn, create severe disruptions to businesses operations.For now, the MTF said the number of serious cases remains low.As of Sept 9, there are 26 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and seven in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU).The MTF noted that there continues to be strong evidence that vaccination provided protection against severe illness.Among fully vaccinated cases in the past 28 days, the MTF said 99.2 per cent were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms while among unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals, 95.1 per cent were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.As of Sept 8, 81 per cent of Singapore’s population has completed their full regimen/received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 83 per cent has received at least one dose. - Bernama   Report it to us.Thank you for your report!Copyright  1995-

SINGAPORE - Shortly after Sept 11, 2001, a man's support for Al-Qaeda aroused the suspicions of a Singaporean Muslim who tipped off the Internal Security Department (ISD).But the man, Mohammad Aslam Yar Ali Khan, left abruptly for Pakistan and then Afghanistan, where Northern Alliance forces arrested him in November that year.The ISD, which had been watching those around him, stepped in to arrest 15 people a month later, disrupting their plans to mount attacks here and uncovering clandestine terror group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which sought to establish a regional caliphate through violence.Aslam was repatriated to Singapore. He remains in detention,  But several dozen others have been released after undergoing rehabilitation and turning their backs on extremism.Plots to attack Changi Airport, Marina Bay Sands and soft targets have also been foiled.Two decades after the Sept 11, 2001 terror attacks on America, but other forms of violent extremism have broadened the terrorism threat here, the ISD says.A spokesman for the department says a spike in self-radicalisation cases since 2015 means that ""softer"" approaches, beyond beefing up security responses, have become even more important. These include improving digital literacy and critical thinking skills among youth, as well as growing an awareness of online radicalisation. Strengthening social resilience remains key.The Sept 11 attacks heralded a new wave of transnational terrorism, with direct security implications for Singapore, says ISD.While it saw foreign terrorists hijack the ferry Laju in 1974 and Singapore Airlines Flight 117 in 1991, plots by JI against foreign embassies and key installations uncovered in 2001 marked the first time ""a small, isolated group of misguided fellow Singaporeans were willing to resort to violence within Singapore to advance their extremist beliefs"", the agency adds.Decisive security action here and in the region meant that over the years, lone actors took on greater prominence compared with organised groups. In 2007, the first self-radicalised Singaporean was dealt with under the Internal Security Act (ISA).In the mid-2010s, the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and its savvy use of social media saw a spike in radicalisation cases.ISD's Singapore Terrorism Threat Assessment Report, released in June, notes that 54 people have been dealt with under the ISA for terror-linked conduct since 2015, and 44 of them - 32 Singaporeans and 12 foreigners - were self-radicalised.The threat to Singapore remains shaped by global developments such as tensions or attacks abroad.Dr Samir Puri, a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says that technology has enabled the shift towards self-radicalised individuals.""There are more traps for a lost individual spending time doom-scrolling down the Internet, accidentally finding ideas that are very negative, very poisonous and how these reflect their own personal grievances,"" he says, referring to the act of spending an excessive amount of time online.Deviant ideologies that attract such individuals - in online forums, social media and the Dark Web - have expanded to include those espoused by far-right movements elsewhere.Last December, a 16-year-old Protestant Christian became the first ISD detainee to be influenced by far-right ideology. He was planning to attack two mosques here, on the second anniversary of the Christchurch terror attack that killed 51 worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand in 2019.Experts say that far-right extremism, with its origins in white supremacist thinking, holds little traction in this part of the world, but its broader messages of ethno-religious chauvinism and anti-immigration sentiment can still appeal to hardline groups, says Dr Puri.""There might be people who take a very negative, very oppositional, possibly even violent view towards having a multi-ethnic country.""Associate Professor Kumar Ramakrishna, who heads the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), notes that in South-east Asia, the key issue might be Islamophobia, layered with troubled individual youth psychology and motivations.RSIS senior fellow Raffaello Pantucci argues that these factors could be more vital than narratives around ideology and identity.The ISD says that should the threat of far-right extremism escalate, the Government is confident that it can count on religious and community organisations to step forward and work together in the same way the Religious Rehabilitation Group (RRG) has.The group was formed by Islamic teachers in 2003 to counsel JI detainees and has expanded its ambit to steer those influenced by radical teachings away from such teachings.The Sept 11 attacks inspired the inclusion of various strategies to counter terrorism, notes Dr Jolene Jerard, the executive director at public safety and management consultancy Centinel.These include starting the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles to foster better understanding and goodwill among communities, and the Community Engagement Programme (CEP) to build resilience and ensure that a flashpoint like a terror attack does not rupture the social fabric.The CEP, started in 2006 to build social cohesion and resilience against terrorism, was revamped as SGSecure a decade later to sensitise, train and mobilise the community. It has held workshops on life-saving skills, conducted exercises simulating terror attacks, and developed a smartphone app for reporting suspicious activities.The Ministry of Home Affairs says it has seen positive results from the CEP and SGSecure, with most people agreeing that they have a role to play in preventing and dealing with a terror attack.But one area that needs work is the early reporting of suspected cases of radicalisation. A 2019 survey found that only about half of respondents said they would contact the authorities if they believed their relative or friend was displaying signs of radicalisation.Counter-terrorism efforts must address radicalisation upstream, says the ISD, highlighting how the fight against terror has remained, at its core, an ideological battle against violent extremist beliefs.Prof Ramakrishna says there has been a recognition that there must be a ""softer"" dimension in these efforts. This includes countering extremist ideology online and detainee rehabilitation, involving psychologists and moderate scholars, he says, citing the RRG as an example.Irrespective of the form of extremism, the Internet and social media have remained the primary, prevalent means of radicalisation.The online space facilitates the process, from the introduction to radical ideas, to further ""research"" to affirm one's beliefs, to groups and platforms clustering the like-minded together, says the ISD.Professor Andrew Tan from the department of security studies at Sydney's Macquarie University says that amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the online spread of misinformation and extremist ideas makes them easily available to ""legions of disaffected searching for answers to the troubling conundrums and uncertainties in today's world"".Officials and experts agree that policing the Internet by blocking access to content is not the most effective or sustainable way. Banning undesirables from platforms would drive them to new, less-regulated alternatives, in an unending game of whack-a-mole.ISD says the onus is on social media and technology companies to step up and disrupt terrorist exploitation of their platforms.""They have also been working with religious and community organisations to guide users in navigating the digital space, and positively influence the online discourse,"" the department adds.Impressionable youth are among the prime targets for recruitment and radicalisation.Since 2015, at least seven of the people ISD picked up for terror-related conduct were aged between 16 and 19. By comparison, the youngest people dealt with following the JI terror plots in 2001 were 20 and 21.Prof Ramakrishna is not surprised about this. He says: ""They are still emotionally maturing, looking for black-and-white certainty in a world of many shades of grey. Extremist ideologies purveyed by charismatic figures... meet this need for absolutist, psychological security.""Factors like the effectiveness of social structures are worth examining too, says Mr Pantucci.He and Prof Tan highlight how more efforts relating to mental health could help prevent people, including youth, from being radicalised.Prof Tan says: ""There is also growing awareness... of the need to pay greater attention to mental health, which could lead some to embrace extremist ideologies.""Singapore's model of rehabilitating would-be terrorists is well regarded internationally and is studied by other countries as a ""humane and considered"" way for dealing with terrorism, he adds.Experts say that Singapore has worked hard to keep the terrorist threat at bay here post-9/11 by developing both security and social structures in tandem.""There has been a strong focus on community engagement and dialogue to maintain racial and religious harmony and mitigate the effects of any terrorist attack,"" says Prof Tan.MHA says that while the terrorism threat or risk could change over time, SGSecure's call to action for the community to ""stay alert, stay united and stay strong"" remains consistent, and a vigilant, prepared and cohesive community is Singapore's best defence.""It will never be possible to completely shield society from all these ideas,"" says Prof Tan.""However, Singapore's approach in community engagement, education and rehabilitation would work to minimise the risk, so long as there is awareness that violent extremism can emanate from a variety of sources.""Help us make this ""Follow writer"" feature better.This questionnaire should take no more than a minute to complete.

With a five-day-old infant on board, we had to take special care of them,"" the specialist told the media on Saturday (Sept 11), a day after returning to Singapore.The specialist was part of a 77-person crew, including air crew, pilots, engineers and security personnel, deployed on the humanitarian mission.She and other crew members interviewed for this story have not been named due to confidentiality concerns.Her role on the mission was to act as a chaperone for the evacuees and serve as cabin crew on board the RSAF's A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT), a tanker aircraft with the capacity to carry more than 37 tonnes.The aircraft left Singapore on Aug 26 and returned on Friday after ferrying about 2,200 Afghan evacuees from Qatar to Germany over 10 trips.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had  on Aug 23, during US Vice-President Kamala Harris' visit to Singapore.One of the pilots who flew the aircraft on five of the 10 trips and served as detachment commander on the mission said it was his first time participating in a humanitarian mission.""Managing the crew's fatigue was my main concern because of the long hours,"" said the 40-year-old pilot, adding that the crew was split into two teams to manage the high tempo of the missions.""On one of the missions, for operational reasons, we pushed ourselves to the limit and conducted a 32-hour mission. We flew from Germany to Qatar, picked up the evacuees, took them to Germany and returned to Qatar again, all in one mission.""The usual round trips were also challenging, taking about 21 hours to complete, including a seven-hour flight each way.The commander of the security team, 37, said each trip involved careful preparations, starting with a security screening process to ensure no dangerous items were brought on board, said the commander of the security team.The passengers were then escorted onto the plane, which was set up much like a commercial passenger aircraft.

""Some of our tasks included pre-flight security checks like baggage and personnel screening, as well as providing security aboard the aircraft during the flight from Qatar to Germany,"" he said.Once the aircraft landed, it would be refuelled and thoroughly cleaned for the next batch of crew and passengers to prevent any Covid-19 transmission.In a Facebook post on Friday, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen thanked the crew for carrying out the mission successfully.""They flew Singapore's flag high, being the only foreign military supporting the US' evacuation efforts in Qatar. I know that many Singaporeans share my pride and appreciation for their contributions to this successful mission,"" he said.The air crew specialist said the experience was a memorable one despite the challenges and she felt honoured to be a part of it.""I felt satisfied because I knew that every passenger we ferried was being transported to a safe place to have a new start in life,"" she said.""This mission also served as a reminder to me that we shouldn't take our nation's safety, peace and security for granted.""Help us make this ""Follow writer"" feature better.This questionnaire should take no more than a minute to complete.

[UPDATE Sept 11, 3pm] Ang Mo Kio Town Council told AsiaOne that during the overnight operation at Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4 market on Thursday (Sept 9), one rat and two shrews were culled. No rat burrows were found. shrews are insectivores and are not implicated as vectors that transmit diseases.Ang Mo Kio Town Council added that 62 cages were placed within and outside the market common areas.Authorities have stepped up a notch using alcohol, snares and other traps to lure rodents out during an overnight operation on Thursday (Sept 9) in a market at Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4. Conducted by the National Environment Agency and Ang Mo Kio Town Council, the six-hour extermination exercise ended at 3am. Speaking to reporters from Shin Min Daily News, a spokesperson from Ang Mo Kio Town Council said efforts will be made to ensure cleanliness of the market. Measures include cleaning of public areas and clearing the trash four times a day, and washing the floors daily. The market will also be closed quarterly for spring cleaning. This recent operation will be a relief to stall owners who have reported rat sightings in recent months. In an interview with the Chinese evening daily, a stall owner named Wang, 70, claimed rats would ‘patronise’ his stall everyday. He added that some of them were even ""bigger than cats"". The frustrated stall owner said he had set up cages, but since the rats were too physically strong, they were able to escape from the traps with ease – he only managed to catch two in the past three months.“The rats usually appear in the evening and would scurry around the stall booth. Sometimes, I can also see them early in the morning,” he told the publication. “Besides ruining the fruits and vegetables, they would chew off the cartons.”Another stall owner named Gao told reporters she had seen traces of rat droppings around the area. “To prevent this problem, we’ve to ensure that our stall is clean, and all our goods are placed neatly,” she said. In April,  was reported in the media. Seven to eight rats were seen scurrying on the vegetables, the report said.READ ALSO: chingshijie@asiaone.com",https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_image/public/original_images/Sep2021/20210909_rats.jpg?itok=YB6h2-n_
