"Nerveless world No.1 Ko Jin-young clinches HSBC Women's World Championship on final hole - Yahoo Singapore News
SINGAPORE — For 71 holes over four days, Ko Jin-young played steadily, making few mistakes and staying close to the leading bunch of golfers at the HSBC Women's World Championship.And the world No.1 female golfer saved the best for last, launching a spectacular charge with five birdies in the final six holes at Sentosa Golf Club's New Tanjong Course to win the prestigious tournament on the 72nd and final hole on Sunday (6 March).A six-under-par 66 barely told the story of how the 26-year-old South Korean seemingly fell out of contention after a bogey on the 12th hole, but held her nerve to rein in leader Lee Jeong-eun and finally pip her compatriot for a 17-under total of 271.""When I bogeyed at the 12th hole, I was angry with myself. So I told myself I needed to make as many birdies as possible. Getting one on the next hole was important, and I got lucky on the next few holes,"" Ko said after her win.""I told myself that I had to make a birdie at the last hole, because I didn't want to go into a playoff with a great player like Jeong-eun. It's great that I managed to do so and win.""Heading into the 18th tied with Lee at 16-under, Ko made no mistake with her approach shot to set up a birdie opportunity, while Lee - who had been superb all day with five birdies - found the bunker with her second shot.Meanwhile, Ko kept her cool and duly birdied her putt to clinch her sixth LPGA title in her last 10 outings. She also broke her own LPGA record of 15 consecutive rounds in the 60s, underlining her credentials as the current dominant female golfer.""I like this sort of pressure situations, needing to perform at my best to win,"" Ko said. ""I like to experience and learn from these situations.""Overnight leader Chun In-gee stayed in contention for much of Sunday's round, but missed a glorious eagle opportunity at the par-five 16th which could have seen her draw level with Ko and Lee, as her putt lipped around the hole.She nonetheless finished in second place with a three-under 69 for a 15-under total of 273, tied with Australia's Minjee Lee, who shot the best round of the tournament with a nine-under 63.“It was a tough game for me during this week because I had a spasm in my neck. I’m not happy, but still I'm proud I made the top two because I tried my best,"" Chun said. ""Jin-young made some really good shots and good putts. She showed me why she's the No.1. I was really happy to play with the world’s best players like Jin Young and Jeongeun today.""Singapore’s Koh Sock Hwee finished with a one-over 73 to finish at 15-over 303.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/R25LV0.OipBu35baqalvoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/04f28a70-9d19-11ec-9eb7-832892b4ec5d,"Man City are everything Man United should aspire to be, as latest derby drubbing further proves - ESPN
Alexis Nunes and Janusz Michallik discuss Manchester United's devastating loss to Manchester City. (1:45)MANCHESTER, England -- David Moyes was once ridiculed for saying that Manchester United should aspire to be like Manchester City, but the former United manager was right when he said it in 2014 and it still rings true today, following  -- 4-1 this time -- which restored the champions' six-point lead over Liverpool at the top of the Premier League.Two goals apiece from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez -- Jadon Sancho had earlier equalised after De Bruyne's opener -- gave City a comfortable victory that was much more emphatic than the score line suggests. At one point during the second half, City amassed 92% of possession during a 15-minute period as United's players were tormented by the 'oles' of the home supporters.United were humiliated, with former captains Gary Neville and Roy Keane lambasting the performance in their roles as TV pundits. Neville said United ""finished like an absolute shower"" and ""were a disgrace in the last 25 minutes,"" while Keane accused Ralf Rangnick's players of a ""shameful"" performance. ""They gave up,"" Keane said.Such condemnation is becoming a recurring theme whenever United play against a major rival. Already this season, they have lost 5-0 at home to Liverpool and then lost 2-0 against City at Old Trafford in a game that could have -- and maybe should have -- ended with Pep Guardiola's team winning by an even bigger margin than Liverpool.There was once a time when United ruthlessly defeated their rivals on a regular basis, back in the days when Sir Alex Ferguson's team won 13 titles in 20 years. But those days are gone and Guardiola said after this game that United's decline is a warning to City and all other clubs who think their dominance will never end.""United couldn't expect a decade ago so many years without titles,"" Guardiola said. ""But this is a lesson we must learn too. You can't believe you are so good that what happened to United can't happen.""- O'Hanlon, Ogden: Man United's next manager

""I remember AC Milan, so many Champions Leagues and titles and then they have been so many years without playing in Europe. When I was a teenager, the team of Arrigo Sacchi was the best in the world, but it doesn't matter how big you are, it can happen.""It is a statistical anomaly that United had won four of their previous seven games against City prior to this defeat, but those victories never amounted to anything tangible. City, meanwhile, just continued to win titles. In contrast, United's last trophy came in 2017.City are consistently exceptional. Their players perform to a clear plan constructed by Guardiola and his coaches, and they have a squad stocked with supremely talented players who are prepared to work harder than their opponents whenever they play.United have a squad that cost almost as much as City's, but while the Blues get value for money, the Reds just throw it away by paying over the odds, repeatedly, for mediocre players. The likes of Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire wouldn't come close to City's squad, but their collective transfer fees amount to a staggering £165 million, so it's not as if United have done anything on the cheap in recent years.When Moyes made his remarks, it was following a 3-0 derby defeat at home to City in March 2014, when United were reigning champions, which ultimately helped the Blues beat Liverpool to the title that season. Moyes was fired within a month and United's tailspin of different managers and under-performing players continues, eight years on.Where United have chopped and changed, City have enjoyed the stability of having Guardiola in charge for the last six years. Manuel Pellegrini was manager for three years prior to that, so there is a thread of consistency at City, which now shows itself on the pitch, where the players perform as if on auto-pilot. Their passing is unerringly accurate and they know how to win.And they have players like De Bruyne, who has become as influential a midfielder in the Premier League as the likes of Keane, Patrick Vieira, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard before him.United had no answer to De Bruyne in this game, with Fred and Scott McTominay ill-equipped to stop him. Paul Pogba, who has been at United as long as Guardiola has been at City, only with vastly different results, shone at times and delivered an exquisite pass for Sancho's goal, before being substituted in the second half after running out of steam.City's players don't run out of steam, but winning teams tend to be blessed with players who are prepared to run all day.That's what United lacked at the Etihad, and not for the first time this season. They have a group of players who can't be relied upon when the going gets tough, and whoever is appointed as the club's next permanent manager in the summer faces a mammoth challenge to get United competing again.But the new boss won't have to look far for the perfect example of what a successful team looks like. Just like Moyes said, City are the team to aspire to.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Manchester United's Ralf Rangnick defends effort level in Manchester City rout - ESPN

After Liverpool beat West Ham United this weekend, Jürgen Klopp was emphatic when asked about the reasons behind his team still being capable of winning the quadruple this season. ""We have Divock Origi, we have Taki Minamino, we had Xherdan Shaqiri — all brilliant players who helped us to win the things we won in the past,"" Klopp explained. ""But we needed to bring in quality and fresh energy and that is what we tried — and it looked like it worked out. We have proper quality and depth, and we cannot go far in these competitions if you don't have that depth. There is no chance. ""We cannot play this game [against West Ham] with no changes — there is no chance."" Liverpool's squad depth has been the catalyst for their success this season. As had previously been outlined here, Klopp's attitude to the domestic cups has not altered; only the quality of the players he can now call upon when making wholesale changes. In every top squad around the world, there are far more than the starting XI players who exist: there is another starting XI or more waiting in reserve, and often not waiting all that long. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is a player who falls into the 'squad' rather than 'starting XI' category these days. There was a time when he was in the first team each week and was in top form, but injuries since then and Liverpool moving to another level have changed that. ""[He has had] injury problems. He is now, what 28? His career has stalled over the last years. He has been left behind a little bit. But he's a quality player,"" Roy Keane said on ITV Sport after Liverpool beat Norwich to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals. In one sense, Oxlade-Chamberlain has been left behind. That would have been the case even without injuries: Thiago Alcântara would still have been an upgrade, for example, and Harvey Elliott would still be a prodigy. But just because Oxlade-Chamberlain has fallen down the pecking order does not mean that he will definitely leave the club this summer in search of more regular minutes.For Klopp, having a player who can deputise in midfield, on the right wing and even through the middle as a central striker is no bad thing — not least with another versatile option in James Milner potentially moving on. Oxlade-Chamberlain has made 17 Premier League appearances to date this season. He has made a further five in the domestic cups and another six in the Champions League. In total, that is four more than Roberto Firmino, six more than Naby Keïta and eight more than Thiago. It remains possible that Oxlade-Chamberlain might decide that he needs to be playing regularly as he turns 29 in the summer and he may want to move on in order to achieve that.It is also possible that Liverpool might decide that he is the sellable asset they want to cash in on with a younger midfielder brought in instead. With his contract expiring in 2023, that cannot be ruled out.But it is also more than feasible that a player who has played a fairly important role this season in a variety of competitions could be kept around — after all, as Klopp says, there is no chance of winning consistently without these types of squad players, albeit at £35m, he was brought in to be more than that.How much would Oxlade-Chamberlain be worth now should he be made available on the transfer market? Probably far less than it would cost to replace him, but clearly losing him for nothing a year later would not be preferable either. Even if he has been 'left behind' a little at Anfield, there is still a big conundrum for Julian Ward and Jürgen Klopp to solve before the summer. But keeping Oxlade-Chamberlain into next season would be no bad thing.",https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/twqpifgQ/poster.jpg
"4500 public rental households went on to home ownership in last five years: HDB - CNA
Residents seen along the corridor of a public rental HDB flat in Singapore. (File Photo: CNA/Calvin Oh)SINGAPORE: About 4,500 households living in public rental flats bought their own homes over the past five years, with the help of various Housing Board (HDB) schemes and grants.
This figure - from 2017 to 2021 - represents close to 9 per cent of the total rental households in Singapore, HDB said on Sunday (Mar 6).
Of these, three in four bought a flat from HDB while the rest got it from the resale market. 
About two-thirds bought a flat with the help of housing grants such as the Additional CPF Housing Grant and Special CPF Housing Grant, which are up to S$40,000 each, as well as the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant of up to S$80,000.
Most of the households bought either a 3-room or 4-room flat.
HDB also gave an update on the work of its Home Ownership Support Team (HST), which provides support for rental tenants to buy their own homes.
Its role includes helping those who are ready to buy a flat navigate the processes involved - from application to key collection, and helping families assess their ability to afford one.
When it was set up in 2019, it set a target of reaching out to 1,000 households, who were ""preliminarily assessed to be ready to buy a flat"", by 2023.
""As of Dec 31, 2021, the HST has engaged about 1,030 rental households, surpassing the target of 1,000 rental households and achieving it two years earlier than planned,"" said HDB.  
""Of these more than 1,000 rental households, 340 should be ready for home ownership within the next three years"", added HDB. 
The remaining households are in the process of assessment or are not ready to apply for a flat in the near term.
HST will continue to track their progress and help them to move on to home ownership, where feasible, HDB said.We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

Indonesia-born, Singapore-based businessman Turochas Fuad and his year-old company Pace, a “buy now pay later” (BNPL) fintech firm, is rapidly expanding across Asia, giving consumers and merchants more flexible payment options.Indonesia-born, Singapore-based businessman Turochas Fuad. (Photo: Aik Chen)If you’ve noticed a proliferation of “buy now pay later” (BNPL) options at retail stores, you are not alone. This mode of payment is growing in popularity and its tremendous revenue potential is being tapped by several players.Case in point: Pace, a BNPL fintech company, recently secured US$40 million (S$54 million) in Series A investment funding from established investors such as UOB Venture Management (Singapore), Appworks (Taiwan) and Marubeni Venture (Japan).Launched barely a year ago, Pace now has over 3,000 points of sale across Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Thailand and it is now targeted to hit one million users before the end of 2022. It is swiftly expanding into Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, and looks set to achieve US$1 billion in Gross Merchandise Value for 2022.The man spearheading the company, Turochas Fuad, is a successful serial entrepreneur who has sold three start-ups, including co-working space Spacemob to WeWork and home vacation rental site Travelmob to Nasdaq-listed HomeAway (now called Vrbo). In between dreaming up the next big idea, Fuad held senior management roles, such as managing director of WeWork Southeast Asia and Korea, as well as that of Skype Asia Pacific.Fuad, better known as “T” in the industry, is clear about his ambitions for Pace, which is represented by the logo of a horse denoting strength, stability and advancement. He said: “People know us today as a BNPL company but we're definitely more than that. We're actually a fintech company that wants to democratise finance in a way where we empower traditional financial institutions all the way to neobanks.”For the uninitiated, a BNPL payment is similar to instalment purchase plans (IPP), where banks and credit cards break up the payment for a large-ticket item into smaller monthly repayments, with or without interest. The difference? The repayment period for a BNPL tends to be shorter (within three to four months versus six to 12 months for an IPP); consumers do not need to have a credit card nor are restricted to a particular bank or card, and it can be used on lower priced items such as cosmetics, apparel and other lifestyle goods.In Asian markets such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, where credit card penetration rates are low, BNPL payments represent a huge potential. According to American fintech solution provider FIS’s 2021 Global Payments Report, they accounted for only 2.1 per cent of global e-commerce transactions in 2020. That figure is expected to double by 2024. Closer home, a 2021 study showed that 38 per cent of Singaporeans, an estimated 1.1 million, have used a BNPL service, with those from 25 to 44 years being the most likely ones to have done so (43 to 44 per cent).Which is why Fuad is unfazed by the existing competition, despite Pace being a relative latecomer. “There’s always this perception that it is a crowded market, that there are a lot of different players out there. The reality is that BNPL is still a very nascent product. If you ask anyone walking around, maybe not all of them are aware of what BNPL is, it’s a market where education is still being done,” said the Indonesian-born and Singapore-based businessman, who is banking on the company’s ability to “optimise and fully ultra-localise” the customer experience in the respective Asian markets to gain a competitive edge.He explained: “We are familiar with the businesses that are favoured in the different local markets. In Japan, for example, we will support different types of local payments that are familiar to the Japanese, such as cash transactions through the convenience stores located at every corner.”In Singapore, Pace started off with merchants such as Sincere Watch and Goldheart, based on the assumption that consumers would only opt for instalment payments on higher priced items like luxury watches and jewellery.The millennials and Gen Zs now make up 72 per cent of their shoppers, which explains the company’s recent 80s-vibes brand campaigns. “One of the biggest drivers for this age group and segment is alternative payments. They’re all using different types of digital wallets. Whenever they open a bank account, they’re issued debit cards, which have never been offered IPP before,” Fuad shared.Pace’s merchant partners now include mass-market and mid-tier lifestyle brands such as Bath & Body Works, motherswork and Owndays, where the average transaction value is between S$50 and S$100. Pace users are allowed to split their purchases into three interest-free payments over 60 days and there is a spending limit depending on whether you use a credit or debit card for payment. Miss a payment deadline and you will be charged a late fee of S$10 with additional charges incurred for every additional overdue day. You can pay in full anytime and your ability to purchase is halted if you reach the spending limit or default on a payment.A survey conducted by Pace of over 260 Gen Zs found that more than 55 per cent of them are “a huge fan of BNPL” and many of them do not use credit cards. Fuad share: “They believe that BNPL allows them to manage their cash flow better. It doesn't really put them in debt because it's typically smaller amounts of transactions.”He added: “Every consumer that signs up with us, behind the scenes, we evaluate them in terms of what they can or cannot spend, based on the information that we can gather. We then assign different sets of buying limits on our consumers. This ensures that shoppers practise sustainable spending, while also enabling split payments in a safe manner no matter which payment method is being used.”Despite witnessing the power of technology in all his ventures, Fuad believes that a company’s success still boils down to its people. He said: “There’re members in the Pace team that have worked with me for six to seven, 12 to 15 years. I think it’s something unique that we’re still sticking around, building and scaling businesses together.”He is excited about the good that Pace can do for society in terms of financial inclusion, despite public misgivings about BNPL.He said: “BNPL is a great starting point for us to build credit scoring capabilities with the consumers and the businesses that we have. We can then democratise finance for those who might not have access to financing tools, such as debit card holders, independent professionals and gig workers, by offering Web3-based financing products like alternative currencies and new forms of wallets.”Meantime, he is keeping calm with the rapid expansion through baking – “sourdough, brioche, French bread” – and spending quality time with his wife and two young daughters. But of course, the mind of an entrepreneur is never far from the business.Fuad quipped: “Baking is like growing a company. The yeast is the secret ingredient that makes the dough rise, and you need to be patient. In any business, there’re certain ingredients that will make it successful and you just have to keep at it.”We know it's a hassle to switch browsers but we want your experience with CNA to be fast, secure and the best it can possibly be.To continue, upgrade to a supported browser or, for the finest experience, download the mobile app.Upgraded but still having issues?

Omicron could turn out to be a boon for the travel industry, as more are willing to travel with peace of mind that they won’t get reinfected, says travel writer Raini Hamdi.Empty check-in counters are seen at the international terminal of Arlanda Airport in Sweden. (AFP/Jonathan NACKSTRAND)SINGAPORE: Travel now feels almost like it was before COVID-19 upended our lives. When I travelled to Switzerland via Bangkok just last week, there were no tests nor contact tracing apps to download - I only had to prove my vaccination status. The travel industry was picking up after most countries got over their Delta surge. But Omicron dashed the hopes of a slowly recovering travel industry when it emerged in the end-2021, prompting a slew of new travel restrictions ahead of the Christmas travel peak.The number of COVID-19 cases has hit record highs in many countries since then, but the high community cases may have stirred acceptance that international travellers don’t pose any more risk than what’s already in the community. Sensing this, some governments have lowered the drawbridge, ready to embrace endemic living with COVID-19. Travel quotas may have been relaxed.  on Friday (Mar 4).Virtually every seat in the Singapore Airlines’ lounge at Changi Airport Terminal 3 was taken when I awaited my flight to Zurich. High vaccination rates may have something to do with it. But pre-Omicron, there was still some travel hesitancy in the air as quarantine-free vaccinated travel lanes opened up. While travel quarantines were indeed a major bugbear for many, what was more worrying was the possibility of getting infected overseas. What hoops might we have to jump through if we test positive overseas? How do we get medical care if we don’t speak the local language? And what about all that hassle of arranging additional accommodation or having to stomach your company’s wag of the finger if you had to stay an extra two weeks away after an already long holiday?All those issues melt away for someone who catches Omicron. The peace of mind it offers when you travel is an upside. With more people having recovered from an Omicron infection, some may feel more confident of the immunity it confers and look to satisfy the pent-up wanderlust.So could Omicron, once the bane of the travel industry, turn out to be the boon that heralds its revival?Pent-up travel demand has erupted, like champagne spurting out of a bottle.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported the fastest increase in international tickets sold in January and February since the start of the pandemic. In early February, travel ticket sales were reaching half of that in pre-pandemic February 2019.This reflects the relaxation of travel rules announced around the world, including in Australia, France, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Sweden, said IATA.Singaporeans, starved for a change in scenery for the last two years, too can’t wait to travel. Skyscanner saw a 71 per cent increase in searches in January up from the previous month. Top destinations searched in Singapore included Manila, Seoul, London, Kuala Lumpur and Melbourne.Forward bookings by Singapore travellers to Australia shot up 179 per cent after the latter re-opened its borders, according to travel analytics firm ForwardKeys. “We are encouraged by the indications of return to travel thus far,” said Brent Anderson, Tourism Australia's regional general manager based in Singapore.Likewise, Booking.com saw an uptick in bookings by Singapore travellers in the past month to short-haul destinations like Kuala Lumpur and Seoul, and those farther away like London and Paris, said its Asia-Pacific managing director, Laura Houldsworth.Travel industry leaders believe that travel will rebound and recover in the long term. East to West, West to East, the world has wings again. But is it time to pop the champagne to mark the return of travel as it was?For one, the war in Ukraine has thrown a spanner in the works. Oil prices have surged above US$100 (S$135) a barrel for the first time in seven years. Airfares may rise in tandem with higher fuel costs, against a backdrop of soaring inflation and higher costs of living, leaving leisure travellers thinking twice when doing the sums.And really, talk about recovery falls flat because China, the world's largest outbound travel market,  if they serve a 14 or 21-day quarantine on their return – eye-wateringly long when many countries have reduced or removed this measure completely.Chinese travellers made 169 million trips in 2019, spending an astounding US$255 billion while overseas, according to China’s National Bureau of Statistics and the United Nations World Tourism Organisation.The world remains far from pre-pandemic levels of connectivity. But as more travellers pack their bags, are destinations ready for them?IATA's analysis of the world's top 50 air travel markets, which includes Singapore, shows 37 of them are open to vaccinated travellers with varying conditions. But only 18 markets have removed quarantine or pre-departure tests while the others require testing or quarantine or both.Vaccinated travellers certainly face fewer hassles now than a few weeks ago, and this gives travellers the confidence to buy tickets. But IATA director-general Willie Walsh thinks the removal of travel restrictions can be further accelerated, such as removing quarantine and testing for the fully vaccinated or requiring only a negative pre-departure antigen test result for the unvaccinated.The COVID-19 pandemic is unlike any other crisis the industry has endured. Job losses and border measures have created a massive labour shortage, and service levels will be affected if they aren’t able to fill those roles as quickly as travellers arrive.Domestic precautionary measures have hollowed out once lively and colourful local streets, and empty storefronts and dwindling nightlife haunts bode poorly for tourism.Being locked within our shores for two years hasn’t just kept us from travelling and seeing the sights. It took away precious opportunities to discover new cultures, meet with friends and associates and be with our loved ones.Omicron may have persuaded governments to re-open borders and given travellers the confidence to dust off their passports. But that’s only half the picture.  The other half is a mostly vaccinated world recovering from COVID-19, who may finally cast their minds off concerns they may catch it while travelling.The travel industry needs to worry less about getting arrival numbers back to pre-pandemic levels and more about how to spoil guests and welcome them back in a heartfelt way.That is not to downplay how serious COVID-19 can be. But where experts have said vaccination can render it less potent, for the majority of people in the pink of health, it looks like catching COVID-19 can come with a travel benefit.Australia greeted its first international arrivals in two years in Sydney on Feb 21 with the words “Welcome Back World!” painted near the runways. Airline and airport staff cheered while kangaroo mascots hugged the travellers. Nearby, a banner read: “You were worth the wait.”Word will get out that travel is fun and magical again. Raini Hamdi is a Singapore-based business journalist who writes on hospitality, travel and tourism in Asia.

Singapore Airlines yesterday announced it will begin operating A380 flights to India from March 14th. For now, Mumbai will be the only Indian city to get the Giant of the Skies, but Delhi is expected to follow soon.Singapore Airlines currently operates a daily Airbus A350 service to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM), along with a bi-weekly service using the same aircraft type. As per the new schedule, daily flights will be replaced by the Airbus A380, while the A350-900s will keep operating the twice-a-week schedule.Sy Yen Chen, General Manager of Singapore Airlines for India, stated,“We are thrilled to be able to bring our iconic superjumbo back to India. We are optimistic that this will inspire even more confidence for international travel to and from India.”The tourism industry is a significant contributor to Singapore’s economy. According to data from Statista, the industry was directly responsible for approximately 4% of the South Asian country’s GDP in 2019. But the pandemic had single-handedly brought nearly all of international travel to a stop.Stay informed:  for our daily and weekly aviation news digests.The Singapore government has long had bilateral travel bubble arrangements with many countries to make travel for vaccinated passengers easier and stimulate recovery. SIA has now decided to gradually bring all its flights to India under the Vaccinated Travel Lane. This includes flights to Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kochi, and Kolkata, among others.Chen also said,“Singapore’s decision to expand its VTL arrangement to cover all points across India will be a welcome development for all our customers. We continue to see strong demand across India from customers who are waiting to enjoy convenient and quarantine-free travel to Singapore.”This means that vaccinated passengers traveling between the two countries will now be exempt from mandatory quarantine rules on arrival. However, individuals looking to enter Singapore will have to apply for a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) before the visa application. G B Srithar, Singapore Tourism Board’s Regional Director for IMESA (India, Middle East, and South Asia), said in a statement,“The extension of VTL to Singapore from all Indian cities provides the much needed impetus to travel between the countries for all traveller types, whether for leisure, business or cruise. This is part of Singapore’s calibrated and progressive approach in re-opening our borders.”This isn’t the first time the Singaporean flag carrier has made plans to bring A380 flights back to India. As Simple Flying reported in December last year, SIA initially planned the A380’s return to the largest democracy in January this year. Mumbai (BOM) was to get superjumbo flights from January 10th and New Delhi (DEL) from February 14th. However, the airline delayed the schedule by two months for BOM, while DEL flights won’t return until May.As we move towards a steady aviation recovery from the horrors of the pandemic, Singapore Airlines, Qatar, Emirates, and British Airways have all deployed most of their A380 fleet back into service. It will be interesting to see if there is enough demand over the summer travel season for airlines to fill these superjumbo jets.Have you traveled on any of Singapore Airlines’ A380s before?

"'I'm exhausted. My mind is a blank': A day in the life of a GP during the Omicron surge - The Straits Times
SINGAPORE - The has resulted in long queues at general practitioner (GP) clinics.The Straits Times spent 14 hours at a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) - which provides subsidised treatment and medication for those with respiratory symptoms - to see what the situation is like for staff there.It is 8am on Wednesday (March 2) and the shutters are still down at Sims Drive Medical Clinic, which is not due to open for another half hour.But a construction supervisor who wanted to be known only as Mr Wong, 61, is already sitting on the kerb outside, waiting to see the doctor for his high blood pressure.Located in the middle of an HDB estate, the clinic, which has been serving the neighbourhood for the last 22 years, is sandwiched between a hairdressing salon and a cafe.""There's always a long queue here, many patients, so I decided to come earlier,"" Mr Wong, a Malaysian, says in Mandarin.The line extends past the clinic, and across the shopfront of the eatery next door, but the scene is calm, with most patients quietly using their phones.Behind the shutters, however, there is a flurry of activity as a team of three clinic assistants prepare the clinic for the day ahead.At 8.30am, the shutters go up with a loud clanking, and patients slowly but steadily stream in.By 8.33am, the first suspected Covid-19 patient - Ms Astar Tan - registers, and is told to wait outside.The 31-year-old researcher had a sore throat and cough and tested positive with a self-administered antigen rapid test (ART) the night before.""On (the Health Ministry's website), I saw that if I'm feeling well and test positive, I can just rest at home. But because I have a cough and sore throat, I want to see the doctor for medication,"" says Ms Tan, adding that she wanted to get a medical certificate (MC), and that the clinic was closer to her home than a Quick Test Centre.The authorities have said on several occasions thatbut some people have said they still Over the rest of the morning, another 35 suspected Covid-19 patients will visit the clinic. Each suspected case is told to wait outside for the safety of other patients, and most sit at a nearby open-air common area, which doubles as a makeshift waiting room.But this means that when the time comes for them to see the doctor, the busy clinic assistants - voices already muffled by two layers of masks and a face shield - have to come out and shout out their names, straining to make themselves heard over the noise of traffic on the road and the HDB estate.At any time, there are five to 10 patients waiting outside, while another five wait in the clinic. Some other patients enter, take a number and then head off to run errands while waiting, and are nowhere to be found when their number is called.Some of the Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms tell ST they want to get an MC, or seek the doctor's advice as he is ""more reliable"".At noon, clinic assistant Sindy Chong flips the sign on the door to ""closed"", but there are still about eight patients waiting to see the doctor.The sign does not stop some people from trying to walk in for an appointment anyway. A few middle-aged men are turned away, but an elderly lady is allowed to register due to her old age, Ms Chong explains.The last patient is finally cleared by 12.50pm, 20 minutes after the clinic is scheduled to close. The staff then need to disinfect the clinic and prepare for the afternoon session, which begins at 2pm.""It's considered manageable - not as busy as Saturdays and Mondays,"" says Ms Chong, who has not had time to drink water or use the restroom all morning.For the staff, lunch is a takeaway meal eaten in about 10 to 15 minutes in the clinic, as they need to quickly begin preparing for the next shift.Dr Lim Chien Chuan requests that we take a break before his interview.""I'm exhausted. My mind is a blank,"" says the veteran doctor of nearly 30 years, who grabs a quick bite at a nearby eatery.He later explains: ""It's very intense. When I'm working, there's always pressure for time because there are patients who are waiting and getting impatient, but we also have to try to balance it with giving the best care that we can.""At 2pm, the shutters go up again, letting in three patients who are already waiting outside.Aside from dispensing medicine, registering and swabbing patients, and other duties, clinic staff also need to field a stream of calls from people who have Covid-19.Clinic assistant Caren Manahan estimates that the clinic gets about eight to 10 such calls an hour.""We get many of them calling us, saying they have Covid-19 and don't know what to do. So we have to explain and guide them,"" she says.This afternoon, the crowd is thinner than usual, possibly due to a heavy thunderstorm keeping people away, and the session ends only five minutes later than scheduled at 4.35pm, to the visible delight of the staff.""This is rare - we usually finish around 5 or 5.30,"" says Ms Manahan.But for Dr Lim, the day is far from over.By 6.45pm, a queue of eight people has already formed outside the clinic, and the process begins again.Tonight's patients include 33-year-old housewife Jeane Lee, whose three-year-old daughter tested positive and has a fever.""I'm worried she's unwell and uncomfortable and doesn't know how to tell me, and I can't tell because I'm not a doctor... I wanted to make sure she's okay,"" says Ms Lee, who has to wait over an hour to see the doctor.Not everyone is as patient. A woman who comes to ask Dr Lim to interpret her mother's blood test results decides to leave after a 45-minute wait, as she feels it is taking too long.At 9.40pm, the last patient for the day - a man with runny nose and cough - finally sees Dr Lim after a 1 hour and 15 minute wait.All in, Dr Lim has seen about 80 patients - up from the pre-surge number of about 50 to 60 - of whom about 50 have symptoms of acute respiratory infection.""I'm glad it's over, and I can go back and sleep, and prepare for tomorrow,"" he says, tiredness showing in his eyes.Dr Lim says he does not begrudge Covid-19 patients who visit his clinic despite having only mild symptoms, even though this adds to his workload.He explains that some tested negative but have symptoms and are trying to be socially responsible, while others are at a loss as to what to do next, or how to protect their babies or the elderly at home from their illness.""If I put myself in their position, I'd probably do the same too,"" he says.Despite the already heavy workload it is seeing, Sims Drive Medical Clinic earlier answered the Government's call for and For the past two weekends, it has operated additional hours from 2pm to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.Dr Lim says this was a ""very difficult decision"", but explains: ""We know that a single clinic opening extended hours will not create a dent (on high case numbers). But if the whole GP community, all of us, can step forward, I think it'll help.""Asked how he manages to push through his exhaustion, he simply says: ""When I'm seeing my patient and I'm tired, (I tell myself) every patient I see is one more person who will be happy and healthy.""If I can see just another patient, I'm making another person happy and healthy. And that keeps me going.""",https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/articles/2022/03/05/AK_doc1_050322.jpg?VersionId=4BdGsKwQJEVEdlAmyRfWAC0jgLFzOYQh,"5 things to know about vitamin supplements, Lifestyle News - AsiaOne
Here are five things to know about vitamin supplements! It really depends on the type of vitamin. Some, including vitamin C, can cause stomach irritation or gastric problems when taken on an empty stomach.Others, such as vitamins A, D, E and K, are fat-soluble and are best taken after a meal that has some form of fat.In some cases, yes.For instance, calcium does not work well with iron, which means you should never pop a calcium pill right after an iron-rich meal (think a spinach salad or a pig liver soup).Also, if you are on antibiotics, stay away from zinc supplements as the two are believed to cancel out each other's benefits.Any drink with caffeine in it - that would include coffee, tea and certain soft drinks like colas - can prevent your body from absorbing the vitamins that you consume.Some scientists believe that healthy levels of vitamin B-12 or vitamin D can encourage better sleep at night.Frequent travellers swear by vitamin C. Pop one before a flight as it can help to strengthen your immune system, and in turn, reduce the chances of post-flight fatigue and restlessness.READ ALSO: This article was first published in Wonderwall.sg.",https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_image/public/original_images/Mar2022/010322_vitaminsupplements_pexels.jpg?itok=gnjQ8qLh,"What to eat and what not to eat when you are down with Covid-19 - AsiaOne
SINGAPORE - Your head is pounding, your throat is sore. You have a persistent cough and feel very fatigued. You might not be able to smell and taste your food.Yes, you are one of tens of thousands of people in Singapore who have come down with Covid-19.The temptation is to order in, to snack while holed up in your room, or maybe to have a stiff drink or two.If you want to feel better and recover, hold your horses.Dietitians say there are better food choices.Three, from National University Polyclinics (NUP), Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH) and Changi General Hospital (CGH), advocate sticking to a balanced diet.[[nid:568035]]Dietitian Bernice Tan from NUP says: ""We would still recommend that patients have a healthy balanced diet and encourage them to have meals which consist of whole grains, lean protein, vegetables and fruit, to boost energy and facilitate speedy recovery.""However, they may not have much appetite due to the lack of energy and existing symptoms that can affect their usual food intake. The texture of food can be modified to help them eat better, especially if they still feel unwell.""She says food can be cooked longer to make it softer and easier on the throat. Some examples include rice porridge, soupy noodles, fish, stewed meat, tofu, eggs and soft fruit such as papaya, banana and watermelon.Some deep-fried and high-fat food, she adds, pass through the gastrointestinal tract too quickly and can cause diarrhoea. Or they may stay in the stomach longer and cause bloating.The combination of acids in spicy food can cause a burning sensation in the throat and stomach too.It is also advisable to avoid ultra-processed food such as chocolates, sweets, ice cream and chips as they are low in nutrients.""Remember, the body needs nutrients to recover,"" she adds.Dietitian Tan Ying Xin from CGH says it is not uncommon for people recovering from the virus to have a reduced sense of taste and smell.[[nid:568929]]She says: ""This can affect their appetite as food may be perceived to be more bland than usual. Combined with the discomfort of a sore throat and/or a cough, a patient may end up passing over his or her healthy eating habits. ""For example, some may increase the amount of sauces or salt in food to compensate for the lack of taste. Excessive sodium intake, unfortunately, may increase blood pressure and the risk of hypertension, she warns.When people with Covid-19 are staying home to recover, she notes there may be a higher tendency to use food delivery services or consume more overly processed food, such as instant noodles, canned cream soup or long-life pastries.""Doing so will increase the intake of salt and saturated fats,"" she says.Ms Chow Pek Yee, head of KTPH's Department of Nutrition & Dietetics, adds that hydration is important to replace lost fluids, prevent dry throat and avoid triggering a cough.She suggests adding lemon, berries or mint leaves to flavour water, if water on its own is deemed too plain or boring.CGH's Ms Tan notes there has been a lot of hype about consuming coconut water post-vaccination and while recovering from Covid-19.[[nid:567809]]""There is, however, no evidence that coconut water will cure one of Covid-19,"" she says.""Beverages such as coconut water and isotonic drinks contain electrolytes such as potassium and sodium, and may benefit someone who is experiencing a deficit from excessive fluid loss from diarrhoea.""But bear in mind that they still contain carbohydrates, sometimes in the form of added sugar. Avoid consuming excessive amounts. Plain water is still the best form of hydration,"" she advises.The dietitians also offer practical advice for people who want to manage their diets well, while recovering from the virus.Ms Tan from NUP says people who are struggling to eat their usual food portions can have healthy snacks two to three hours after their main meals, to make sure they are getting enough nutrients.She suggests a slice of wholemeal bread with soft margarine, jam with no added sugar or low-fat cheese; a cup of warm low-fat milk or reduced-sugar, high-calcium soya milk; or a small tub of low-fat yogurt.CGH's Ms Tan also suggests buying thinly sliced meat, which defrosts and cooks quickly. Citrus fruit are high in vitamin C, and can be eaten on their own or used to flavour water and salad dressing, she says.Also consider boosting the protein content in food by cooking with milk, which can be used in place of water when cooking oats, or used to soak oats overnight in the fridge for breakfast the next day.She adds: ""Now that people are spending longer periods at home, it is good to take this as an opportunity to prepare more wholesome meals or explore recipes they previously did not have the time to make.""Plan ahead and take advantage of food delivery platforms to deliver fresh ingredients such as vegetables, meat and poultry too.""In the long run, however, it will take more than eating healthily to boost the immune system to be Covid-19-free.Ms Chow from KTPH says: ""To ensure our immune system is healthy all year round, we need to ensure we eat well and have a balanced diet and adequate sleep, and manage stress.""She and the other dietitians advocate the Health Promotion Board's My Healthy Plate concept. The idea here is to have half a plate of vegetables, a quarter of a plate of protein-rich foods and a quarter of a plate of whole grains.She adds: ""Eat at least two servings of fruit daily and keep well hydrated. At Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, our five pillars of health are: eat wisely, exercise regularly, be happy, stop smoking and practise good hygiene.""Ms Tan Ying Xin, a dietitian at Changi General Hospital, suggests these foods to help Covid-19 patients recover:1. Lean animal protein such as meat, poultry and seafood.2. Eggs, which are a source of vitamin A and protein, and versatile.3. Citrus fruit, which are high in vitamin C.4. Unsweetened milk fortified with vitamin D.5. Nuts and seeds, which are sources of vitamin E.Ms Bernice Tan, dietitian at National University Polyclinics, suggests avoiding the following:1. Deep -fried and high- fat food such as fatty cuts of meat and butter2. Processed meat3. Ultra -processed foods4. Spicy food such as mala dishes or dishes with chilli5. Alcohol, as it irritates the stomach lining, caus ing indigestion and making patients feel more nauseated.This article was first published in The Straits Times. ",https://media.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_image/public/original_images/Mar2022/050321_sick_pexels.jpg?itok=wssEOtJZ,"'A question of time': experts fear Balkans measles outbreak - ฺBangkok Post
published :
													6 Mar 2022 at 05:45												writer: 
															AFP PODGORICA (MONTENEGRO) - Despite vaccinating her first child, Vanja drew a line when it came time to inoculate her second and decided he would not be receiving the measles shot.The 44-year-old psychologist living in Montenegro's capital Podgorica gave a host of reasons why she changed her mind, all after binging on a deluge of information shared in an online group she belongs to. ""I don't trust the vaccination system. We lack information and education,"" Vanja told AFP, asking that her surname be withheld.""I feel great responsibility and it wasn't a simple and easy decision to make."" Vanja's position is increasingly common in Montenegro which has the lowest measles vaccine uptake globally with just 23.8 percent of infants inoculated in 2020 with the first of two shots, according to World Health Organization data. The dramatic decline in inoculation rates has public health experts bracing for an imminent measles outbreak in Montenegro and its nearby Balkan neighbours where vaccination uptake has also plummeted, largely due to a rise in misinformation, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The risk of a measles outbreak is high,"" Dragan Jankovic, an immunisation official with the WHO, told AFP.""Importation of the measles virus is only a question of time... as soon as it is imported into a susceptible population, an outbreak will start.""In neighbouring North Macedonia, 63 percent of children were inoculated with the first shot of the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, while in Serbia 78 percent have had the jab. - 'Perfect storm' -Experts say a uptake of at least 95 percent of the two-dose jab is needed to avoid the spread of measles, a highly contagious airborne disease that can be fatal.The virus can cause complications that include blindness, brain swelling and pneumonia, and unvaccinated children are at the highest risk of developing serious cases -- including death.But for decades, there has been an aversion to the MMR shot, rooted in rampant misinformation tied to a widely debunked 1998 study that suggested a link between autism and the vaccine.The United Nations has repeatedly warned that a ""perfect storm"" was brewing for new outbreaks of preventable diseases, with the pandemic disrupting routine vaccinations.And even after the measles killed over 207,000 people worldwide in 2019, vaccination rates still dropped in many parts of the globe.The first-dose vaccination rate dropped from 86 to 84 percent globally between 2019 and 2020, while only 70 percent received a second dose during the same period, according to WHO data.In the Balkans, epidemiologists chalk up the growing anti-vax sentiment to several factors, including distrust in the government, a lack of serious enforcement measures, and a deluge of misinformation that overwhelmed social media during the pandemic.In Montenegro, doctors have called on the government to take the issue more seriously, saying small fines on parents who refuse mandatory vaccine mandates have done little to reverse the country's anti-vax shift.""The MMR vaccine is currently not a condition for enrolment in schools and kindergartens,"" Milena Popovic Samardzic, an epidemiologist from Montenegro's Institute of Public Health, told AFP.Almost one-third of Montenegrins believe a conspiracy theory that alleges doctors and government seek to vaccinate children with shots that cause autism, according to an Ipsos survey published in 2021.The same report also found that over half of the country's population are convinced that ""global elites"" created the coronavirus in order to slash the planet's population.  - 'Fed up' -In Serbia, the vaccine is mandatory for student enrolment but experts say officials often turn a blind eye to the problem until an outbreak forces their hand. ""The state only needs to follow the rules they set out,"" said Georgios Konstantinidis, the head of Serbia's paediatrics association.""But nobody does -- neither the parents nor the people in kindergartens who enrol kids through 'connections'.""Serbia was last hit by a measles outbreak in 2017, resulting in 3,800 recorded cases and 12 deaths, including two children.In wake of the outbreak, state prosecutors launched proceedings against 43 prominent anti-vaxers for ""causing panic"", but none were convicted, according to Vladimir Cimerman, a Belgrade doctor who helped bring a lawsuit.Doctors in Serbia are increasingly frustrated that warnings go ignored.  ""We lack social responsibility. I'm fed up with everything,"" said Konstantinidis.""Basic humanity has vanished from this society, and the whole world for that matter.""TAK: A cattle trader was caught with 70 fake 1,000-baht banknotes in his possession at a checkpoint in Umphang district of this lower northern province on Sunday, police said.MELBOURNE: Shane Warne offered gifts of his old cricket clothing and ate the traditional Australian snack of Vegemite on toast in the final hours before his death on Friday, an associate of the cricketing great said.Oil prices soar more than 6%, touching their highest since 2008 on Monday, as the United States and its European allies contemplate a ban on imports of Russian oil.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20220306/c1_4246663.jpg

tvN’s new Monday-Tuesday drama “Military Prosecutor Doberman” has captivated viewers with just its first week!The drama premiered on February 28 with strong ratings of 5.263 percent, the highest rated drama in its time slot of the night. The second episode, which aired on March 1, set a new personal best for the drama at 7.009 percent.Here are three reasons why viewers are already hooked on the fast-paced legal action drama:In just two episodes, “Military Prosecutor Doberman” established its own unique color and the birth of a genre that is different from the ones viewers had seen before. Although there have been countless legal dramas, this is the first drama to focus on cases that occur in the military court and the specific job of military prosecutors who handle those cases. Despite the unfamiliar setting, the drama is firmly grounded in realism and tells a compelling story that anyone can enjoy no matter their background.Screenwriter Yoon Hyun Ho said, “I was excited to work on a project that was the first in Korea to be based on the military court, but when I started writing, I felt a lot of pressure. I approached the script like I was writing a historical drama, checking each scene for errors and accuracy.”The drama also tackles head-on military issues that have recently been hot topics in the news, such as preferential treatment for certain soldiers. However, the drama portrays the world of the military in a humorous way, allowing viewers to approach the story in a way that’s easy for them to understand. As “Military Prosecutor Doberman” dives further into the world of military court cases, viewers can expect to see more of the interesting twists and turns of the new “military law drama” genre.It goes without saying that the two major players behind the early success of “Military Prosecutor Doberman” are its two lead actors: Ahn Bo Hyun and Jo Bo Ah. Ahn Bo Hyun perfectly pulls off the role of Do Bae Man, who only cares about money, and Jo Bo Ah tackles a new kind of role for her as Cha Woo In, who chooses the path of a military prosecutor to get revenge. Other stand-out cast members include Oh Yeon Soo, who plays the tough villain Noh Hwa Young, Kim Young Min, who plays the ambitious lawyer Yong Moon Gu, and Kim Woo Seok, who plays the crazy, young, and rich company president Noh Tae Nam.Ahn Bo Hyun shows his acting chops in portraying the moral ambiguity of Do Bae Man, who cannot be clearly labeled as evil or good. Jo Bo Ah shows her character’s ability to lie and disguise herself as she dons a red wig and adopts an alter ego. Another key point in the drama is the chemistry between these polar opposites—not just emotional chemistry but also their physical chemistry. At the end of episode 2, the two military prosecutors show off their fighting skills as they battle a gang that has been sent after Do Bae Man. Do Bae Man begins to suspect Cha Woo In is more than what she seems, while Cha Woo in sees the advantages in controlling him for her own ends.As soon as “Military Prosecutor Doberman” aired, people nicknamed it the “time-flash” drama, for how fast the time goes by when you’re watching. The dynamic story keeps viewers hooked from start to finish by never slowing down its pace. In just two episodes, Do Bae Man and Cha Woo In’s histories are clearly revealed, and cases like preferential treatment and illegal filming are handled quickly without frustrating viewers by dragging out scenes.The drama also draws viewers in to the unfamiliar genre of “military law” by satisfying their senses. It uses energetic, fast-paced action scenes to get rid of bad guys, particularly to create forceful endings. In episode 1, Cha Woo In puts on a red wig and uses her bare hands to take down an idol named Allen (Park Sang Nam) and his friends, who are guilty of illegal filming and distributing the footage. In episode 2, Do Bae Man and Cha Woo In showed their physical chemistry and partnership by fighting back against the gang together. Cha Woo In uses the car wipers in a creative way during the fight, while the background music adds an exciting rhythm that raises viewers’ heartbeats during the scene.There are also comedic notes sprinkled throughout the drama. Although the subject matter could easily become too dark, the script lightens the overall tone with wit and comedy, keeping viewers interested in what happens next.What did you think of the first two episodes?Watch “Military Prosecutor Doberman” below!

"View A Mars-Venus Meet-Up As The Moon Passes The Pleiades: What To See In Your Night Sky This Week - Forbes
Each Monday I pick out the northern hemisphere’s celestial highlights (mid-northern latitudes) for the week ahead, but be sure to check my main feed for more in-depth articles on stargazing, astronomy, eclipses and more.This week sees a gaggle of planets gather in the pre-dawn hours, culminating in a reasonably close conjunction between Mars and Venus on Saturday. After dark the Moon is getting brighter, but not before the lovely sight of a crescent Moon passing very close to the Pleiades open star cluster—itself one of the most beautiful objects to gaze at in the night sky. Get up before sunrise today and look to the southeast and you’ll see a very bright planet—that’s Venus. However, there will be three others shining close by; Mars just to the lower-right of Venus and, closer to the horizon (if you have a clear view that low) to the lower-left, first Saturn, then Mars. The three planets will appear to be far dimmer than Venus and as the sky brightens you will need binoculars. As the week continues, Mercury will sink and Saturn will rise to be closer to Venus and Mars. Look to the south after dark tonight and you’ll see a 36%-lit crescent Moon shining close to the best-looking open star cluster to Earth, the Pleiades, in the constellation of Taurus. Get those binoculars out for a great close-up of both (though naked-eye is fine). Today sees our satellite reach the First Quarter phase of its 29-day orbit of our planet. At this point it rises at noon and sets at midnight, so it begins to bleach the night sky and make stargazing tricky. That’s worsened by the fact that it’s also now 50% illuminated. If you’re up very early today then look the the southeast before sunrise to see Venus and Mars—the closest two planets to our own—appear close to each other in our sky.They will be about 4º apart, though Venus will shine much brighter (about 200 times brighter, in fact) in its current apparition as the “Morning Star.”Did you see the Pleiades close to the Moon on Tuesday in the southern night sky? The Pleiades (pronounced “plee-er-deez” or “player-deez”, but also known as the “Seven Sisters” and M45) is the brightest open star cluster in the sky.Around 444 light-years from the Solar System and around 100 million years old, the Pleiades are therefore little more than newborn stars ... if you think on a cosmic scale.The closest region of our Milky Way galaxy to us where stars are now being born, the Orion Nebula is the brightest nebula and is easily visible to the naked eye to the naked eye after dark each week in the southern sky. Part of “Orion’s Sword” that hangs down from Orion’s Belt, the Orion Nebula is a diffuse cloud of gas and dust about 1,300 light-years distant.Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes.",https://shouts.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/science-stem-feature.png,"A Dead Rocket Just Crashed Into the Moon, and Scientists Are Thrilled - CNET
A natural impact on the moon created this crater in 2013. It's about to get another. The impact took place on the far side of the moon out of view of any telescopes or spacecraft, but NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will be in a position to start taking photos of the impact site in mid-March.   Modeling software company AGI developed this animation of how the crash may have appeared from a point above the moon. Bill Gray, an amateur astronomer and software developer in Maine, first noticed the terminal trajectory. His software picked up the impact in an orbital model and Gray worked with observatories around the world to gather additional data and increase his confidence in the prediction. Gray believes he misidentified the booster as a Falcon 9 years ago. He and other researchers since confirmed it to be the Chinese rocket part instead. ""I am astounded that we can tell the difference between the two rocket body options -- SpaceX versus Chinese -- and confirm which one will impact the moon with the data we have,""  in a statement in February. ""The differences we see are primarily due to type of paint used by SpaceX and the Chinese.""So the rocket about to hit the Moon, it turns out, is not the one we thought it was. This (an honest mistake) just emphasizes the problem with lack of proper  tracking of these deep space objects. https://t.co/JXKpUmEC2XThe rocket crashed into the lunar surface in a crater named Hertzsprung that's a little larger than the state of Iowa. The location is remote enough that the impact doesn't pose any threat to the Apollo mission or other space program landing sites. ""(The) rocket impact will provide a fortuitous experiment that could reveal a lot about how natural collisions pummel and scour planetary surfaces,"" University of Colorado Boulder planetary scientist Paul Hayne wrote for The Conversation. ""A deeper understanding of impact physics will go a long way in helping researchers interpret the barren landscape of the Moon and also the effects impacts have on Earth and other planets.""Hayne expects the impact obliterated the rocket instantly, creating a white flash that could be visible if any spacecraft were in place with a vantage point. ""It will be the moon's newest archaeological site,"" . ""We'll learn something about the geology of the location from the color differences and distribution of the ejected material. It's an opportunity to learn more about the moon's mysterious far side.""Besides adding a new feature to the dark side of the moon, there's some concern it could also introduce tiny hitchhikers to our natural satellite. ""So I'm not bothered by one more crater being made on the moon,""  in The Conversation. ""It already has something like half a billion craters that are 10 meters or more in diameter. What we should worry about is contaminating the moon with living microbes, or molecules that could in the future be mistaken as evidence of former life on the moon.""The  last month raising its concern that not enough is being done to track space junk, as NASA and others hope to establish a permanent presence on the moon.""The upcoming lunar impact illustrates well the need for a comprehensive regulatory regime in space, not only for the economically crucial orbits around Earth but also applying to the moon,"" said Holger Krag, head of ESA's space safety program.This isn't the first time a spacecraft has slammed into the moon, although Gray thinks it might be the first time it's happening unintentionally. As recently as 2009,  in a search for water (it found some). ""In essence,"" Gray says, ""this is a 'free' Lcross.""  ",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/PbpCmgvOHgQuj-qmRDx7SdRHtus=/84x84/2011/10/17/73f135f8-8d74-11e3-a24e-d4ae52e62bcc/headshots_Erick_Mack_140x100.jpg,"There's a Rock Stuck in NASA's Mars Rover's Wheel - Futurism
NASA’s Mars Rover, also called Perseverance, seems to have taken a stowaway on board to cart across the Red Planet’s surface.On Friday, tech outlet CNET published a series of photos that show a medium-sized rock trapped in the rover’s wheel. The outlet reported that space fans who enjoy reviewing the raw images the Rover messages back to Earth noticed the rock and voted several pictures of it as “Image of the Week.”The first occurrence of the rock seems to have been February 6 and is available on NASA’s Mars Rover photo gallery. The next shot NASA lovers noticed was taken on February 25. The rock seems to have eroded some in this photo and appears to be slightly smaller than in the first shot. The third and most recent . There appears to be a growing chip in the rock and small particles of Martian dust or the broken rock lie inside the rover wheel. The image below also comes from the official NASA website.Despite the hitchhiker, the Mars Rover seems to be carrying on with business as usual. The rover is even breaking driving records, according to CNET. That may be partly due to Perseverance’s updated design, which CNET reports includes six wheels made from aluminum. It features cleats that give it traction on the rough, rocky and dusty terrain, and each wheel is just more than 20 inches in diameter.It’s good to hear Perseverance is, well, persevering, But we do feel a little bad about the trapped rock. Wouldn’t you find it annoying if nobody was around to help you get a rock out of your shoe?

NASA’s Curiosity rover landed on Mars way back in 2012, and it’s still rolling around, capturing new images all the time. At the end of February, the little rover spotted a tiny ‘flower’ on the martian planet roughly the size of a penny.While this isn’t an actual flower and more of a flower-shaped mineral deposit, it’s still an exciting discovery. According to NASA, it looks like a small coral or sponge and is likely a branching rock formed when the planet was still covered with water long ago.Curiosity snapped an image of the little rock pile on February 24 or 25th using the Mars Hand Lens Imager, a camera located on the end of its robotic arm. It’s located near Aeolis Mons, also known as Mount Sharp, near the center of the 96-mile-wide Gale Crater, where Curiosity has spent countless years roaming the surface.NASA says the crater could once have been a lake, and all the moisture would help form these odd formations and flower-like deposits. Some of NASA’s other exploratory devices have captured similar interesting images, such as these blueberry-shaped rocks in 2004.Curiosity has taken many photos on its long journey, shaping our understanding of what Mars’ surface looks like. For those wondering, Curiosity is nearing the end of its journey and has roamed the red planet for roughly ten years so far. Unfortunately, scientists say that its nuclear power system was only meant to last 14 years, so we’re not sure how many more photos we’ll get like this last one.That’s okay though because Perseverance Rover is there to keep exploring.via Live Science",https://www.reviewgeek.com/p/uploads/2022/03/19a34368.jpg?width=1200

Washington [US], March 6 (ANI): A new version of the iPad Air in the works though no design changes are expected.According to MacRumors, the next-generation iPad Air will continue to look like the current iPad Air, though there's a possibility we could see new colour options. Right now, the iPad Air comes in space grey, silver, rose gold, green, and blue.Also Read | Rumours suggest that much of the iPad Air update will focus on bringing the device in line with the sixth-generation iPad mini released last fall, so it is expected to get an updated A15 chip, which Apple added to the iPad mini after introducing it in the iPhone 13 models.For cellular iPad Air models, Apple will add 5G connectivity, so the updated devices will work with faster 5G networks. The chip in the iPad mini is limited to sub-6GHz 5G networks rather than the fastest mmWave 5G networks, so it's possible we could see this same limitation in the iPad Air.Also Read | The iPad Air will feature mostly internal changes, but it could get the same updated 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera that will work with Center Stage, a feature first introduced in the iPad Pro and the iPad mini 6.Pricing on the iPad Air is likely to stay the same, so the new model could be priced starting at USD 599 for 64GB storage.

The amount of times I make phone calls these days has decreased massively over the years - sending a message means you can still chat with friends and family but at a pace that’s more convenient. I also find I now only make calls when I’m doing something else to maximize my time - whether that’s sorting the washing while I’m on hold to a company, or because both myself and my partner are chatting to our families. But you might be surprised to learn that I make these calls on my Amazon Echo, and other Alexa smart speakers and smart displays in my home.It’s a better experience than using my smartphone on hands-free mode (something I started doing to reduce arm ache as well as ensure that both myself and my other half could hear the conversation). Even better than that,  it’s free of charge and doesn’t come out of my monthly calling allowance either. Alexa Calling, which is the name given to the feature on Amazon Echos that lets you make calls - isn’t new. It was first introduced in 2017 in the US and made its way to the UK a couple of months later but many Echo owners don’t even know it exists.Initially it wasn’t really a viable option for me as I spent most of my waking hours away from home, and my Amazon Echo. Then the pandemic hit, and like everyone else I was confined to the house, and my Amazon Echo speaker was closer than ever before. While my friends and brother were happy to engage in the ‘zoom boom’ when it came to staying in touch, my parents weren’t quite as comfortable video calling, and preferred traditional telephone calls. However, having got used to making far fewer phone calls over the years, it wasn’t long before my arm started to ache holding my, quite frankly hefty, iPhone 11 Pro Max for 30 minutes to an hour at a time. This also meant when I came off the phone, I had to repeat most of the conversation so my other half was up to speed with what had been discussed. We’ve found it’s far more efficient for us both to talk to the family together, something we started doing during the global pandemic and have carried on as life begins to revert back to normal. I tried using my smartphone on speaker, to ensure my other half could take part in the conversations too, but it meant balancing my handset precariously on the edge of the sofa, so we could both hear the conversation, and our recipients were able to hear us clearly too. However, as soon as one of us shifted position, the phone slipped down the crack between the sofa cushions, and the callers were left listening to our muffled voices panicking as we shoved our hands between the stiff cushioning.  All of these phone calls also meant my calling plan allowance took quite a beating. Prior to the pandemic I’d been someone that always prioritized mobile data over calling minutes  - a move, which I was beginning to regret. That’s when I realised the answer was right in front of me - my Amazon Echo. The Alexa Calling feature is available on any Amazon Echo smart speaker and Amazon Echo Show smart display. Although, you’ll need to give Alexa permission to access your contacts from your smartphone before you can use Alexa Calling. To this, open the Alexa smartphone app and tap on the Communicate icon in the lower-left corner of the screen. You’ll then be asked to verify your mobile phone number and grant permission for Alexa to make calls on your behalf. You’ll also be given the opportunity to  import contacts from your smartphone - you can either select the ones you want, or import then all in one go. Once you’ve done this, you can then make a call to any mobile or landline number, simply by using the command “Alexa call….” followed by the name of the contact you want to call or the telephone number, to your Amazon Echo. The calls are made using your Amazon Echo’s internet connection, which means your calling allowances won’t be affected and for those on pay as you go tariffs, you won’t be charged for these calls. However, there are some limitations, Alexa Calling won’t work if you want to call emergency or premium-rate numbers, and you can only call numbers in the US, UK, Canada and Mexico (these are the territories the feature is currently available).If you’re still struggling with Alexa Calling, follow our in–depth guide on In my lounge, my Amazon Echo (2020) is positioned on a coffee table directly in front of the sofa myself and my partner sit on when relaxing. This meant that we were both able to clearly hear what was being said during conversations with friends and family. Likewise, the far field microphones were able to clearly pick up both our voices so the recipients on our calls were able to understand us both easily too. This hands-free calling method ensured we were more comfortable, and put an end to any arm ache I endured during audio calls. The fact there were no charges for the calls was an added bonus too. In fact, Alexa Calling has proved so successful that as things are starting to get back to normal, I still use it as my go-to calling method, particularly if I know it's going to be a long conversation, or one that warrants both myself and my other half on the call. There’s a wide array of Amazon Echo smart speakers on the market, which may leave you wondering which is best if you plan to use Alexa Calling to make phone calls rather than your smartphone. Here’s our pick of the three best Echo devices. In our eyes, the best smart speaker for Alexa Calling is the Amazon Echo (4th generation). It strikes the right balance between price and sound quality - the Echo Dot just can't complete here when it comes to hearing your caller clearly across large rooms. On test, it was responsive at picking up our voice too, thanks to the six built-in microphones, and it's a relatively compact smart speaker, so won't dominate your room. However, the futuristic look may be a bit too out there for some homes, and if you're looking for a speaker that also doubles as a great way to listen to your favorite albums, this isn't going to suffice. Read our full review: Amazon EchoIf you want the best-sounding Amazon Echo for Alexa Calling, then you'll be hard pushed to do better than the Echo Studio. On test, we were seriously impressed by the sound quality, and the fact you can pair two together for stereo sound.The Echo Studio also supports 3D music  - a directional sound format that makes it feel like you're listening to a live performance with different aspects of the track such as voices and instruments coming from different directions, although this does require a subscription. It's also the bulkiest Amazon Echo speaker on the market right now but it can act as a Zigbee hub making it great for smart home devices.  Read our full review: Amazon Echo StudioIf you move around the room a lot during calls, then the Amazon Echo Show 10 is the best device for Alexa Calling. The screen rotates as you move so it's always within view. As the microphone is located in the screen, then it's always close enough to pick up your voice clearly during calls.There's a built-in high-quality camera if you prefer video calling, and it can even act as a Zigbee hub so you control an array of compatible smart home devices, even if they're from different manufacturers.However, it's the most expensive smart display Amazon offers, and the audio is bass-heavy, which means it may not offer the best experience when using it to listen to your favorite tracks.Read our full review: Amazon Echo Show 10Carrie-Ann Skinner is Homes Editor at TechRadar, and has more than two decades of experience in both online and print journalism, with 13 years of that spent covering all-things tech.

Whether you’re the Chosen Undead, Ashen one, or Tarnished, almost everyone — and everything — in a Souls game is out to get you. In Elden Ring, that list of enemies is the biggest yet. Roaming around the open world, you will be beset by knights, dogs, bears, birds, and all manner of strange and eldritch creatures. Many of these enemies are grouped up, perhaps even roaming around in convoys, showing that they have at least some sense of awareness and intelligence to not attack their companions.You will want and sometimes need to exploit every advantage you can get to make it through some of the tougher areas in Elden Ring. The difficulty of the enemies, and the almost maniacal placement of some ambushes, all are meant to test you every step of the way. What if you were able to turn the tides on the game, though? It’s never been possible, outside the use of very limited and rare items, to pit enemies against one another in Souls games, but with the open nature of Elden Ring, is it possible? Here’s the answer.The answer to this question is a little murky. On one hand, no, enemies will not, outside of scripted areas of the game, target one another instead of all focusing their aggression on the player. Unless you’re in one of these specific areas, such as optional castles in the open world, you won’t see any random enemies or groups engaged in battle with each other or even wild animals. There also doesn’t appear, at least as far as we’ve discovered, to be any items that will turn an enemy against their allies.On the other hand, enemies can, and will, deal damage to each other if hit by a big attack. The most obvious example is with the giant enemies. If you’ve got a giant after you, plus some foot soldiers, you can easily bait out the giant to smash and slam on the other enemies to clear them out before taking the big guy on one on one. Getting normal enemies to hit each other is much more difficult unless they have some area of effect spells or something similar, so your best bet is still to try and draw single enemies to fight at a time rather than groups and hope that they chip away at each other.A major exception to this seems to be bosses. Whenever there are two bosses in a single encounter, they won’t be able to hurt the other, even with giant swings or area of effect spells. Bosses can hurt summoned mobs, though, which is a nice concession at least.", https://www.verdict.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/shutterstock_1583248045.jpg
