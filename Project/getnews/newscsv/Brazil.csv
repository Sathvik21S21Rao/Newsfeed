"Rams HC Sean McVay on upset loss to 49ers: 'This was a humbling night' - NFL.com
NFL.com Digital Content EditorThough the game was in Santa Clara, California, it certainly had the feel of a Hollywood premiere.Under the Monday night lights and upon the prime-time stage, Odell Beckham and Von Miller made their Los Angeles Rams debuts.However, as the Rams were ready to roll out the red carpet, the underdog San Francisco 49ers were hardly ready to roll over and showed it with a physical, run-based attack from the start that led them to a 31-10 upset.""This was a humbling night for us,"" Rams head coach Sean McVay said.All in on their Super Bowl aspirations, the Rams (7-3) are sitting in second place in the NFC West after losing to the rival 49ers (4-5) for the fifth straight time.Not only was it an upset loss, but it was one in which the 49ers grounded and pounded their way to victory, running the ball 44 times for 156 yards. They were more often than not the more physical team on each side of the ball and it showed from the onset, when San Francisco took over after a Jimmie Ward interception and proceeded to run it right down the Rams' throats for a 7-0 lead it would never relinquish.It was an 18-play, 93-yard odyssey of an opening drive for the 49ers that took 11 minutes, 3 seconds of game clock and perhaps took something more from the Rams.""It's the way we want to do it,"" said 49ers quarterback Jimmy GaroppoloÔªø, who ended the opening march with an 8-yard touchdown pass to George KittleÔªø. ""I don't want to say it took their soul away, but it definitely did something.""Following that soul-crushing opening salvo by the 49ers, Ward had yet another interception, returning this one for a touchdown when a Matthew Stafford pass was dropped by Tyler Higbee and cradled by Ward. The start was emphatic and methodical, and quick and staggering.""We wanted to make it as physical as possible and we knew if we did that, it would come down to the turnover battle,"" said 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan, whose team won the turnover battle, 2-0, thanks to Ward's two interceptions.The 49ers had forced their will, while the Rams seemed to have lost theirs.It was hardly following the script, as the 49ers, reeling all season, were supposed to be the first foe vanquished by the new-age band of Rams with Beckham and Miller adding to the all-star cast that is the Los Angeles roster. But it didn't go that way.Los Angeles, despite its additions over the last few weeks, has lost two in row to the Titans and 49ers, with each defeat coming by double-digit margins and the Rams' high-octane offense held to an average of 13 points.""I choose to believe that these last couple weeks are not who we are. I refuse to believe that, event that, you know what, you're only as good as your last game,"" McVay said. ""These last two weeks have certainly been humbling.""Heading into Monday, this game was very much all about the Rams and the hopeful debuts of Miller and Beckham, but the Niners apparently didn't get the memo.Stafford wasted no time in getting Beckham introduced to the Rams offense, hooking up with the former Browns and Giants wideout on the first play from scrimmage for a 5-yard gain. Unfortunately, Beckham tallied his first tackle as a Ram on the drive when a Stafford deep ball was intercepted. It appeared that Beckham and Stafford might not have been on the same page on the play. Perhaps Beckham didn't run the deep route Stafford expected or perhaps it was just a bad ball.""We didn't make enough plays,"" said McVay, whose team lost the time of possession battle, 39:03-20:57. ""Our best players didn't play up to their standards.""Stafford hooked up with Higbee for the Rams' only touchdown of the evening to cut the score to 14-7, but the 49ers responded with an 11-play, 91-yard scoring drive, underscoring that this was San Francisco's night and their style of game.""We were ready to play them today and we were excited to,"" Shanahan said.At one point, Jalen Ramsey could be seen yelling on the sidelines, while Miller was getting oxygen on the bench.When the loss had settled, Beckham and Miller, each downplayed it, simply chalking it up to a bad night against a team that played better.""Any given Sunday any team can win,"" Beckham said. ""Tonight, the Niners came out and they played better than us in all phases of the game. And that's really the moral of the story. There's no trying to find what happened, they just outplayed us.""Plenty of eyes were on Beckham, though. In six games with the Browns this season, he averaged 2.8 catches on 5.7 targets for 38.7 yards per game. In his Rams debut, he had two catches on three targets for 18 yards.""I was excited. Felt like I was ready for the moment,"" Beckham said. ""I've been through so much and God has put me in this position for that exact moment. And it just wasn't our night. There's really no way around it, it just wasn't our night.""""It's definitely been a movie, it's definitely been a good movie. Today was a bad scene, but I feel like we'll be able to fight out of this, I feel like we'll be able to recover from this,"" Miller said. ""But having Odell on this team, it's great. That's my buddy, on an off the football field. We continue to gel, I continue to gel. And I'm exciting. Losing is definitely not fun, but playing today was fun. Going out there and feeling myself move around and be quick and have some great rushes; I had fun today. I'm gonna gather myself, take the good and the bad and go into this bye week and figure it out. I feel excited about this football team, I feel excited about what we can do.""This one definitely went off-script.The 49ers aren't yet done this season and the Rams clearly haven't won the Super Bowl in November no matter how many big names they have on their roster.As Monday night beckoned, everyone was tuning in to see the new-look Rams, the star-studded Super Bowl contenders.When Monday night concluded, everyone saw the 49ers that many envisioned would be Super Bowl contenders before the season began.Said McVay: ""It's only going to take as much of a toll as we allow it to.""Said Shanahan: ""We need to start expecting some more games like that.""Once upon a time in the wild NFC West, things got a whole lot more interesting on Monday night.See all the ActionReplay every game all season.",https://res.cloudinary.com/stage-nflclubs/image/upload/49ers/f6b7udz3xm3jglfakq9q.svg,"China pleads ignorance amid calls to investigate tennis star Peng Shuai's whereabouts after sexual assault claim - Yahoo Sports

It‚Äôs hard to believe it, but a month has already passed in the 2021-22 NBA season. And even though the Golden State Warriors enter the second month of action coming off of a loss, they‚Äôre feeling pretty darn good about their record.They‚Äôve been the best team in the NBA through the first four weeks, and that‚Äôs without Klay Thompson. Permission for optimism granted.Now let‚Äôs recap the week that was, and look forward to the week that will be.Record: 11-2Standing: 1st seed in the Western ConferenceOffensive rating: 3rd (112.9)Defensive rating: 1st (100.4)Net rating: 1st (+12.5)Team ratings are garbage-time adjusted, courtesy of Cleaning The Glass.Monday: Wednesday: Friday: Sunday: Three wins by a combined 53 points, and a lone four-point loss? If you can‚Äôt have a perfect week, that‚Äôs perhaps the next best thing. The Dubs certainly started things in style with a trio of dominant victories, culminating in a 26-point beatdown of the Chicago Bulls, who look like a team capable of making a deep playoff run.So the week ended in defeat ... who cares? They happen. We‚Äôll take three big steps forward and one little step back every week of the season. Steph Curry vs. the Hawks: 50 points, 7 rebounds, 10 assists, 4 steals, 1 block, 14-for-28 shooting, 9-for-19 threes, 13-for-13 free throws.Curry had a few low-scoring games as the Dubs coasted to victories, and then he took matters into his own hands against Atlanta, as if to remind everyone who he is, and what he‚Äôs capable of. And my goodness is he capable of a lot. 50 points and 10 assists? Plus an overflowing handful of rebounds from the point guard position, and a stellar defensive game?It was the best performance of the season. Not for Curry. Not for the Warriors. For the NBA. Honorable mention goes to...Andrew Wiggins vs. the Wolves: 35 points, 4 rebounds, 2 steals, 14-for-19 shooting, 3-for-6 threes, 4-for-4 free throws.Did Wiggins decide to take something out on his former team, or did he just happen to have  one of his best games in a Warriors jersey against the organization he played the first 442 games of his career for? We may never know, but what matters is he was utterly unstoppable on offense.And while we‚Äôre on the topic of Wiggins being unstoppable against the Timberwolves...OH MY WIGGINS Yeah, we‚Äôre gonna need to see some alternate angles and bench reactions for that one ...ARE YOU KIDDING ANDREW WIGGINS?! Tuesday: @ Brooklyn Nets (10-4), 4:30 p.m. PTThursday: @ Cleveland Cavaliers (9-5), 4:30 p.m. PTFriday: @ Detroit Pistons (3-9), 4:00 p.m. PTSunday: vs. Toronto Raptors (7-7), 5:00 p.m. PTIt‚Äôs another four-game week, and this time it‚Äôs only against Eastern Conference teams.Friday vs. the Pistons.Back ends of a road back-to-back are never easy, especially when capping off a four-game road trip. But when you look at the quality of the teams the Warriors are up against, the Pistons stand out a bit, and not in the good way.Truthfully, Detroit already having three wins is a bit surprising to me, though it‚Äôs worth noting that two of their wins (against the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic) came against two of the only three teams with a worse record.Detroit is running with a starting lineup of Killian Hayes, Cade Cunningham, Saddiq Bey, Jerami Grant, and Isaiah Stewart. If you‚Äôre familiar with those five players, then congratulations: you are a hard, hardcore NBA fan.Tuesday vs. the Nets.Is this even a question? The Nets have the fourth-best record in the league, and the fifth-best net rating.More importantly, they have Kevin Durant and James Harden. , the community correctly predicted a 3-1 week, with 46% of poll responders choosing that option.

"Booster shots against COVID-19 'are a bit of a distraction,' doctor says - AOL
While COVID-19 booster shot eligibility is continuing to expand in the U.S., not all doctors believe that‚Äôs where the focus should be in the fight against the coronavirus.‚ÄúHonestly, I think that boosters right now are a bit of a distraction away from where we should be focused, which is getting first doses, especially since we know that even now, even with Delta surging, the primary doses of the vaccines are highly protective against serious infection, against hospitalization,‚Äù Dr. Anand Swaminathan, a New Jersey-based emergency medicine physician, said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above).In most states, booster shots are available for those over the age of 65, people with certain underlying medical conditions, and people working in occupations considered to be higher risk in accordance with CDC guidelines.‚ÄúThese boosters will temporarily increase the antibodies that are circulating which then temporarily will improve our effectiveness against fighting COVID in any form,‚Äù Swaminathan said. ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt really give us the long-term immunity that we‚Äôre looking for, doesn‚Äôt really boost that as much, or at least we don‚Äôt know that it does.""Currently, 58.5% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated while 67.7% have received at least one dose. (13.4% of those who are fully vaccinated have received a booster shot.)¬†As part of an effort to ramp up vaccinations, President Biden recently announced that companies with more than 100 employees will need to require their workers to get vaccinated or submit to weekly testing. The requirement is currently blocked by a federal appeals court.This comes as the country recently surpassed 46.6 million coronavirus cases and 755,000 deaths. A report out of Texas found that unvaccinated individuals in the state were 40 times more likely to die from COVID in 2021 than those who were fully vaccinated.But breakthrough cases have become more common due to the virulence of the Delta variant, which is where booster shots come into the conversation.¬†Though extensive details haven't been shared yet, preliminary data from Pfizer indicated that ""receiving an additional booster dose of their COVID-19 vaccine after having had the initial two doses increases the amount of Delta variant antibodies five-fold in 18- to 55-year-olds and 11-fold in 65- to 85-year-olds,"" according to Medical News Today.However, Swaminathan doesn‚Äôt think that boosters are ‚Äúreally going to affect very much‚Äù for several reasons.‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre looking to prevent is the hospitalizations and the serious infections, and we don‚Äôt know that boosters really do that,‚Äù Swaminathan said. ‚ÄúOn top of that, we‚Äôve got some data out of the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that the groups of people that are getting boosters tend to be higher socioeconomic status, they tend to be whiter, they tend to be older.‚ÄùAnd with the exception of those who are older, he added, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not really seeing booster uptake being very high in the higher-risk population. So boosters aren‚Äôt really getting to those that are higher risk.‚ÄùRather than using resources towards distributing booster shots that may not be fully effective, efforts should be directed towards getting first doses in individuals both in the U.S. and around the world, Swaminathan argued.‚ÄúRight now, the U.S. is administering more boosters than many countries are administering any kind of vaccine, any level of vaccination,‚Äù Swaminathan said. ‚ÄúAnd until we get better vaccine equity globally, we‚Äôre not really going to be able to fight this pandemic. We‚Äôre going to see more deaths and more dangerous variants.‚ÄùAdriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

Alec Baldwin is being made a scapegoat in the fatal ""Rust"" shooting because of political views ... at least according to his brother.Daniel Baldwin appeared Monday on ""The Domenick Nati Show"" ... and during the radio hit, he said his brother should NOT be taking the blame for the fatal incident on set.The way Daniel sees it ... Alec is being scapegoated because he's the big star with outspoken political views, making for an easy target.Daniel says ... ""You know Alec's got the name though doesn't he, so let's go ahead and take Alec for his political views and the many, many wonderful things he's done for different charities and people and his wife and let's see if we can't sensationalize this and go after Alec.""DB adds ... ""This is what he faces because he's opinionated and he's strong-headed and he has really staunch views on certain things and those people who don't like him will take advantage of him and persecute his wife. He's a target.""How very Christian of you. While Daniel doesn't go into Alec's political views, it's no secret Alec did not like Donald Trump, often imitating the former President on 'SNL,' and endorsing Barack Obama back in the day.Remember ... one of the first to publicly pile on Alec was Donald Trump Jr., who posted t-shirts reading, ""Guns don't kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people.""While it seems Don Jr.'s actions support Daniel's scapegoating theory, it's worth noting the District Attorney investigating the case in New Mexico, Mary Carmack-Altwies, is a Democrat.Instead, Daniel says the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, is responsible for the death of Halyna Hutchins ... along with assistant director Dave Halls.In Daniel's eyes, Alec is exonerated by the fact folks on set told police Halls announced the gun he handed AB was ""cold,"" meaning it did not have live ammunition.As you know it was a fatal mistake ... the revolver in Alec's hands turned out to have live ammo.Daniel says the buck stops with the armorer, but he's wondering why Halls said it was a ""cold"" gun if Halls didn't verify it ... and he thinks it's clear rules weren't being followed on set.Daniel says Alec really liked Halyna and had spent some time with her family ... and we saw Alec with the family in the wake of the shooting.No charges have been filed and no arrests have been made ... but Daniel believes when the dust settles AB won't be the one going to jail.Bottom line for Daniel ... the actors are just on set to act, and they're not the ones responsible for guns on set.",https://imagez.tmz.com/image/69/4by3/2021/11/16/693b52d974b4450da2be69cfac4347f6_md.jpg
"NASA will spend $93 billion on Artemis moon program by 2025, report estimates - Space.com
Putting boots on the moon is an expensive proposition.NASA's spending on its Artemis program, which aims to establish a sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the decade, is projected to reach a total of $93 billion by 2025, according to a new audit by the NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG).""Moreover, while NASA has several initiatives underway aimed at increasing affordability, we project the current production cost of a single SLS/Orion system to be $4.1 billion per launch,"" the OIG report states, referring to the Orion crew capsule and Space Launch System rocket, which are core Artemis elements.""Looking ahead, without capturing, accurately reporting and reducing the cost of future SLS/Orion missions, the Agency will face significant challenges to sustaining its Artemis program in its current configuration,"" adds the 73-page report, which was released Monday (Nov. 15).For comparison, the U.S. spent $28 billion on NASA's Apollo moon program between 1960 and 1973, . That's about $280 billion in today's dollars.Related:Although the Artemis program was first announced in December 2017, development of Orion and the SLS officially began in 2011. So the OIG report's $93 billion estimate encompasses more than a decade of spending, from fiscal year (FY) 2012 through fiscal year 2025. (On the U.S. government's calendar, fiscal years start on Oct. 1 and end on Sept. 30. FY2012, for example, began on Oct. 1, 2011.)The original plan to return to the moon called for landing astronauts near the moon's south pole for the first time by 2028. In March 2019, however, the administration of President Donald Trump accelerated things, re-targeting the first crewed lunar landing since the Apollo days for 2024 and dubbing the initiative the Artemis program.That revised timeline was widely viewed within the space community as overly ambitious, and NASA is no longer working toward it: Last week, agency chief Bill Nelson announced that the first crewed Artemis landing will likely take place no earlier than 2025.And 2025 may be out of reach as well. The new OIG report, which was apparently written before Nelson's announcement, estimates that NASA will miss the Trump administration's late-2024 landing goal ""by several years."" The audit cites the need to develop and test new Artemis spacesuits, which are behind schedule, and the program's Human Landing System (HLS), which will ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface.In April 2021, NASA selected SpaceX to provide the initial Artemis HLS, which will be a version of the company's huge Starship vehicle. However, two companies that lost out on the HLS contract, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Dynetics, filed protests with the OIG just after the award was announced. Those protests were denied in July, but Blue Origin then filed a lawsuit, which was dismissed earlier this month. So work under the Starship HLS contract is basically just now getting started.¬†‚ÄîNASA's Artemis program 
‚Äî 
‚ÄîThe first crewed Artemis landing mission is called Artemis 3, because it will be the third launch in the program. The first, Artemis 1, will send an uncrewed Orion on a journey around the moon. Artemis 2 will also be a circumlunar mission, but with astronauts aboard.¬†NASA is targeting February 2022 for the launch of Artemis 1. But the OIG report is less bullish, estimating that the mission ""will be ready to launch by summer 2022.""Such Artemis delays have multiple causes, according to the report, from technical challenges to the COVID-19 pandemic to extreme weather events. This past August, for example,  in Louisiana, which builds the core stage for the SLS.In addition, the HLS and another Artemis element, the moon-orbiting space station known as Gateway, received less money from Congress in FY2021 ""than required to meet NASA‚Äôs initial acquisition strategy,"" the report notes.The OIG report makes nine recommendations to Jim Free, who as NASA's associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Development (ESD) Mission Directorate is overseeing Artemis. This advice is designed to improve the ""accuracy, transparency and safety of human spaceflight.""¬†The space agency concurred completely or partially with all but two of the recommendations. Those two were ""develop an Artemis-wide cost estimate and update it on an annual basis"" and ""maintain an accounting of per-mission costs and establish a benchmark against which NASA can assess the outcome of initiatives to increase the affordability of ESD systems.""The new audit focuses on the Artemis program's schedule, its projected costs and how NASA's acquisition and programmatic strategies affect the coming moonshot. It was conducted from December 2020 through November 2021, OIG officials said.The new report is the second in a series directly assessing the Artemis program. Over the past five years, however, the OIG and the Government Accountability Office have released 21 reports ""of significant relevance to the subject of this report,"" the audit states.Mike Wall is the author of ""Out There"" (Grand Central Publishing, 2018; illustrated by Karl Tate), a book about the search for alien life.

Within a diamond hauled from deep beneath Earth's surface, scientists have discovered the first example of a never-before-seen mineral.Named davemaoite after prominent geophysicist Ho-kwang (Dave) Mao, the mineral is the first example of a high-pressure calcium silicate perovskite (CaSiO3) found on Earth. Another form of CaSiO3, known as wollastonite, is commonly found across the globe, but davemaoite has a crystalline structure that forms only under high pressure and high temperatures in Earth's mantle, the mainly solid layer of Earth trapped between the outer core and the crust.Davemaoite has long been expected to be an abundant and geochemically important mineral in Earth's mantle. But scientists have never found any direct evidence of its existence because it breaks down into other minerals when it moves toward the surface and pressure decreases. However, analysis of a diamond from Botswana, which formed in the mantle around 410 miles (660 kilometers) below Earth's surface, has revealed a sample of intact davemaoite trapped inside. As a result, the International Mineralogical Association has now confirmed davemaoite as a new mineral.Related: ""The discovery of davemaoite came as a surprise,"" lead author Oliver Tschauner, a mineralogist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told Live Science.¬†Tschauner and his colleagues uncovered the davemaoite sample with a technique known as synchrotron X-ray diffraction, which focuses a high-energy beam of X-rays on certain spots within the diamond with microscopic precision. By measuring the angle and intensity of the returning light, researchers can decipher what's inside, Tschauner said. The sample of davemaoite within the diamond was just a few micrometers (millionths of a meter) in size, so less-powerful sampling techniques would have missed it, he added.Davemaoite is believed to play an important geochemical role in Earth's mantle. Scientists theorize that the mineral may also contain other trace elements, including uranium and thorium, which release heat via radioactive decay. Therefore, davemaoite may help to generate a substantial amount of heat in the mantle, Tschauner said.In a 2014 study published in the journal Science, researchers described another theoretical high-pressure mineral from the mantle, known as bridgmanite. However, the sample of bridgmanite did not originate from the mantle but rather inside a meteorite. The discovery of davemaoite shows that diamonds can form farther down in the mantle than previously thought, and it suggests that they might be the best place to look for more new minerals from the mantle, Tschauner said.‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî""The work by Tschauner et al. inspires hope in the discovery of other difficult high-pressure phases in nature,"" Yingwei Fe, a geophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the study, said in a related Science article. ""Such direct sampling of the inaccessible lower mantle would fill our knowledge gap in chemical composition of the entire mantle of our planet.""The study was published online Nov. 11 in the journal Science.Originally published on Live Science. to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

It might be hotter than lava but superionic ice is not on fire.¬†Image Credit: Stewart Scott/Shutterstock.comIf you think of very low temperatures, there's a good chance you are picturing ice. Ice is a quintessential ""cold"" thing for us. But at extreme pressures, like in the core of large planets, something peculiar can happen. Ice can remain solid but have a temperature hotter than the surface of the Sun.This type of water ice is called ""superionic ice"" and has been added to the list of around 20 phases water can structurally form, including ice, liquid, and vapor. Now, researchers report in Nature Physics¬†the discovery and characterization of two superionic ice phases, having found a way of reliably and stably recreating the ice for longer than¬†has¬†previously been achieved¬†to be able to study it.¬†One superionic phase extends between 200,000 and 600,00 times the atmospheric pressure at sea level and at a temperature of several hundred to over 1,000¬∞C. The other phase extends to half the pressure experienced at the center of the Earth and with temperatures of thousands of degrees.‚ÄúIt was a surprise ‚Äî everyone thought this phase wouldn‚Äôt appear until you are at much higher pressures than where we first find it,‚Äù co-author Vitali Prakapenka, a University of Chicago research professor and beamline scientist at the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory, said in a statement. ‚ÄúBut we were able to very accurately map the properties of this new ice, which constitutes a new phase of matter, thanks to several powerful tools.‚ÄùAt higher temperatures and incredible pressures, the ice remains solid but the atomic structure is dramatically shifted. Once the pressure and temperature are removed though, the ice return to its regular state.‚ÄúImagine a cube, a lattice with oxygen atoms at the corners connected by hydrogen,‚Äù Prakapenka said. ‚ÄúWhen it transforms into this new superionic phase, the lattice expands, allowing the hydrogen atoms to migrate around while the oxygen atoms remain steady in their positions. It‚Äôs kind of like a solid oxygen lattice sitting in an ocean of floating hydrogen atoms.‚ÄùSuperionic ice is less dense than regular ice, which we know already to be less dense than liquid water. It also changes color. While water ice can be transparent to cloudy white, depending on how it freezes, superionic ice is darker as it interacts with light differently.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new state of matter, so it basically acts as a new material, and it may be different from what we thought,‚Äù Prakapenka said.Planetary scientists believe similar extreme conditions in pressure and temperatures might exist inside Neptune and Uranus, as well as other ice giant planets beyond the Solar System. Understanding the properties of superionic ice might help us understand the properties of these planets.This website uses cookiesThis website uses cookies to improve user experience.

"6 Winners and 5 Losers from the Sao Paulo Grand Prix ‚Äì Who bossed it in Brazil? - Formula 1 RSS UK
Lewis Hamilton made up a total of 25 places in 95 laps (across the F1 Sprint and Grand Prix) to leave Brazil with his 101st victory in his pocket. We‚Äôve picked out our six winners and five losers from a scintillating weekend at Interlagos‚Ä¶Before Brazil, just one of seven-time world champion Hamilton‚Äôs 100 victories ‚Äì in 284 starts ‚Äì had come from outside the top six on the grid (he triumphed from 14th in Germany in 2018).He made that two at Interlagos, cutting through from 10th on the grid to take his sixth win of the season. It was the biggest comeback drive the venue had ever seen ‚Äì no one had previously won from lower than eighth.It was also only his second win since the summer break, leaving him just 14 points adrift of Verstappen in the drivers‚Äô championship and 107 still to play for with three races to go.Second in Brazil was Max Verstappen‚Äôs 15th top-two finish in 19 attempts this year, but it was not the step of the podium the Dutchman was targeting ahead of the weekend.He declared himself ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù with the result and has Red Bull team mate Sergio Perez to thank for stealing the fastest lap point off Hamilton at the death to minimise the championship loss.Verstappen leaves Brazil with his lead intact, albeit slimmer than he would have hoped, but a wallet that is substantially lighter  for examining Hamilton‚Äôs rear wing in Parc Ferme after qualifying.Ferrari are on an immense run of form, the Scuderia getting both cars into the top eight for the fourth successive race. With Charles Leclerc fifth and Carlos Sainz sixth, they scored 18 points in a Grand Prix for the third time in succession.It was Leclerc‚Äôs 10th top-five finish, while Sainz extended the longest active points streak of any driver to 12 races. Their collective haul puts Ferrari 31.5 points clear of McLaren in the fight for P3 in the constructors' championship.Daniel Ricciardo showed better pace in the Grand Prix than in Saturday‚Äôs F1 Sprint, which allowed him to move himself into the top 10 and contention for points.But a loss of power forced his first retirement of the season and first since Austria 2020. It ends a 34-race finishing streak and leaves him with just one points finish in the last four races.Mercedes may have had the fastest car at Interlagos, but their weekend was set to be a tricky one from the moment they decided to fit Hamilton‚Äôs car with a fresh engine, triggering a five-place grid penalty.It got harder when he was disqualified from qualifying for a rear wing infringement. But Bottas did his job on Saturday, winning the Sprint, with Hamilton recovering to a brilliant fifth.Then on Sunday, Hamilton made up nine places to win, while Bottas recovered from a poor start from pole to take his first podium since Turkey and give Mercedes their first double podium since the Netherlands. They now lead Red Bull by 11 points.Yuki Tsunoda and his AlphaTauri team went aggressive as the only ones to start the race on the soft tyre ‚Äì with everyone else on the more durable mediums.There was better news for the other AlphaTauri, with Pierre Gasly‚Äôs impressive 2021 campaign continuing. The Frenchman pulled of a string of overtakes, including on the Alpines of Fernando Alonso and Esteban Ocon, to finish seventh.That‚Äôs his 13th points finish of the season and moves him four points away from his highest ever season total in F1. His score also ensured AlphaTauri remain locked on the same points with Alpine in the constructors‚Äô championship.There have been highs and lows for Mick Schumacher in his rookie season and Brazil was one of those races that saw a bit of both.He made a good start to run three places higher than his grid slot in 15th, but misjudged a pass on Kimi Raikkonen at Turn 1, making contact with the Alfa Romeo that broke his front wing.He cruised back to the pits and fitted a new nose, but he had lost a bunch of time and faced a lonely race thereafter.Sure, Bottas wasn‚Äôt able to convert pole into victory, but he recovered well from a poor getaway, first moving aside to allow title chasing team mate Hamilton through, then showing strong enough pace that when the VSC was thrown, he was in a position to benefit and leapfrog Perez for the final podium spot.By beating Perez he ensured a decent points haul with Hamilton for Mercedes that extends their constructors‚Äô championship lead. It was his second podium in five races and that moves him 25 clear of Perez in the fight for P3 in the drivers‚Äô standings.This was Lando Norris‚Äô seventh successive points finish, but it‚Äôs a measure of how far he‚Äôs come that a single point for the second successive race is hugely disappointing.The Briton made gains in Saturday‚Äôs Sprint and was set to make more progress over the line after an electric getaway, but he made contact with his friend and former team mate Carlos Sainz that gave him a puncture and dropped him to the back.That he recovered to the top 10 showed how much pace he had, but with Ricciardo failing to finish, it has dented McLaren‚Äôs hope of beating Ferrari to finish third in the constructors‚Äô championship.There‚Äôs always a lot of love for F1 from the Brazilian fans, and this year was no different. Fans streamed into the circuit in their thousands, creating a carnival atmosphere.They have taken Hamilton under their wing, the Briton making no secret of how much inspiration he has taken from their hero Ayrton Senna. With no Brazilians on the grid, they have made Hamilton one of their own.They were rewarded with one of the finest performances F1 has ever seen, the crowd cheering his every pass and exploding into celebration when he secured a fantastic comeback victory.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"10 things we learned from 2021's Brazilian Grand Prix - Motorsport.com
Interlagos has hosted its fair share of Formula 1 classics through the years, but Sunday‚Äôs Brazilian Grand Prix was one that will live long in the memory.It proved to be a dramatic weekend both on and off the track, but it was Lewis Hamilton who took victory to cut Max Verstappen‚Äôs lead at top of the drivers‚Äô championship down to 14 points.Hamilton did it the hard way, recovering from a qualifying exclusion on Friday that left him last on the grid for the sprint race before fighting his way up the order, capping off his recovery with another spirited wheel-to-wheel battle against Verstappen.It stoked the fire not only between the two world championship rivals, but also between their respective Mercedes and Red Bull squads as F1‚Äôs top teams renewed their political rivalry.Here are 10 things we learned from the 2021 Brazilian Grand Prix.Hamilton has always thrived in the face of adversity, but the fashion in which he fought back in Brazil last weekend surely makes this one of his greatest F1 victories.The pace of his Mercedes was undeniably a cut above that of Verstappen‚Äôs Red Bull. But to have passed every single car in the field - and some of them twice, thanks to the five-place grid penalty applied for the grand prix for taking a fresh engine¬†- in the space of two days is an astonishing achievement, no matter what way you look at it.Hamilton planned his moves wisely, meaning he avoided getting caught up in any incidents or drama that may have unfolded. He was particularly sensible when passing the two Red Bulls, backing out of a possible move around the outside of Verstappen at Turn 4 before completing the overtake one lap later, having learned a lesson from being forced off-track earlier (which we will get to later).Hamilton could have easily let the setbacks throughout the weekend weigh heavy on his shoulders. Instead, as he has such a tendency to do, he channelled it into giving himself more to fight for, making it one of the best of his 101 grand prix wins.The key swing between Red Bull and Mercedes at Interlagos was the straightline speed advantage that Hamilton - armed with his new engine - enjoyed.It made Turn 1 an easy spot for Hamilton to get his overtakes done, with the additional help of DRS allowing him to enjoy a speed advantage of over 25km/h against other cars before hitting the brakes.All weekend long, though, Red Bull had been expressing intrigue in how Mercedes was achieving such a huge top speed. Technical chief Adrian Newey met with the FIA to discuss the Mercedes rear wing earlier in the weekend, while Verstappen‚Äôs fine-inducing touches on Hamilton‚Äôs rear wing in parc ferme was motivated by a desire to see ‚Äúhow much the rear wing was flexing at that point‚Äù.Red Bull boss Christian Horner said the pace difference was something for Red Bull to try and understand, but that the team would ‚Äúkeep an eye‚Äù on Mercedes‚Äô rear wing amid its ‚Äúmind-boggling‚Äù speed.Should Hamilton and Mercedes be able to carry the pace over to the final three races, it could be a decisive swing in the title race if Red Bull cannot respond.Toto Wolff said after Sunday‚Äôs race in Brazil that ‚Äúdiplomacy has ended‚Äù¬†following a fraught weekend that saw Mercedes spend as much time in the stewards‚Äô room as it did with cars on-track.Mercedes called the decision to exclude Hamilton from qualifying ‚Äúharsh‚Äù, noting how damaged parts can typically be fixed under parc ferme conditions¬†- something Red Bull has done with its rear wing at the last three races - and that it didn‚Äôt have the chance to analyse the damage because the part was impounded.Red Bull, predictably, saw it differently, saying that it was a black-and-white binary case of a part either complying with the technical checks or not.Wolff made clear that Mercedes would now be keeping an even more eagle eye on its rivals in the event of any breaches.‚ÄúIf the modus operandi is different now, you maybe need to look at others also with a more strict eye and severe eye,‚Äù he said on Saturday before making reference to Red Bull‚Äôs recent parc ferme wing changes on Sunday.After all of the back-and-forth between Mercedes and Red Bull earlier this year over flexi-wings and the Hamilton/Verstappen clashes, this looks set to be the final round of fireworks to close out the season.In a weekend not short of flash points, the biggest of Sunday‚Äôs race centred around Verstappen‚Äôs robust defence while battling Hamilton at Turn 4.In the eyes of television commentators, Mercedes and a swathe of fans, Verstappen had crossed the line and was lucky to avoid a penalty for running himself and Hamilton wide onto the run off at Turn 4 while defending Hamilton‚Äôs attempted pass around the outside.Curiously, it didn‚Äôt warrant an investigation by the stewards as race director Michael Masi took a ‚Äúlet them race‚Äù approach¬†- despite admitting after the race that the incident almost warranted a black and white flag, which seems somewhat of a contradiction.The decision not to award a penalty, described as ‚Äúlaughable‚Äù by Mercedes boss Wolff, was taken without race control seeing onboard vision which could determine if Verstappen had attempted to make the corner. Verstappen blamed his Turn 4 wash out on worn tyres.A warning was issued to Verstappen for weaving in his defence on the straight towards Turn 4, outlining the robust nature of his defensive driving, but the call was again baffling when no investigation was called for the earlier near miss.The third and final sprint race of the 2021 season offered far more action than either Silverstone or Monza - but much of that was because of Hamilton‚Äôs charge, not the format itself.The fact this was a sprint weekend certainly helped Hamilton‚Äôs recovery (even if critics could argue it also denied the full fightback coming in the race), and he proved that it is possible to have the kind of flat-out overtake-fest that F1 so dearly want the sprints to be.But that all depends on cars being out of position. Sergio Perez spent most of the sprint race lurking just behind Carlos Sainz, but admitted afterwards he did not feel he could take a risk to make a pass as he would in the race because there is too much to lose.F1 certainly has tweaks to make to the format as it looks to expand it to more races next year, but the ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô of Saturday shouldn‚Äôt be taken as an overwhelming win for the format as a whole. If anything, Hamilton‚Äôs fight through the field lends greater strength to the argument that - whisper it - reverse grids would provide the kind of Saturday excitement desired, albeit artificially.His antics in parc ferme have an entire Subreddit dedicated to them, but Inspector Seb - Sebastian Vettel‚Äôs post-session, car-snooping alter-ego - may be no more after this weekend‚Äôs controversy.Whether it‚Äôs checking out Hamilton and Perez‚Äôs cars after qualifying in Monaco this year, or peering under the Mercedes‚Äô front wing at the Russian GP in 2019, Vettel has long been famed for investigating other cars.But Verstappen‚Äôs ‚Ç¨50,000 fine for touching Hamilton‚Äôs wing¬†prompted the FIA to say it would be strictly policing such moves in future, spelling the end for everyone‚Äôs favourite meme.Vettel himself even joked about it over his radio, telling his Aston Martin engineers that he was ‚Äúgoing to touch Hamilton's rear wing‚Äù after the sprint race, to which they responded: ‚ÄúDon't you dare! Very expensive‚Äù.Ever the joker, the four-time world champion replied: ‚ÄúI'm joking! I'll try the front wing, maybe it's ‚Ç¨25,000‚Ä¶‚ÄùWith Yuki Tsunoda enduring a tough learning curve in his rookie F1 campaign, it has been left to Pierre Gasly to lead the AlphaTauri charge against Alpine for fifth place in the constructors‚Äô standings.For the second race in a row, both teams leave the circuit on equal points - Alpine ahead on countback thanks to Esteban Ocon‚Äôs Hungarian GP win - but in truth it is Gasly‚Äôs one-man siege which has the upper hand with three races to go.The AlphaTauri package has been able to challenge even the likes of Ferrari and McLaren in recent races, Gasly once again proving that fact by qualifying as ‚Äòbest of the rest‚Äô behind the Mercedes and Red Bull drivers at Interlagos.PRIME: While the sprint didn‚Äôt quite follow suit, with Gasly dropping to eighth on the road which became seventh on the grid for the grand prix following Hamilton‚Äôs grid penalty, the Frenchman held his own by finishing seventh to match the points haul of the two Alpines.Gasly was particularly impressive fighting tag-team duo Fernando Alonso and Ocon, with both Alpines opting for an aggressive one-stop strategy to gain track position on the AlphaTauri driver, before slipstreaming each other with DRS in an attempt to keep Gasly at bay.But the 2020 Italian GP winner assessed the situation, adjusted his attacking lines and made light work of passing both Alpines on consecutive laps.As Yuki Tsunoda continues to trip over himself or his rivals, his latest faux pas coming in contacting Lance Stroll, AlphaTauri will be desperate for Gasly to maintain his current form over the final three races to finish off a stunning one-versus-two win.It‚Äôs often hard to feel sympathetic to Nikita Mazepin. The son of a Russian billionaire, he's a Formula 1 driver with an indifferent record on the track and an even worse reputation away from it.Plenty of regret and repentance came from Mazepin amid the fallout from a video, posted to his own social media account, of him grabbing a friends' breast. It made him F1‚Äôs new villain before even making his race debut, and crashing at the third corner of his Bahrain bow hardly helped matters.Since then the 22-year-old has made progress, albeit in a woefully underdeveloped and hard to handle Haas VF-21, but has continually been at war with team-mate Mick Schumacher while also becoming a nuisance by simply getting in the way of his rivals.The pressures of his rookie year in the F1 spotlight, exacerbated by a recent Mexican nightclub incident, finally told at the Brazilian GP as his usually steely outward appearance cracked. Mazepin was visibly emotional in front of the media after another tough qualifying in last place, the revealing moment showing him first and foremost as a human being.It is true that Mazepin has been given a much harsher treatment by fans and onlookers compared to his fellow rookies Schumacher and Tsunoda, who have also made their fair share of mistakes this season. But, while most of it is justified, it doesn‚Äôt detract from the fact Mazepin is still trying his best and finding his way in the brutal life of an F1 driver. He isn‚Äôt the first nor will he be the last to experience it, but it might act as a turning point for him.It‚Äôs been a long few weeks in F1. Beginning in Mexico, before travelling to Brazil and heading onto Qatar, teams will have covered over 12,000 miles by the end of next weekend's inaugural race in the Gulf state neighbouring Bahrain.Drivers themselves have criticised the gruelling schedule, with Gasly describing it as ‚Äúbrutal,‚Äù while Alonso said it was ‚Äúon the limit‚Äù for teams. They of course will have kind flights in first class and the best hotels possible, a luxury not afforded to many of their colleagues who burn the midnight oil to get the team from race to race.Freight delays ahead of the Sao Paulo Grand Prix didn‚Äôt help matters, with the late arrival of cars forcing teams to work into the night to ensure they were prepared in time for Friday's FP1 session. And it doesn‚Äôt look set to get any easier next year, with a record 23-race calendar planned.The future of Aston Martin team principal Otmar Szafnauer remains a hot topic as news of shock switch to Alpine broke over the weekend.Szafnauer attempted to brush off the story first on social media before then facing a barrage of questions from the media, but he came across like an awkward politician not willing to directly answer a question.While he tried to deflect questions, his strongest reply was ""I've been at the team for 12 years, I have no intention of leaving.‚ÄùWhen directly asked to rule out a move to Alpine in the future, his reply was telling: ""I learned a long, long time ago that predicting the future is an impossibility. And if I could do that, I would be in Vegas now.""The old saying ‚Äòthere is no smoke without fire‚Äô appears to apply here. Time will tell if he indeed makes the switch from green to blue, as Alpine looks to restructure for 2022.",https://cdn-1.motorsport.com/images/amp/Y99AGBxY/s1000/max-verstappen-red-bull-racing.jpg
