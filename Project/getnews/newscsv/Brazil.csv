"Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. ruled out for World Series - New York Post
HOUSTON —Lance McCullers Jr. won’t pitch for the Astros this series.Arguably Houston’s best pitcher was finally ruled out on Monday after he suffered a strained elbow during the ALDS. McCullers said it’s the type of injury that takes six to eight weeks to heal to the point he could pick up a ball.“We tried to push it as far as we could, but just couldn’t make it back to throwing,’’ McCullers said Monday at Minute Maid Park. “It’s disappointing. I’m just going to keep doing what I can do and have all the faith in our team and the guys that we have out there and try to win a World Series.Framber Valdez, who pitched eight innings in Game 5 of the ALDS against the Red Sox, will start for the Astros in Game 1 on Tuesday and Houston manager Dusty Baker said though the team had decided on a Game 2 starter, he wouldn’t announce it.McCullers had a 3.16 ERA in the regular season and pitched twice against the White Sox in the ALDS.The Astros enter the World Series with a better record than Atlanta, but no team was hotter than the Braves after the trade deadline. They’re 44-22 since they bolstered their team on July 30, remaking their outfield.Freddie Freeman called it “pretty amazing” the Braves were still playing given how their season went and the moves it made at the deadline. Marcell Ozuna is on administrative leave after being arrested on assault charges after allegedly assaulting his wife. Ronald Acuna Jr. had surgery to repair his ACL and the Braves were saved by the arrival of Joc Pederson, Eddie Rosario, Jorge Soler and Adam Duvall.“We’ve got a whole different team pretty much in the outfield,’’ Freeman said. “We were just trying to figure out how all this worked. … We were just trying to figure out how all these pieces fit on our team. Next thing you know, about a month in, the pieces started fitting, and we started rolling as a group. To have a whole new outfield that you did in April than you did at the end of July, it’s hard to do.”As Baker prepares to face the organization that drafted him in the World Series, he was asked about the effect Hank Aaron had on him.“I think about him all the time, especially in a series like this,’’ Baker said. “I feel his presence, especially him and my dad.”Baker made his MLB debut with Atlanta in 1968, when he was 19 and Aaron was a 34-year-old slugger. “He had a tremendous impact not only on the baseball field, but in my life and in my family and in business. I’ll be forever grateful to him, and he’s had probably a great impact also on [Atlanta manager Brian] Snitker over there because he hired him when Hank was a farm director to begin his managerial career. So Hank’s footprints are all over this series.”This is Baker’s second appearance managing in the World Series — and first since 2002, when he was with the Giants. San Francisco lost to the Angels in a series in which one of the most memorable moments was J.T. Snow grabbing Baker’s 3-year-old son, Darren, who was a bat boy for the Giants and was near home plate as Snow crossed the plate.“Time passes very quickly, and we are remembering that time,’’ Baker said of Darren, who is now 22 and was drafted by the Nationals in the 10th round of this year’s amateur draft. “Everybody remembers that except him. He’s the only one that doesn’t remember it. People remind him of it all the time. Sometimes he gets tired of talking about it, but it is part of my history, Giants history, baseball history, and his history. Now he’s trying to make his own history with the Nationals as a player, and I’m just glad that he was able to be here for this.”",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"Seahawks vs. Saints score: Alvin Kamara explodes for 179 total yards as New Orleans escapes Seattle with win - CBSSports.com
The New Orleans Saints moved to 4-2 on the season after defeating the Seattle Seahawks on the road 13-10. After Jameis Winston was able to lead the Saints' offense on a 42-yard drive that resulted in the go-ahead field goal late in the fourth quarter, Geno Smith and the Seahawks were unable to march down the field to -- at the very least -- force overtime. On that final drive of the game for Seattle, the Saints were able to sack Smith twice to truly ice the contest and pull away with the win. Out of the gate, it looked like Smith and the Seahawks were going to pull off the prime-time win as the veteran quarterback connected with receiver DK Metcalf for an 84-yard touchdown to begin the scoring for the evening. However, Seattle's offense went silent for the remainder of the first half while the Saints were able to claw into the lead. Just before these teams went into the locker room at halftime, the New Orleans was able to pull off a two-minute drill that traveled 85 yards don't the field and resulted in an Alvin Kamara touchdown reception to take a 10-7 lead. At that point, Seattle seemed to be on its heels. Alvin Kamara was the star of Monday night as the Saints star back had 30 touches for 179 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown. He primarily did his damage in the passing game, catching 10 of his 11 targets for 128 yards and that score. Winston finished 19 of 35 passing for 222 yards and a touchdown. On the other side, Smith completed 12 of his 22 throws for 167 yards and a touchdown. As a team, Seattle rushed 28 times for just 90 yards (3.2 yards per carry). Fore a more in-depth look at how this game unfolded, check out our takeaways below.Kamara carried the offense for the bulk of the night. Out of New Orleans' 68 total plays on offense, he touched the ball nearly 50% of the time (30 touches). The Pro Bowl back also accounted for 58.8% of the Saints' overall offensive production, finishing with 179 yards from scrimmage. That type of performance was needed as the New Orleans wide receiver unit couldn't really get into a consistent rhythm for much of the game. The fact that the Seahawks had no answer for Kamara helped Sean Payton's team earn an edge in time of possession, particularly early in the game. The Saints also were able to absorb Seattle's opening punch of the game in the form of a Metcalf 84-yard touchdown and bounced back well. On back-to-back drives just before halftime, New Orleans went on a 10-0 run to take the lead. Over that stretch, they held on to the ball for more than 12 minutes and travelled more than 80 yards on each of those two possessions. While Kamara was dominating out of the New Orleans backfield, the Saints' defense was smothering Seattle's running game throughout the evening. The Seahawks clearly wanted to run the offense through the ground game, but they couldn't get much of anything going, especially with starter Alex Collins, who the Saints limited to just 35 yards on 16 carries.  It seemed like Pete Carroll didn't want to put the game in Smith's hands. The veteran quarterback gave early flashes that he could possibly pull out the win with his arm with that touchdown bomb to Metcalf, but the Seahawks continued to force-feed the running game to a maddening degree. After that touchdown to Metcalf, the star receiver went 38 offensive snaps before receiving another target, which came at the 11:51 mark in the fourth quarter. Getting the ball in his hands along with Tyler Lockett (two catches on three targets) should have been a much bigger priority, especially as the backfield kept running into a wall. While Smith maybe should have been given a longer leash in the passing game, he also didn't do his team many favors in this game either. There were a handful of times where Seattle was needlessly forced to burn timeouts as the play clock was ticking down to zero. That was due to Smith trying to adjust at the line of scrimmage and not noticing how much time was left to get the play off. Not having those timeouts did prove costly in their hopes of possibly moving down the field late to tie or take the lead in the fourth quarter. Issues in the kicking game also put Seattle behind the eight ball as Jason Meyers missed two field goals in the loss, both coming in the second half.  At around the six-minute mark of the fourth quarter, it looked as if the Seahawks were going to force the Saints into a three-and-out as linebacker Bobby Wagner was wrapping up Winston for a 5-yard sack. However, Marquise Blair committed a clear roughing the passer penalty that not only negated the sack but gave New Orleans a new set of downs. It also completely flipped the field as they were now into Seattle territory at the 41-yard line. Penalties really plagued Seattle on that drive as they were also called for an encroachment penalty on a fourth-and-5 play later on in the possession where Seattle was liming up for a field goal. While they would eventually settle for a field goal, that penalty chewed off another minute of time on the clock and burned the two-minute warning. That drive ultimately resulted in the game-winning kick by undrafted rookie Brian Johnson..@GenoSmith3 ➡️ @dkm14 and that's a touchdown for EIGHTY FOUR YARDS! 🙌📺: #NOvsSEA on ESPN You won't find a a more dramatic play from this game than Metcalf's 84-yard touchdown to open up the scoring. Smith saw that the safety was playing the middle of the field, which meant Metcalf had a one-on-one with Marshon Lattimore. He was able to get a step on the Saints corner as he made a play on the ball, secured the catch and galloped the rest of the way for a touchdown. Unfortunately for Seattle, that was essentially all we saw from Metcalf for the rest of the game as he finished with just one other catch that came in the fourth quarter. From here, the Saints will head back to New Orleans and await the division-leading Buccaneers for their first of two matchups this season. Tampa Bay will be coming into that game winners of four straight, including a 38-3 rout vs. the Bears on Sunday. As for the Seahawks, they'll be sticking around Seattle in Week 8 when they play host to the Jacksonville Jaguars, who are fresh off a Week 7 bye.Demario Davis is now speaking with the media https://t.co/Ec7fMQCnsCNOLA ROAD DUBS ⚜️ https://t.co/mCZa4qoDyMBrian Johnson on his #Saints kicking debut (2-2 FGs, 1-1 PAT) Winston speaking with the media now https://t.co/Ec7fMQCnsCFinal stat leaders for the night ⤵️#NOvsSEA | @Sanderson_Corp Cam Jordan is speaking with the media https://t.co/Ec7fMQCnsCLeaving Seattle with the W 👍 Kamara is speaking with the media https://t.co/Ec7fMQCnsCListen in as Head Coach @PeteCarroll and select players speak with media after tonight's game.#GoHawks x #NOvsSEA https://t.co/4QsWBMxYeJPayton on the impact of @demario__davis QB RESPECT 🙌 #NOvsSEA Payton on the Monday night win Watch Live: Saints postgame show#NOvsSEA | @Verizon  https://t.co/SdEO7adIxx😔 Monday Night Dubs 🤑🤑https://t.co/T71T2dCSSxPRIMETIME DUB ✔️#NOvsSEA | @Gatorade Very impressive win dudes.  @SaintsYikes. Geno Smith hit DK Metcalf for that early 84-yard TD.Smith had 83 yards on his other 21 pass attempts.Metcalf had 12 yards on his other 4 targets.Lockett finished with 12 yards on 3 targets.Russell Wilson could still come back in a few weeks and salvage Seattle's season, but the Seahawks might be too far behind by the time he's ready.That'll do it, folks.

The position in which Matt Nagy put Justin Fields was worse. - Yahoo Sports
After  to Tampa Bay, Bears coach Matt Nagy discussed the challenges of a new quarterback playing in a big game.“Early on it's just important with a young, rookie quarterback … to get off to a fast start and get some confidence and some momentum going,” Nagy said.Sure. Good plays can beget good plays. Comfort creates production. In the same vein, just one mistake can rattle a rookie into a dreadful performance, such as Justin Fields’ three-interception, two-fumble debacle on Sunday.Except Nagy said what he said without a hint of self-awareness. He spent most of his postgame media conference painting he and his coaching staff – “teachers” he even dubbed them at one point – as helpless prisoners of Fields’ inexperience.“It’s making sure his eyes go where our eyes are going … we’re trying to make him comfortable and feel good with what we do schematically … we have to continue to stay patient …”Yet Nagy did little to acknowledge the coaching error that led to Fields’ first interception, the one that all but eliminated any kind of “fast start” or “confidence” or “momentum.”That one came on third-and-5, midway through the first quarter. That’s when Fields was told through his headset that Tampa had 12 defenders on the field. Fields immediately called for the snap, hoping to catch Tampa Bay in a penalty that would allow him a risk-free shot down the field.“We have a free play,” Fields said he thought. “So I was trying to snap the ball quick. Me snapping the ball quick, I think it caught our receivers off-guard.”The play was a mess, with protection quickly breaking down. That caused Fields to stumble and then scramble. Still believing the Bears had 5 yards and a first down in the bag, he gambled and threw deep only to have his receiver fall down. The ball wound up intercepted by the Bucs' Dee Delaney.Whatever. First-and-10, right?No. It turns out Tampa didn’t have 12 defenders on the field. Either the voice over the headset had it wrong originally or failed to estimate how quickly the extra player would reach the sideline. There was no flag. The play stood. Tampa’s ball. Six snaps later, Tom Brady threw a touchdown to take a 14-0 lead. The game was essentially over.“In the headset, they were telling me we had 12 men on the field,” Fields explained. “... it just went bad from there.”Boy did it ever. Although at least some, if not most, of that had to do with an offensive line that is incapable of protecting Fields.You’d think Nagy would shoulder much or all of the blame, if he wanted to try to keep Fields’ confidence up and move on from what was always a likely loss at the reigning Super Bowl champions. If not, he could at least point out the coaches screwed the kid on the first pick that set the tone for the day.That didn’t happen though, which leads to wonder about how this development works for a raw prospect being led by a hot-seat coach? The 12-men interception was, according to Nagy, apparently Fields’ fault, not the coaches.“As these young quarterbacks go through this development, there’s situations like this that can happen,” Nagy said. “We have techniques within our system to take advantage.“And when that happens, if they do have 12 guys on and you catch them obviously it’s a free play. If they don’t, and you hear that, that’s where you have to understand that and learn from that. And that’s our job that we are teaching that the right way. Not just him, but everybody.”So Fields was expected to hear that there were 12 players, yet have the wherewithal to instantly count that there were actually 11 and change accordingly?That’d be great if he could do that. But he can’t. Not yet, at least. After all, just last week the same problem happened. Very few rookies have that awareness. That’s an Aaron Rodgers play.Yet Nagy shrugged and shifted too much of the blame for the blowout on Fields.“The one thing you can’t do is give a short field to a great quarterback like that, and a great offense that’s well-coached,” Nagy said. “And you can’t lose, that drastically, the turnover battle.”Gee, wonder who had five turnovers? How is this productive – other than to paint a sympathetic picture of the coach?Fields, for his part, acknowledges his struggles. He has thrown two touchdowns against six interceptions. He has been . He’s still trying to find a rhythm out there.It might help if Chicago called some designed runs, which it hasn't in either of the past two games. Or at least stop barking about too many defenders on the field, which even if it were accurate is complicating the already complicated.All Fields can do is vow to work harder until Chicago (3-4) is winning again.“I’ve never been in this position where I'm losing,” Fields said. “I don’t know how to feel. My only reaction to this is to keep working. … You can get depressed or you can get up the next day and keep working.”He deserves better, though.“I'm going to keep working,” Fields said. “I’m going to keep going.”At least someone is saying the right things in Chicago.",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png
"Mark Zuckerberg Let False Anti-Abortion Video Back On Facebook To Mollify GOP: Report - HuffPost
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg intervened to reinstate a false anti-abortion video to assuage conservative Republican politicians, according to internal company documents Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen provided to Congress that .The incident was reportedly one of several instances of Facebook senior executives countermanding company policy to allow American politicians and celebrities to post whatever they wanted despite pleas from employees to moderate the content, according to the documents.Facebook particularly made exceptions for right-wing misinformation in the wake of relentless criticism from people such as former President Donald Trump that Facebook is biased against conservative views, the documents indicate.In one such instance, Zuckerberg was “personally involved” in a 2019 decision to reinstate an anti-abortion video that a moderator had removed from Facebook because of notable — and potentially dangerous — misinformation, according to the documents.Zuckerberg intervened after Republican politicians including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley wrote to accuse Facebook of censorship regarding the video, the Financial Times and Business Insider reported.The video falsely insisted that abortion is “never medically necessary,” the Financial Times recounted. There are multiple situations in which abortions are medically necessary to save the life or health of someone who is pregnant. In fact, Ireland eased its abortion laws in 2018 following outrage over one such case: the fatal septic miscarriage of 31-year-old Savita Halappanavar after doctors refused to perform an abortion on her because of legal constraints. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as Physicians for Reproductive Health, issued a statement in response to the anti-abortion video saying that “.”Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Zuckerberg’s role in reinstating the anti-abortion video.Haugen, a former Facebook employee who , has provided copies of thousands of pages of internal Facebook documents that supported her testimony against Facebook earlier this month before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection.Haugen and many of the so-called “Facebook Papers” have revealed that company executives are . They also know that polarization results in more customer engagement that increases company profits at the expense of social safety, Haugen testified.Zuckerberg has disputed that characterization of the company.In testimony Monday before a U.K. Parliament committee, Haugen said Facebook  and called for an overhaul of the company.She advocated for greater transparency and said that an outside regulator should insist that Facebook provide solutions to a litany of harms.“Instead of investing in 10,000 engineers to make the metaverse, invest in 10,000 engineers to make our world safer,” she urged.

Amid reports that Facebook has misled shareholders about significant declines in teens and younger users, Mark Zuckerberg said the company was “retooling” in order to make “serving young adults” its top priority. To do that, the company plans to make “significant changes” to its Facebook and Instagram apps, and spend billions of dollars building out its vision for a “metaverse.”Citing increased competition from TikTok and iMessage, Zuckerberg said the company would do more to win over “young adult” users between the ages of 18 to 29, even if it came at the expense of older users. Speaking during the company's third-quarter earnings call, he said the company’s TikTok rival Reels would be “as important for our products as Stories.” “We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in the next year to further lean into video and make Reels a more central part of the experience,” Zuckerberg said.On top of that, he said the company was “retooling” internally in order to make young people its “North Star.” He added the shift “will take years, not months.” The issue of younger users has been particularly fraught for the company. A whistleblower’s disclosures about Facebook’s internal research on teen mental health prompted a series of Congressional hearings about child safety, and a wave of headlines about how the photo sharing app may be harmful to some of its most vulnerable users. At the same time, other internal documents have indicated Facebook and Instagram have faced significant declines in engagement among teens and young adults for years.Zuckerberg said another major priority for the company would be building its vision for a “metaverse.” He didn’t comment on reports that the company would change its name to reflect its new focus on augmented reality and virtual reality, but made clear the company has significant ambitions in the space. “Our goal is to help the metaverse reach a billion people,” he said. He added that a metaverse could enable “hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.”The company also said Monday that going forward it will report two sets of financials: one for its “family” of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp; and one for its Reality Labs division that oversees its augmented and virtual reality work. In a statement, Facebook said its 2021 profit will be reduced by $10 billion due to its investment in Reality Labs, and that the company would only increase its AR and VR spending in the next “several years.”Zuckerberg also addressed the ongoing revelations stemming from the ""Facebook Papers,"" a series of articles based on documents provided by former employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen. The CEO referred to the work from a consortium of news organizations as ""a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company."" The documents, which have been the basis of more than a dozen stories detailing Facebook's botched efforts to fight hate speech and other harms, have also been provided to members of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Any honest account should be clear that these issues aren't primarily about social media,"" Zuckerberg said.

But other Seattle businesses say they have already lost customers because of the vaccination requirement, and the owners don’t want another regulation that they claim hurts small businesses, especially at a time when they’re already struggling from .Leonard Garfield, executive director of Seattle’s Museum of History & Industry, has been looking forward to the vaccination requirement and the effect it will have on the museum’s visitors. “We think the net effect will be that our visitors and our community will feel safer knowing that everyone around them in that venue is fully vaccinated and ready to enjoy life knowing that they’re healthy and safe,” he said.Other museums, including the Burke Museum and the Wing Luke Museum, which won’t open until later this week, are also expecting everything to go smoothly for patrons. Jeff Brein, who owns the Seattle-area movie theater group Far Away Entertainment, is also optimistic — but cautiously so — about the new regulation’s effects on his two Seattle movie theaters: Varsity Theatre in the University District and the Historic Admiral Theater in the North Admiral neighborhood. He said Far Away Entertainment has been getting emails for the past four or five months from customers saying they won’t go back to movie theaters unless there is a vaccine policy. He’s hopeful that with the proof of vaccine requirement, movie theaters may see an increase in patrons. If that’s the case, Far Away Entertainment may consider introducing the mandate at theaters in other counties, or doing vaccine-only showtimes. Some business owners, though, are already seeing negative consequences from the requirement.Transform 180, a gym focused on personal training with locations in Belltown and South Lake Union, lost 15% of its members in the days leading up to when the vaccine or test requirement started, according to its owner, Charith Madawela. He said his revenue hasn’t recovered to anywhere near pre-pandemic levels, and the loss in members is a big hit. Many of his former clients are still not coming to work out even if they are vaccinated because they don’t want to train in a mask, he said.Justin Young, who owns Flow Fitness’s two Seattle locations, said he thinks it’s unfair that the government continues to roll out new pandemic restrictions that hurt small businesses without helping them handle the costs. Meanwhile, John Carrico, who owns NW Fitness Gym in downtown Seattle with Jess, his wife, said they’ve also lost several gym members and an employee who didn’t want to get vaccinated because of the requirement. He said around 250 out of 450 gym members already sent in their vaccine cards, but he’s frustrated by the amount of work it will be to track down the other 200 who might have missed his emails or aren’t willing to get vaccinated. “We, unfortunately, have grown accustomed to having to adapt to some form of regulation almost every three months for the last two years,” Carrico said. “It just piles on the work for our already-taxed team.” But he said they may get some new members who are now comfortable working out because of the vaccine requirement, which might help make up for the loss of members they’ve seen so far. For Michelle Cozzaglio, co-owner and curator of the Oddities & Curiosities Expo coming to the Washington State Convention Center on Oct. 30, the new regulation has become a major hurdle — particularly the requirement that non-vaccinated attendees show a negative coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of the event.Cozzaglio, who is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has been hearing from customers who bought their tickets weeks and months ago, who say testing delays might make them miss the event. “I’ve had to refund people, and we typically have no refunds,” she said. On top of that, the expo — which brings together vendors of dark art, taxidermy and other cabinet-of-curiosity-type goods — has had to hire a staffing service to make sure all attendees comply with the new regulation.Some Seattle restaurant owners see the requirement as another barrier to profitability in an industry that’s been struck particularly hard by past pandemic regulations and the labor shortage. They’re also concerned the requirement will put added pressure on staff. “Many restaurants have struggled to hire workers during the pandemic, and adding staff for the front door to check vaccine status has created an added challenge,” said Steve Hooper, president of Seattle’s Ethan Stowell Restaurants group. Stowell said in August he’s had to .Bart Evans, the owner of Bluwater Bistro in Seattle’s Leschi neighborhood, is so supportive of vaccinations that , but even he has mixed feelings about the requirement for customers because he’s worried about how to enforce it. “Our staff is fully vaccinated,” Evans said. “It’s only fair that we expect our customers to be.” He’s worried, though, about putting his staff in a position where they have to bar people from the restaurant. His employees are used to welcoming people, not acting as bouncers.“It’s not a role we like to play or are used to,” Evans said. “We’re not a nightclub in Pioneer Square.”Seattle Times staff reporters Brendan Kiley and Crystal Paul contributed to this story.

"Dave Chappelle responds to Netflix comedy special backlash - NPR
Comedian Dave Chappelle has faced scrutiny for his recent Netflix comedy special The Closer — after his comments about the trans community sparked controversy. In a recent Instagram video posted Monday, Chappelle addresses the controversial Netflix special in a five-minute clip. Below is a transcript of the video posted online:""It's been said in the press that I was invited to speak to the transgender employees of Netflix and I refused. That is not true — if they had invited me I would have accepted it, although I am confused about what we would be speaking about. I said what I said, and boy, I heard what you said. My God, how could I not? You said you want a safe working environment at Netflix. It seems like I'm the only one who can't go to the office.""""I want everyone in this audience to know that even though the media frames it that it's me versus that community, that's not what it is. Do not blame the LGBTQ community for any of this. It's about corporate interests, and what I can say, and what I cannot say. For the record, and I need you to know this, everyone I know from that community has been loving and supportive, so I don't know what this nonsense is about.""""This film that I made was invited to every film festival in the United States. Some of those invitations I accepted. When this controversy came out about 'The Closer', they began disinviting me from these film festivals. And now, today, not a film company, not a movie studio, not a film festival, nobody will touch this film. Thank God for Ted Sarandos and Netflix, he's the only one that didn't cancel me yet.""""To the transgender community, I am more than willing to give you an audience, but you will not summon me. I am not bending to anyone's demands. And if you want to meet with me, I am more than willing to, but I have some conditions. First of all, you cannot come if you have not watched my special from beginning to end. You must come to a place of my choosing at a time of my choosing, and thirdly, you must admit that Hannah Gadsby is not funny.""",https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2021/07/22/jonathan-franklin-headshot_sq-d53ebffee5769aeb2897fdfbbcd9252ce82c715e-s100-c85.jpg,"'The Voice' coach Blake Shelton's 'soul-crushing' decision: 'My heart's broken right now' - Yahoo Entertainment
As The Voice Season 21 Knockout Rounds commenced Monday, Team Blake hopeful Hailey Green — a shaved-headed, tattooed, 15-year-old badass who’s the ; who originally tried out for the show when she was just 13; and who was once compared to a “cheetah” — made an especially ballsy move by covering her own coach’s “God’s Country,” transforming it into a swampy rawker right in front of him.“Hailey is a bold artist, so it doesn't surprise me that she chose this song, because she doesn't hit me as a type of person to really back down from anything,” declared an amazed Blake Shelton. “I've literally lost years off my life trying to get through that vocal, and listening to you sing that — holy crap,” he raved, after Hailey fearlessly roared through the tune while playing fiery electric guitar. She “filled up this room with energy” according to John Legend, giving the track a Jon Bon Jovi/“Blaze of Glory” stadium vibe.But sadly, Hailey’s glory was short-lived. Unfortunately for her, her Knockouts competitor, Cameroonian chanteuse Libianca, spectacularly performed Billie Eilish's “Everything I Wanted.” And while Libianca, who has both depression and anxiety, struggled and even sobbed during rehearsal, she delivered a confident, jazzy performance that John described as a “master class” once she hit the main stage. You won't believe how powerful @HaileyGreen122 & @libianca3's performances are. ❤️ #VoiceKnockouts #TeamBlake — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021“There was no way in hell I was going to let Libianca leave. I feel like she had the tallest mountain to climb, and she was able to get it together. As a coach, there's no way I can't reward that,” Blake explained. Still, Blake confessed that letting Hailey go, especially after she sang his own song, absolutely crushed his soul. “My heart's broken right now,” he lamented.Yes, many tough decisions had to be made Monday, because at this stage in the game, there were no Saves left in play — only Steals. I was surprised that no other coach stole Hailey, who showed so much raw potential, but Hailey, who turned no chairs when she first tried out for The Voice last year, was simply grateful for another opportunity. “I was here in Season 19 and you told me to come back, and I just want to thank you for giving me that chance,” she graciously told Blake.These were other Knockout Rounds of Monday night — two of which did end in Steals:TEAM BLAKE: Jonathan Mouton vs. Wendy MotenGoing up against a veteran pro backup singer and four-chair frontrunner like Wendy, poor Jonathan — an original Team Legend member who was stolen by Blake in the Battle Rounds — must have known he was the underdog in this Mouton vs. Mouton showdown. His “I Can See Clearly Now” started off promisingly, with a masterful a cappella intro that showcased his pure tone, but the song choice was too light and laid-back, so his performance never really caught fire. Meanwhile, Wendy’s cover of Aretha Franklin’s “Ain’t No Way” was pure fire from the first verse, and she brought the heat throughout. “How do you honor an Aretha Franklin song, and yet breathe so much new life into it?” coach Ariana Grande marveled rhetorically.Ariana called Jonathan’s performance an “amazingly infectious interpretation,” and John said it was “full of heart and joy” and “so inviting.” But John called Wendy’s performance a “tour de force,” and Kelly Clarkson even told Wendy, “You're one of those vocalists that literally is the reason why I'm sitting here.” So, of course, Wendy prevailed. “Jonathan blew me away, but the only problem with that is Wendy blew the building away,” Blake explained. “There is too much talent this season, and it’s really overwhelming,” sighed Ariana, as she and her fellow coaches opted not to steal Jonathan and he exited the show.WINNER: Wendy MotenJonathan Mouton & @WendyMoten will give you instant chills. 🎤 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamBlake — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM ARIANA: Raquel Trinidad vs. Katie RaeIn this experience-vs.-youth pairing, 35-year-old mom Katie faced off against 23-year-old spitfire Raquel — with Katie doing a maudlin ballad, Lauren Daigle’s “Hold On to Me” (dedicated to her much-missed husband and 3-year-old son back home), and the bubbly, bouncy Raquel sassing it up during the Amy Winehouse version of the Zutons’ “Valerie.” Katie showcased the technically better voice — in fact, Ariana called it “one of the most powerful voices I've ever heard” — but her song choice felt old-fashioned and dreary, and her overall performance was staid. Meanwhile, Raquel, an American Idol alumnus and natural-born performer, was undeniably spunky and sparkling, lighting up the stage. Even Katie, sitting in her corner of the ring, couldn’t help but groove along.John said Katie had ""so much heart and connection with the song” and Kelly said Katie had “one of my favorite tones of the whole show,” but Ariana made the tough decision to keep Raquel, whom she called a “star.” But I guess Kelly really did love Katie’s tone, because she used her one Steal of the Knockouts on Katie, explaining, “I feel like I don't have anybody like her on my team. I've wanted Katie Rae since the Blinds, y'all, so I finally got her!” We will see if Katie can stand out more in Live Playoffs; song choice will be key.WINNER: Raquel Trinidad / STOLEN: Katie Rae moves to Team KellyKatie Rae & @groovyraq's performances are SO outstanding. 🔥 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamAriana — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM KELLY: Gymani vs. Kinsey RoseKelly self-deprecatingly admitted that she was an “idiot” to pair up such very different singers — a fiery soul stylist like Gymani and a sweet vintage-country crooner like Kinsey. Kinsey’s winsome cover of Deana Carter’s ‘90s hit “Strawberry Wine” was pleasant and pretty, but she was definitely disadvantaged following Gymani’s vocal-gymnastic workout of Zayn’s “Pillowtalk,” a passionate performance that had Mega Mentor Ed Sheeran comparing her to the almighty Jazmine Sullivan. “You ain’t never heard ‘Pillowtalk’ like this!” bragged Kelly, who ultimately picked the “better competitor” and saved Gymani. “What Gymani did with ‘Pillowtalk’ made me recognize she really came to win,” Kelly explained. I was surprised that Blake didn’t steal Kinsey, a four-chair contestant that vowed to “keep making country music” and probably would have won any other Knockout, but he said, “I didn't use my Steal for Kinsey, because I'm really trying to narrow down to one great country artist on my team this season.” WINNER: Gymani.@kellyclarkson has a tough decision to make between @IAmGymani & @KinseyRoseMusic. 😱 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamKelly — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM LEGEND: Sabrina Dias vs. Joshua VacantiJoshua’s cover of Harry Styles’s plaintive heartbreak ballad “Falling” was very dramatic — maybe too dramatic. I think he needed to practice more restraint to tap into the song's muted sadness and sense of defeat, but Joshua ramped up way too soon, pretty much 10 seconds into the first verse. That being said, it was a proper showcase for his elastic, operatic voice, and the coaches were wowed. Meanwhile, Sabrina held back too much during her cover of Ed Sheeran’s “Photograph” — a song she’d picked before she knew Ed would actually be this season's Mega Mentor, so maybe she was nervous. However, her drumming was super-cool and something we hadn’t seen since Vicci Martinez banged the drums in Season 1.All of the coaches were impressed by the fact that Sabrina brought out a drum kit and a guitar (a one-woman-band performance that was actually quite Sheeran-esque) while not letting all that multi-tasking compromise her vocals. But Kelly loved Joshua’s “big and round” tone, Blake said Joshua “came out and swung for the fence,” and John said Joshua “made the audience feel every single word that you sing.” I just wish Sabrina had done more drumming, rather than standing behind her kit like it was a stage prop for most of her song, because that would have helped her stand out more — and possibly survive. Perhaps she was just doomed by doing Ed’s song, just as Hailey was doomed by doing Blake’s.WINNER: Joshua Vacanti.@joshuavacanti singing @harry_styles & @sabrinadiasmusi singing @edsheeran? Yes, please! 👏 #VoiceKnockouts #TeamLegend — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021TEAM KELLY: Girl Named Tom vs. Holly ForbesBoth four-chair contestants, these two conjured magic tonight and lived up to their early promise. Holly, who had been frustratingly montaged during the Battles after getting a ton of screentime during the Blinds, was fully back and more brilliant than ever on the aptly titled “Superstar.” This was an exquisite vocal (Kelly called it “beautiful” and “edgy”) that even had Ariana saying, “Your voice is the kind that I grew up hearing and being like, ‘I want to sing!’” But sibling trio Girl Named Tom’s “Wichita Lineman,” dedicated to their terminally ill father, was also “flawless,” according to John, and Ariana said it was awards-ceremony-level.Kelly was probably thinking once again that she was an “idiot” for putting these two frontrunners together, but she ultimately reasoned, “Holly, she's got such a rad voice, but I had to pick Girl Named Tom because they sound amazing together, but then they showed how each of them sound alone, and they can hold their own. That was so hard!”Holly was too awesome to pass up, of course, so both John and Ariana went in for the Steal — reviving a rivalry from the Blind Auditions when Ariana had wanted to work with Holly so badly that she'd “maliciously held back” John by using her one Block of the season on him. Holly ended up picking Kelly at that time, but Ariana’s perseverance finally paid off this week. Sorry, John.WINNER: Girl Named Tom / STOLEN: Holly Forbes moves to Team Ariana.@hollyforbes & @GirlNamedTom's #VoiceKnockouts performances will have you saying ""WOW."" ✨ #TeamKelly — The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) October 26, 2021Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/photo/81478822.cms,"'Insecure' Season 5 Premiere: AKA Backlash, Amanda Seales, Issa Rae - TVLine

Social media can be stranger than fiction at times. This is what actress Amanda Seales learned after Sunday’s Insecure Season 5 premiere.Seales’ character Tiffany — who is an Alpha Kappa Alpha “soror,” or sister — wore several pink-and-green AKA-inspired outfits and the sorority’s shield in the college reunion-themed episode, as she’s done a number of times in the show’s five-year history. (.) But for whatever reason, this time around, her fashion caught the attention of women who are actually in the sorority, who then took to Twitter to angrily attack the show and its costar because she is not an AKA in real life. 








“I don’t know why people keep asking me if I’m a soror,” Seales said in an Instagram video in response to the AKA backlash. “I am not a soror. Tiffany is a soror. Tiffany is a character on a TV show. I didn’t write the character. I play the character. I’m an actress, and I’m playing a character on a TV show.”Seales then said in another video that she would’ve crossed the burning sands and pledged AKA if she’d had the time in graduate school at Columbia University, but she didn’t. Insecure‘s Molly, played by Yvonne Orji, is also an AKA but rarely wears as much pink-and-green insignia as Tiffany. Orji is also not a member of the sorority in real life.“I think reality TV done really got folks f–ked-up… I’m just playing a character,” Seales added. “I feel like some folks really forget like it’s a TV show.”In one tweet, a fan of the show demanded that co-creator and star Issa Rae and HBO not disrespect AKAs by allowing a non-member to play one. Ever the jokester, Rae responded, “Oh s–t, let me tell @HBO to delete one of the upcoming episodes then, hold on.”What do you think of Amanda Seales playing an AKA on Insecure?

Denis Villeneuve, Timothee Chalamet on “Dune” setJust how big is Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” adaptation? It forced the Oscar-nominated director to use more than one camera unit for the first time in his career. Villeneuve revealed as much in a conversation with Christopher Nolan for the DGA’s . The production requirements for “Dune” outweighed any of Villeneuve’s previous directorial efforts, including “Blade Runner 2049.” The only way Villeneuve could tackle a film of “Dune’s” size was to accept multiple camera units.“For the first time of my life, I decided to work with more than one unit because otherwise I would not be here…it was too much work to do in too little time,” Villeneuve told Nolan. “For the first time, I had to learn to direct multiple units and that’s not the best way to work. I love to work with one camera, one tripod. But I didn’t have a choice…I had to do it this way.” 








In an interview published last year by Collider, two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Roger Deakins and James Ellis, his wife, and close collaborator, revealed that the line producer on “Blade Runner 2049” expected Deakins and Villeneuve to use nine camera units to film “Blade Runner 2049.” They refused and stuck to their one-camera unit policy.

“We kept saying no, no, we don’t need that. And the line producer didn’t believe us,” James Ellis said. “The same thing with ‘Skyfall.’ They said, ‘Don’t you need five or six cameras?’ I know they didn’t believe we could do it with one camera.”“It’s always like that,” Roger Deakins added. “They say, we need a list of the four or five camera crews you want because we have to get all these shots. I said, what four or five? No! I thought that was strange to ask that on ‘Blade Runner’ as we worked with Denis before, quite successfully I felt. But it’s always like that with production. The bigger movies, if someone says, ‘Oh, we’ll put six cameras on it and get the scene.’ No thanks.”In that same interview, Deakins said it’s “sloppy” to make movies by relying on various camera units and he said he filmed “Blade Runner 2049” predominantly with one camera. A time Deakins made an exception to his second unit rule was during the production of “Skyfall.” A second unit camera team traveled to Turkey without Deakins to shoot footage, but Deakins only allowed it because he was able to heavily storyboard the shots he wanted along with director Sam Mendes. As Deakins said, “It wasn’t just a second unit going out and doing their own thing.”“Dune” is now playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max.This Article is related to: Film and tagged Blade Runner 2049, Denis Villeneuve, Dune",https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/themes/indiewire/images/indiewire-color.png
"SpaceX is 'go' to launch astronauts to space station on Halloween - Space.com
SpaceX is ""go"" to launch its spooky space station mission this weekend — as long as a toilet issue gets cleared up in time.No showstoppers were found during a flight readiness review (FRR) for the company's Crew-3 mission, which will send four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule. Crew-3 therefore remains on track to lift off early on Halloween morning (Oct. 31), NASA and SpaceX announced Monday (Oct. 25).""We had a good review today,"" Joel Montalbano, NASA's ISS program manager, said during a news conference Monday evening after the FRR wrapped up. The review revealed no surprises, Montalbano said. But that doesn't mean the NASA and SpaceX teams aren't working on any issues. Indeed, they need to resolve one outstanding item before Crew-3 can lift off — a slight redesign of .That tweak was prompted by an issue experienced on SpaceX's Inspiration4 mission, which sent four private citizens on a three-day trip to orbit last month. After that capsule, named Resilience, returned home, inspections revealed that a tube hooked up to a toilet storage tank had popped loose during flight. This ""allowed urine to not go into the storage tank but, essentially, to go into the fan system,"" Bill Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during Monday's news conference. But the leak didn't markedly affect Inspiration4, he added.""We didn't really even notice it; the crew didn't notice it until we got back"" to Earth, Gerstenmaier said.Still, SpaceX decided to revamp the toilet system on the Crew-3 capsule, known as Endurance, going with an all-welded structure to eliminate tube pop-offs, Gerstenmaier said. NASA needs to give the redesign a final thumbs-up before Crew-3 can fly, but that is expected to happen in the coming days.The toilet issue could potentially apply to another Crew Dragon: the capsule known as Endeavour, which flew SpaceX's Crew-2 mission and is still docked to the ISS. Endeavour is scheduled to come back to Earth with the four Crew-2 astronauts soon — on Nov. 4, if Crew-3 launches on time.Astronauts on the orbiting lab have examined Endeavour, looking for signs of corrosion caused by leaked urine (or rather, by an additive that SpaceX puts into the Crew Dragon septic system to remove ammonia from urine). They haven't found anything troublesome, and analyses by teams here on Earth indicate that all should be well for Crew-2's return, Gerstenmaier said.He also noted that leakage on Crew-2 was likely significantly lower than on Inspiration4, given that crewmembers used Endeavour's toilet only during its 24-hour trip to the space station rather than for three full days.—

While there is still work to be done to get to launch, with continued integrated tests and Wet Dress Rehearsal, seeing the fully stacked SLS is certainly a reward for all of us.” Testing includes interface verification testing, program-specific engineering testing, end-to-end communications testing, countdown sequencing testing and wet dress rehearsal testing.According to Space.com, in a Friday media briefing, deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development at NASA Headquarters Tom Whitmeyer told reporters that the stacked rocket and crew capsule will roll out to the Launch Pad 398 in late December for testing and west dress rehearsal testing in January before going back for more checkouts followed by another move onto the pad.“Prior to rolling out to the pad for wet dress, teams will conduct the first of a two-part test of the flight termination system inside the VAB.

The official QZSS website : QZS-1, QZS-2, QZS-3 and QZS-4.Related: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries confirmed roughly 28 minutes after liftoff that the QZS-R1 satellite had successfully separated from the rocket's upper stage The QZSS constellation will eventually consist of a total of seven satellites that fly in an orbit passing through a near-zenith (or directly overhead) above Japan, and QZS-R1 is meant to share nearly the same transmission signals as recent GPS satellites, according to JAXA. It is specially optimized for mountainous and urban regions in Japan, JAXA said.Mitsubishi Industries launched the satellite on an H-2A 202 rocket. The launch system has been operational since 2003 and has sent satellites to locations such as Venus (Akatsuki) and Mars (Emirates Mars Mission). This was the first launch of the H2-A since Nov. 29, 2020, when Japan launched an advanced relay satellite with laser communications tech into orbit.Follow Elizabeth Howell on Twitter @howellspace.

"The $1,800 Sony Xperia Pro-I phone has a one-inch camera sensor and a dual-aperture - CNET
For years, many of us have hoped for a phone with a truly amazing camera built around a large image sensor. In 2018, cinema camera maker  which ended up having a mid-tier Android camera system that could shoot 3D photos and videos. Now don't get me wrong, what Apple, Google, Huawei and Samsung have been able to do with tiny image sensors and computational photography is absolutely amazing. But you have to wonder: What if the iPhone, instead of having an image sensor that was 0.6 inches, had one that was one-inch? And that's where Sony enters the conversation with the Xperia Pro-I. It's basically a Sony Xperia 1 III phone with the sensor from a Sony RX100 VII camera.The middle camera with the large lens opening has a one-inch image sensor.What's amazing is that Sony was able to fit a one-inch sensor into a phone body that is roughly the same thickness as an iPhone 13 Pro Max. A larger sensor means a wider dynamic range and improved low-light performance for both photos and videos. But it turns out, that one-inch image sensor might not be fully used. The  that just 60% of the Xperia Pro-I's one-inch sensor is used for photos and videos. That means instead of taking 20-megapixel photos like the Sony RX100 VII, the Xperia Pro-I takes 12-megapixel photos. That's not necessarily a dealbreaker, but it's a definite bummer.Sony sent me a pre-production sample of the Xperia Pro-I to try. Photos and videos look good. Check out the hands-on video attached to this article to see video clips I shot using the Xperia Pro-I. I still have more testing and will do a full in-depth review once I can get a final production sample. All photos and videos I shot were taken with the main camera and its 24-millimeter lens or the ultrawide camera with its 16-millimeter lens. The 50-millimeter camera was disabled on the pre-production prototype.I like the way the Xperia Pro-I handles highlights and shadows in this photo of a trio of good doggies.The Xperia Pro-I doesn't apply too much sharpening.This isn't a great way to take a photo, but I wanted to test the Xperia Pro-I against some harsh backlighting and it did a decent job of protecting the details and highlights in skin tones.The dynamic range is good.Like other Xperia phones, the Pro-I doesn't have a dedicated night mode.Sony is not the only company to put a one-inch sensor into a phone. But the sensor in the Xperia Pro-I has been through seven generations of improvements and updates and combines the finesse of Sony's other phone photographic tools and apps.Like the Xperia 1 III, the Xperia Pro-I has Sony's Photo Pro and Cinema Pro apps. But, Sony wanted a better video option for those looking for something more advanced than basic video recording and something not as complicated as using the Cinema Pro app. With the Xperia Pro-I, Sony is launching a new app called Video Pro which is aimed at journalists, vloggers and the like.The top of the app has an Auto button that lets the phone make all the choices about shutter speed, ISO and white balance. But when you turn that off, you can manually control everything. You can switch between manual focus and autofocus and there is a slider which lets you zoom in and out while recording. You can switch the aperture from f/2 to f/4. You can reprogram the hardware buttons on the phone to trigger a shortcut in Video Pro like using the volume rocker to zoom-in and out.I couldn't get my hands on the new Sony vlogging monitor kit or a photo of it. So I recreated my own using a Post-It Note as the tiny magnetic monitor and a chain of paperclips as the cable that connects the monitor to the phone.The Xperia Pro-I works with . That's important because along with the Xperia Pro-I, Sony announced a $199 vlogging monitor kit which comes with a phone mount, a magnetic monitor and a tiny cable to connect the monitor and phone. The kit makes it so that you can film yourself with main rear camera and that one-inch sensor.The Xperia Pro-I has the same 4K 120Hz display, USB-C port and dedicated headphone jack as the Xperia 1 III. The Xperia Pro-I runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 5G processor and supports low and mid-band 5G. Sony still plans to sell the . The differentiator is it has a micro-HDMI port, 5G support for both sub-6 and mmWave here in the US.You can order the Sony Xperia Pro-I starting Oct. 28 and the phone ships Dec. 10. ",https://www.cnet.com/a/img/CD--n5H3ZX45pWRbbE01vjqa1VI=/84x84/2016/10/19/ccb7114f-6b74-49e4-845b-ebf6fee03eaa/patrickholland.jpg,"Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) Review: A Much-Needed Redesign - HYPEBEAST
Apple announced a long-awaited update to the AirPods at its Unleashed event earlier this month.The AirPods (3rd generation) — Apple’s first major redesign of its popular flagship wireless earbuds — introduces an entirely new look while also adding in great features like spatial audio and Adaptive EQ borrowed from the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, alongside longer battery life.Most striking is the new design of the AirPods, which offers a shorter stem and a larger earpiece that is less prone to slipping out of your ears during an intense running session (a longstanding gripe of AirPods users). The more snug fit also means the audio quality is less disturbed by the outside environment, making sounds more crisp and direct. To create the new contoured shape, Apple took thousands of ear scans and measurements, in-depth studies of acoustics and heat mapped modeling to create a lightweight and intentional earpiece that is optimized for comfort. The stem also features a force sensor — a feature of the AirPods Pro that users find intuitive — that allows for easier maneuvering between songs right from the buds. And the AirPods and its case now also have a greater sweat and water resistance rating of IPX4, just like the AirPods Pro.













Major enhancements have also been made to the audio quality — a feature that is crucial for a great pair of headphones. Apple has introduced a custom driver and high dynamic range amplifier to create richer bass and smooth high frequencies. The voice quality has been improved to optimize voice clarity during phone calls, with an inset microphone embedded in each earbud that is covered in a special acoustic mesh to reduce wind noise. In addition, they also feature AAC-ELD, a superior codec that allows for full-HD voice quality.
Fan-favorite spatial audio with dynamic head tracking has been added to the new AirPods, which uses advanced spatial audio algorithms to provide theatre-like sound. The result is rich and layered audio that sounds like it’s coming from all around you, definitely an upgrade most noticeable when watching movies, listening to music or when speaking on a group chat. The device utilizes a powerful H1 chip and employs Adaptive EQ to customize the listening experience for each user, while an inward-facing microphone has been added to each bud to listen to the sound emerging from the device and automatically tune the low-and-mid frequencies to the user’s ear shape in real-time.
In addition, Apple has expanded the device’s battery life with up to 6 hours of listening from a single charge — an hour upgrade from the previous generation — and has introduced MagSafe charging for the case for even more charging options.













And like the previous models, AirPods include delightful features like one-tap setup, in-ear detection using an all-new skin detect optical sensor, beamforming microphones, audio sharing, Siri and Find My built right into the device.
The AirPods (3rd generation) will be available for $179 USD in-store and online beginning Tuesday, October 26. The price of the AirPods (2nd generation) has also dropped to $129 USD while the AirPods Pro now comes with the MagSafe charging case for the same price of $249 USD.
Overall, it appears that Apple carefully crafted the new iteration of AirPods by utilizing some of the best features available in the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max while also giving the buds new hardware and a complete redesign. The result is both a great standalone product as well as a great addition to the full AirPods family lineup.

Yesterday@filipeespositoApple has finally released macOS Monterey to the public. The update comes with several new features, including Focus mode for notifications, SharePlay, Live Text, and more. Another new feature is the ability to AirPlay from an iPhone or iPad to a Mac without having to install any third-party apps, so read on as we detail how to use this feature.
AirPlay is a wireless protocol from Apple created to stream audio and video from one device to another, such as Apple TV or HomePod. Now with macOS Monterey, users can easily turn their Macs into AirPlay servers. In other words, you can play a song or even share your iPhone or iPad screen and stream it on your Mac.First of all, if you want to use AirPlay to Mac, you’ll need to have a compatible Mac. Not every Mac that can run macOS Monterey supports the new feature, so check the list below to see if your Mac can be used as an AirPlay server:AirPlay was officially introduced with iOS 4 years ago. However, only the devices listed below can transmit content in higher qualities and resolutions:In theory, once you have installed macOS Monterey on a supported Mac, there’s not much you need to AirPlay from an iOS device to your computer.On your iPhone or iPad, look for the AirPlay button in the Control Center or within supported apps. If you want to share the screen of your device over AirPlay, tap the Screen Mirroring toggle in the Control Center. Then select your Mac from the AirPlay list. The content should be wirelessly streamed to your computer after a few seconds.If for some reason AirPlay to Mac is not working or if you want to disable the feature, Apple provides an option to do this in the macOS settings. First, open the System Preferences app and then click on the Sharing option.Look for AirPlay Receiver in the service list. There, you can uncheck the box to disable AirPlay to Mac. There are also settings to restrict AirPlay only to other devices registered to your Apple ID or anyone on the same network. A password can also be set to enable AirPlay to Mac.It’s worth mentioning that AirPlay to Mac also works by wire using a USB cable. Apple says that using a cable is recommended for when you need low latency or if you don’t have access to a Wi-Fi network. For those who have AirPlay 2 compatible speakers, the Mac can also be used as another AirPlay 2 speaker to play songs or podcasts simultaneously with the multiroom audio option.",https://9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/10/AirPlay-iPhone-iPad-to-Mac.png,"Google Camera adds a color temperature slider on Pixel 6 series [Gallery] - 9to5Google
Yesterday@NexusBenThe revamped camera hardware on the Pixel 6 series delivers better overall shots that are stunning on their own and seem to  in big ways, but it doesn’t come down just to hardware. Alongside new motion features, the Pixel 6 also adds a color temperature slider to the Google Camera app.
Available on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, this new color temperature slider in the Google Camera app works alongside the contrast and brightness sliders on the other side of the interface. The slider, as you might expect, adjusts the color temperature of the scene to make it warmer or cooler to suit the shot you need.The effect can be rather dramatic at its highest levels, but it can help in adjusting the temperature in scenes that need it. As mentioned in our review, this is a feature I didn’t find necessary over the time I’ve had with the phone so far, but I’d imagine it might come in handy in harshly lit scenes such as parties where specialized colored lighting is in use.Notably, too, the codename for this feature is called “chameleon.” At this point in time, we’re not 100% sure if Google plans to bring this to other Pixel phones, as it may be tied to the new Tensor chip.Pixel 6 is shipping now from the Google Store and other major retailers.

"Scientists reel as Brazilian government backtracks on research funds - Nature.com

            and JavaScript.The Brazilian science community is aghast at being dealt yet another blow over research funding. On 15 October, President Jair Bolsonaro signed a bill sending 600 million reais (US$106.3 million) earmarked for the country’s Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation to several other government departments. The promise of the money earlier in the year triggered Brazil’s main science-funding agency to initiate its first ‘Universal Call’ for research-grant applications since 2018. Now, the 8,000 research proposals submitted face an uncertain future.


Years of funding cuts have been a hard pill to swallow for researchers in Brazil. The country’s main science agencies and funds received only 4.4 billion reais last year, about one-third of what they got in 2015, when funding peaked at 14 billion reais. Corrected for inflation, this is the smallest investment in research since 2004.Researchers feel demoralized by the last-minute loss of funds promised this year. “The whole situation is depressing,” says Patricia Endo, a computer scientist at the University of Pernambuco in Caruaru, who is part of a team that submitted a proposal to the Universal Call to apply artificial intelligence to studying maternal health. “If it were not for my family, I would have left the country already.”The promised research money would have come from a special fund for industrial innovation and research, called the National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FNDCT). Taxes collected from industrial sectors such as biotechnology and energy mainly support the fund. Each year, a portion of the funds from the FNDCT are counted towards the science budget, says Paulo Almeida, executive director at the non-profit Science Question Institute in São Paulo. “But political allocation criteria keep it mostly frozen, doled out only with Congress approving specific bills releasing the funds,” he says.


This year, some 690 million reais would have been added to science funding, 655 million of which would have come from the FNDCT to support the National Institutes of Science and Technology and programmes including the Universal Call.In early October, however, the economics ministry asked for a redistribution of the promised money. Instead of going to science and technology, the ministry proposed that it be distributed among departments such as infrastructure, agriculture, health and education and taken out of a 2020 government financial surplus. The science ministry will receive only a little over 7 million reais, and the National Commission on Nuclear Energy will get more than 82 million reais, to pay for the production of radiopharmaceuticals. These drugs are used to treat people with cancer, and their production in Brazil was halted last month because of lack of funding.To former science minister Sergio Rezende, the amount the government releases from the FNDCT each year is a thermometer gauging its support for science. “Science has no value to the present government,” he says.The biggest gut punch for researchers is the uncertainty now surrounding the Universal Call, which broadly funds research in areas from science to the humanities. Originally, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Brazil’s top science-funding agency, planned to use 200 million reais of the promised money for awarding grants to researchers through the call. It had not run a Universal Call since 2018 because of a shortage of funds.Thousands of research proposals involving more than 30,000 scientists flooded in when this year’s call opened. Now, scientists await the results — to be released in November — without knowing whether there’s any possibility of funding.


“I spent some time to try and let the news sink in,” says Luisa Viegas, a biologist at the Federal University of Alagoas in Maceió, who proposed a three-year project to study how climate change threatens the existence of amphibians and reptiles in Brazil.“We mobilized so much effort and energy to put the project together,” she says, noting that the project would have involved 30 researchers from Brazil and the United States. “Now, we’re thinking of submitting it to international funders, but it won’t be that easy because it’s really Brazil-specific.”When asked by Nature why it prioritized other areas over science for receiving the funds, Brazil’s economics ministry responded by e-mail that it alone was not responsible for the change. “The change was decided by the government, with the support of the Budget Execution Board.”


In its request to divert the funds, the ecoomics ministry pointed out that the science ministry had not yet used all the money available in its budget for 2021.To physicist Ildeu Moreira at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, a former president of the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science, the re-routing of funds is the latest of the Bolsonaro administration’s anti-science manoeuvres. “It’s a deliberate dismantling of science,” he says.But some have not given up hope. Evaldo Vilela, CNPq’s president, says there is a new bill in the works that will attempt to recover the lost funding. It garnered support from politicians across multiple parties, and if it’s approved quickly, he says, “we can still have the Universal Call for this year”.doi: ",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
