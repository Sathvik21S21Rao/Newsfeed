Hongkongers who scored a copy started an anonymous online spreadsheet to tell others where they could find them.To get a sense of the scale of the demise in working conditions for journalists in Hong Kong, it’s worth going back to the inaugural . Just five years after the handover from Britain to China, Hong Kong ranked 18th in the world - one level below the United States and four above the United Kingdom. The criteria included independence, diversity, censorship, transparency and legislation.It is now ranked 80th, below Kyrgyzstan and Kosovo.The shut down of the last pro-democracy newspaper in the city means independent coverage outside of the Alibaba-owned South China Morning Post will be left to a small band of online outlets including Citizen News, Stand News and Hong Kong Free Press.The chilling effect on all of them and anyone they interview is real.Kevin Carrico, an Apple Daily columnist and senior lecturer in Chinese studies at Monash University, said he was drawn partly to Hong Kong after leaving China because of the dynamism and diversity of Hong Kong’s media scene.“The city that used to be known for freedom of the press, for dynamic and open debate, is now genuinely missing those freedoms,” he said.Customers queue up for last issue of Apple Daily at a newspaper booth at a downtown street in Hong Kong on Thursday. Credit:APHong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam offered reporters an impossible task when she was asked by journalists how they could avoid breaching the national security laws, given they covered any threat to the authority of the state.“I think you are in a better position to answer that question,” she said on Tuesday. “Don’t try to beautify these acts of endangering national security. Don’t try to accuse the Hong Kong authorities [of] using the national security law as a tool to suppress the media or to stifle the freedom of expression.”Lam said there was no problem with criticising the Hong Kong government but inciting subversion crossed a red line.The challenge for the media and the public is knowing where that line is.Hongkongers were arrested in July for holding up blank pieces of paper after political slogans were banned. A year later, public gatherings outside of more than four are still outlawed under COVID-19 restrictions, yet banquets for more than 180 people inside restaurants are now allowed.A vender adjusts a stack of last issue of Apple Daily at a newspaper booth in Hong Kong.

Financial analysts are likely to think twice before reporting negative outlooks for Chinese state-owned companies. Academics are already avoiding any direct criticism of the government; fewer still are willing to be quoted on the record.That’s an environment where accountability goes out the window.“I’m not in the field of business or finance but if I was I wouldn’t feel too comfortable about the Hong Kong government’s ability to treat Apple Daily this way,” said Carrico.Carrico said Apple Daily was a product of Hong Kong’s unique circumstances.“It’s a newspaper established by Lai, an immigrant to Hong Kong from China, who eventually ended up building one of the newspapers that was most confrontational and critical of China’s takeover of Hong Kong’s institutions,” he said.“To think that Jimmy Lai, or other editors at Apple Daily are facing potential life sentences for really what boiled down to nothing more than speech crimes, it's really beyond comprehension.”Staff applaud Chan Pui-man, right, associate publisher of Apple Daily and Lam Man-chung, executive editor-in-chief of Apple Daily after the final edition is sent to the printers.

It has been 18 months since COVID-19 began to grab the world’s attention, quickly spreading from the Chinese city of Wuhan before infecting and killing millions and overwhelming health systems in all corners of the globe.The global death toll is rapidly approaching 4 million, with 180 million people infected with the virus at some stage. During this time the virus has not only spread but has also mutated multiple times. There are now several variants of the original COVID-19 virus that are more transmissible, with one predicted to soon be the world’s dominant variant.Late last month, the World Health Organisation (WHO) renamed the different variants after letters of the Greek alphabet.In Australia, there are three variants of concern: Alpha, Kappa and Delta. They are also sparking record high infections in parts of Europe and the subcontinent, while variants known as Beta and Gamma are also wreaking havoc in Africa and South America.The WHO is closely watching the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, but Delta is the one of most concern.The Beta variant was first identified in South Africa, but health experts say there have been very very few cases of it in Australia. EPACOVID-19 is caused by an RNA virus, the same virus which causes influenza.Professor Robert Booy, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Sydney and the Immunisation Coalition, said that RNA viruses tend to mutate “very easily”.“COVID-19, like influenza, doesn't copy itself very well at all, so the progeny, the babies of one virus, can be slightly different, mutated from the original virus,” he told SBS News.“Viruses want to survive just like how you and I want to survive, and so although they don't have volition, they can't make a decision. The viruses that do survive are those that can transmit. So in mutating, those that are able to transmit from one person to another, and on and on, are those that become entrenched in the community.”Delta, first identified in India, is now being reported in more than 80 countries and has health authorities increasingly worried due to how highly transmissible it is. It is behind and was seen during a recent outbreak in Melbourne.“The Delta variant is well on its way to becoming the dominant variant globally because of its increased transmissibility,” WHO’s chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said last week.READ MORECatherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University, said Delta “is pretty much everywhere where COVID is at the moment”. “It's a variant that we've been watching because we have seen it outcompete the other variants of concern,” she said.“It can quickly outcompete the other variants that are there. We saw it in England, we're seeing it across Europe now, and we're also seeing it in the US. It's quickly becoming established in some areas as the dominant strain.”A woman receives her vaccine in Kolkata, India. The highly Delta variant was first identified in India.PIYAL ADHIKARY/EPAJust three months after being first detected in the UK, Delta now makes up more than 99 per cent of cases there. It is also making up 90 per cent of new infections in Russia, where record high daily cases are being reported compared to the start of the pandemic. “This particular variant is potentially 60 per cent more infectious than we saw with the Alpha variant and that already was 50 per cent more infectious than other variants,” Professor Bennett said. Research from Public Health England estimates Delta has a reproductive value of 6.0, compared to between 2-3 from the other variants. That means for every one person infected with Delta, six other people will catch the virus.READ MORE“Researchers found that with the Delta variant, the 'viral load' carried by those infected is higher than other variants,” Professor Bennett said. “[It] builds quicker and people can become infectious sooner, with people likely to be more infectious due to the high viral load.And while data suggests it is more transmissible, epidemiologists say it is too soon to know if it causes more severe illness.India is also currently monitoring a new variant, known as Delta Plus, with its health ministry reporting 22 cases.India's federal health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the same variant has been found in eight other countries and is being closely watched, but the original Delta variant remains the most concerning. Alpha, the variant originally associated with the UK, may have been replaced by the Delta variant as the most dominant there, but it remains an issue for health authorities in many countries, including Australia.It is 50 per cent more contagious than the original COVID-19 virus.“Alpha is also of concern and is spreading,” Professor Booy said.""We're still seeing the Alpha strain coming in on our borders, that's the variant associated with the Queensland flight crew case and hotel transmission there,” Professor Bennett said.Technicians prepare vaccines at a COVID-19 vaccination centre in Sydney. AAPProfessor Bennett said Alpha was becoming the dominant variant in Australia, but it has been overtaken by Delta.“We were seeing [Alpha] being brought in with returning travellers.” “But now - whether it's people from Asia, Europe or North America - the chances are it's going to be a Delta variant if they do happen to be positive. So I think we have to get used to the fact that Delta will be the dominant global variant, and that's the one we really need to be focused on.”There are also warnings in Australia about the Kappa variant - also known as the ‘other’ variant - that was first identified in India.“Several months ago, people noticed that there was a mutant strain developing in India,” Professor Booy said.“They called it a double mutant, but indeed there was probably a dozen mutations that led to this new variant.”READ MORE“We saw Kappa in Victoria in the recent outbreak - that contributed to nearly 100 cases,” Professor Bennett said.Health experts say the concern is that Delta and Kappa are much more transmissible, spreading throughout India and the subcontinent, and now in Australia too.“We really need to respond as well as can ... We need to maximise the sensible precautions we've always been making; wearing masks, that's a good idea, but also social distancing - keep it up,” Professor Booy said. The vaccines being widely used in Australia are Pfizer and AstraZeneca.Professor Bennett said both have been the predominant vaccines in the UK and both have been shown to be protective against Delta but are slightly less effective compared to original variants.""It's not too bad if you get to that second dose. For fully vaccinated people there's still good protection against this particular variant,” she said. “What we've seen in the UK is 83 per cent of cases [of Delta] are in people who aren't vaccinated. And in fact, of the cases, 3.7 per cent of those were people who were fully vaccinated. So vaccination is still our best strategy.""READ MOREProfessor Bennett said both vaccinations both have high rates of protection against hospitalisation when it comes to the Delta variant.“For vaccine efficacy, the numbers that have come out of the UK lately show that if you're fully vaccinated - and we're talking about protection now against serious illness and hospitalisation - you still have between 96 to 92 per cent coverage, protection - whether you have had AstraZeneca or Pfizer after your second dose.” People queue outside the Melbourne Exhibition Centre coronavirus vaccination hub.AAPFresh data from Public Health England and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine also suggests the Delta variant is more susceptible to the vaccine when it comes to serious illnesses.""It seems that there is a slight reduction in overall effectiveness against infection when you go from the original Wuhan variants to the Alpha variant, and a slight drop away again with the Delta variant,"" Professor Bennett said.""But they're still high; we're talking about a 10 per cent drop, so it might drop from 88 per cent to 80 per cent or thereabouts. It really means that the higher the vaccine coverage in the community the better, just to offset that slight drop in efficacy.""Professor Booy said both vaccines are even more effective against Alpha and Kappa, and is urging Australians to get vaccinated as soon as they are able to book an appointment to do so.“This is a really dangerous time because we are becoming lax and complacent just as the virus is becoming more transmissible,” he said.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg

      Most of the patients taken to regional hospitals weren’t critical, he said: ""The critical patients were already dead."" Like others, he spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.A military spokesman, Col. Getnet Adane, told journalists that fighters supporting the Tigray region’s former leaders had assembled to celebrate Martyrs’ Day when the airstrike occurred.""The Ethiopian air force uses the latest technology, so it conducted a precision strike that was successful,"" he said.But the doctor who reached the scene said ""most of the patients we found were mothers, children and elderly fathers. There were few young men.""The airstrike wounded more than 100 people, half of them seriously, a regional health official said. Health workers said Ethiopian forces blocked medical teams from responding and shot at a Red Cross ambulance trying to reach the scene.Bodies were still being pulled from the rubble and dozens of survivors were still arriving at regional hospitals with shrapnel and blunt trauma wounds two days after the airstrike, said a doctor in the regional capital, Mekele. The International Committee of the Red Cross called the transport of seriously injured to Mekele ""a matter of life and death.""Even on Thursday, United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that the U.N. still hasn’t been able to reach the scene. ""Between the fighting and different groups on the ground we need clearance to go and we’ve just not been able to get it,"" he said.The airstrike, one of the worst massacres of the war, came amid some of the fiercest fighting in Tigray since the conflict began in November as Ethiopian forces, supported by neighboring Eritrea, pursue Tigray’s former leaders.The Ethiopian military spokesman denied Tigray fighters’ claims of gains in recent days, saying Ethiopian forces had been deployed to other locations for Monday’s national election.The United States and the European Union have condemned the airstrike in Togoga that left children, including a 1-year-old baby. screaming in pain.A ""reprehensible act,"" the U.S. State Department said. ""Denying victims urgently needed medical care is heinous and absolutely unacceptable. We urge the Ethiopian authorities to ensure full and unhindered medical access to the victims immediately. We also call for an urgent and independent investigation.""The U.S. also called for an immediate cease-fire in Tigray, where thousands of civilians have been killed and 350,000 people are now facing one of the world’s worst famines in years.""At least 33,000 children in inaccessible parts of Tigray are severely malnourished and face imminent death without immediate help,"" the latest U.N. humanitarian update said Thursday.Ethiopia claims that aid is being delivered to most of Tigray’s 6 million people, but aid workers have said they have been repeatedly denied access to several parts of the region by soldiers.With Ethiopia recently declaring Tigray’s former ruling party a terrorist group, concerns have been widespread among Tigrayans, aid workers and others that anyone seen as linked to Tigray fighters, including civilians, could be targeted.Tigrayans were appalled by Ethiopia’s assertion that the airstrike was aimed only at combatants.""It’s an insult to the people and adding salt to the wounds, you know?"" said Hailu Kebede, a former Togoga resident and official with the Salsay Woyane Tigray opposition party. He described how his brother, who has a shop in the market, ran for his life while his nearby home was destroyed.""We know the area. I grew up there. There were no combatants,"" Hailu said. ""The destroyed homes are those of my friends and my family.""One of his friends lost a child in the airstrike while another child had her hand amputated, he said.The real death toll from the airstrike could be even higher because some people likely took the dead home to their nearby villages and buried them without telling regional officials, Hailu said.",https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/24aa87e9-68a2-41d4-9f52-3c11b37519aa/2839ae87-90a6-4b63-8819-c25759e9ac0e/1280x720/match/931/524/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,"Hawaii set to drop quarantine, testing requirements for fully vaccinated US travelers | TheHill - The Hill
Hawaii is set to drop its quarantine and testing requirements for fully vaccinated U.S. travelers in July.The travel restriction will end in two weeks on July 8, Governor David Ige (D) announced Thursday, according to The Associated Press. Hawaii is one of a handful of states that have maintained a majority of their coronavirus restrictions — social distancing and masks are still required inside businesses.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in May changed its guidelines, stating that fully vaccinated individuals can go maskless in most indoor settings. Those who wish to travel to the state and avoid the mandated quarantine will have to prove their vaccination status with a hard copy of their vaccine card while traveling and a digital copy uploaded to a state website, according to AP.Businesses will not be allowed to increase their capacity from 75 percent, or do away with social distancing guidelines between tables until 70 percent of residents are fully vaccinated. Thus far, 60 percent of the state's population is fully vaccinated, and Hawaii was one of the first 10 states to meet the Biden administration's goal to have 70 percent of its adult population receive at least one shot of the coronavirus vaccine by July 4.All pandemic restrictions will be lifted once Hawaii reaches the 70 percent marker, AP noted. SponsoredThe Hill 1625 K Street, NW Suite 900 Washington DC 20006 | 202-628-8500 tel | 202-628-8503 faxThe contents of this site are ",https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_small_article/public/hawaii_042320getty.jpg?itok=NtYblQl0,"US says 'all countries should be concerned' about arms sales to Myanmar junta - Yahoo News
The United States said the international community should be ""concerned"" about arms sales to the military junta in Myanmar without mentioning any suppliers by name.As Myanmar faces increased isolation from the world following the military coup of Feb. 1 and the ensuing crackdown on democratic protesters, Russia fills the void by providing increased support through military aid. The Kremlin's recent warming toward the military junta in the Southeast Asian country directly contrasts with increasing Western condemnation.The Biden administration praised recent sanctions from the United Kingdom and European Union directed toward the junta.""We welcome the U.K.’s and EU's sanctions on Burmese individuals and entities announced on June 21. The international community's unified message is clear: We will continue promoting accountability for the regime to support the aspirations of the Burmese people,"" a State Department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner.""All countries should be concerned about sales to the Burmese military that could be used in the regime's campaign of oppression. This includes traditional weapons, dual-use items, and digital tools of suppression,"" the representative added.The statement did not directly address increased Russian support for the embattled regime.Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s junta leader, traveled to Moscow on Monday for a three-day “international security conference,” where the two countries discussed their mutual interests in fighting “terrorism,” regional security, and concerns over foreign interference in Myanmar, according to the Moscow Times. Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of Russia’s Security Council, met with Hlaing personally, and the two countries “reaffirmed their desire to further strengthen bilateral cooperation,"" Russia's Security Council said.The meeting marks the latest of one of Hlaing's numerous visits to Russia over the years.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov stated Russian President Vladimir Putin will not meet with the Junta leader.Russia stands as one of the Myanmar military junta’s highest-profile allies, alongside China. But while China has misgivings about the coup, according to the East Asia Forum, Russia sees much to benefit from as its ties with the military are extensive. Russia was one of the few countries to refuse to condemn the February coup, merely expressing hope toward “a peaceful settlement of the situation through the resumption of political dialogue.”Activists have decried the Kremlin’s relationship with the junta as legitimizing the dictatorship’s rule. The Kremlin insists it’s simply carrying on with its long-running relationship with Myanmar, which dates back to the 1950s.The U.S. has led the international effort against the military junta that ousted the democratic government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, earlier this year. The Biden administration first issued sanctions against the generals behind the coup on Feb. 10, followed by an order to end all trade and investment in the country after the massacre of protesters by the military in March. On Monday, the EU imposed a third round of sanctions on Myanmar military officials and state companies.On Saturday, the United Nations General Assembly issued a resolution urging the restoration of democracy, and an end to violence, calling on constituent countries to refrain from selling arms to Myanmar.The army’s crackdown on protests has resulted in over 880 deaths and 5,000 arrests, according to the advocacy group .Washington Examiner VideosTags: Burma, Myanmar, Coup, Military, Russia, National SecurityOriginal Author: Brady KnoxOriginal Location: ",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6vPNZOSdeQsnMCAGutX21A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTQzMC4zMjQ2NzUzMjQ2NzUz/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jU_jviRzXav3zw93380COw--~B/aD05NDA7dz0xNTQwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/washington_examiner_articles_265/e158b33b16eded451a7b9dfc18adaeb6
"Doval at Dushanbe: Pak NSA listening, India proposes action against LeT, Jaish within SCO framework - The Indian Express
With his Pakistani counterpart Moeed Yusuf listening, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval on Wednesday “proposed an action plan against Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) as part of the SCO framework”, sources said on Thursday.Doval was speaking at the meeting of NSAs from  member countries in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan.Doval also emphasised “adoption of international standards to counter terror financing, including an MoU between SCO and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)”, the sources said.The FATF, which is the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, is currently holding a meeting to decide whether to retain Pakistan on its ‘grey list’.Doval “strongly condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations”, and said that “perpetrators of terrorism including cross-border terror attacks should be expeditiously brought to justice”, the sources said.He stressed the “need for full implementation of UN resolutions and targeted sanctions against UN designated terrorist individuals and entities” — a reference to the absence of action by Pakistan against LeT chief Hafiz Saeed and JeM chief Masood Azhar.There is a “need to preserve gains made in the last two decades in Afghanistan and give top priority to the welfare of its people”, Doval said.India, he said, “fully supports SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan, which should be more active”.He underlined that “greater connectivity including through initiatives like Chabahar, INSTC, Regional Air Corridors, Ashgabat Agreement always leads to economic gains and building trust”.Without mentioning the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Doval said that “connectivity must respect sovereignty and territorial integrity”. India is opposed to the CPEC — it has maintained that the corridor, which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, violates India’s sovereignty.At the meeting, Doval also stressed the “need to monitor new technologies used by terrorists including drones for smuggling of weapons and misuse of dark web, artificial intelligence, blockchain and social media”.The statement, issued in Tajik, said special attention was given to the “current military and political situation in Afghanistan”, and the risk of “escalation”.While there was no word on the possible meeting between Doval and Yusuf, the fact that the two NSAs shared a table was significant given the fluid situation in Afghanistan and the fragile, four-month peace along the LoC.On Afghanistan, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “India supports all peace initiatives and has a long-term commitment towards development and reconstruction of Afghanistan. In this context, we remain in touch with various stakeholders, including regional countries.”
Shubhajit Roy...",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/06/PTI06_24_2021_000078B.jpg,"These countries relied on Chinese vaccines. Now they’re battling outbreaks. - The Indian Express
Written by Sui-Lee WeeMongolia promised its people a “COVID-free summer.” Bahrain said there would be a “return to normal life.” The tiny island nation of the Seychelles aimed to jump-start its economy.All three put their faith, at least in part, in easily accessible Chinese-made vaccines, which would allow them to roll out ambitious inoculation programs at a time when much of the world was going without.But instead of freedom from the coronavirus, all three countries are now battling a surge in infections.China kicked off its vaccine diplomacy campaign last year by pledging to provide a shot that would be safe and effective at preventing severe cases of COVID-19. Less certain at the time was how successful it and other vaccines would be at curbing transmission.Now, examples from several countries suggest that the Chinese vaccines may not be very effective at preventing the spread of the virus, particularly the new variants. The experiences of those countries lay bare a harsh reality facing a post-pandemic world: The degree of recovery may depend on which vaccines governments give to their people.In the Seychelles, Chile, Bahrain and Mongolia, 50% to 68% of the populations have been fully inoculated, outpacing the United States, according to Our World in Data, a data tracking project. All four ranked among the top 10 countries with the worst COVID outbreaks as recently as last week, according to data from The New York Times. And all four are mostly using shots made by two Chinese vaccine makers, Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech.“If the vaccines are sufficiently good, we should not see this pattern,” said Jin Dongyan, a virus expert at the University of Hong Kong. “The Chinese have a responsibility to remedy this.”Scientists don’t know for certain why some countries with relatively high inoculation rates are suffering new outbreaks. Variants, social controls that are eased too quickly and careless behavior after only the first of a two-shot regimen are possibilities. But the breakthrough infections could have lasting consequences.In the United States, about 45% of the population is fully vaccinated, mostly with doses made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Cases have dropped 94% over six months.Israel provided shots from Pfizer and has the second-highest vaccination rate in the world, after the Seychelles. The number of new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Israel is now around 4.95 per million.In the Seychelles, which relied mostly on Sinopharm, that number is more than 716 cases per million.Disparities such as these could create a world in which three types of countries emerge from the pandemic — the wealthy nations that used their resources to secure Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots, the poorer countries that are far away from immunizing a majority of citizens, and then those that are fully inoculated but only partly protected.China, as well as the more than 90 nations that have received the Chinese shots, may end up in the third group, contending with rolling lockdowns, testing and limits on day-to-day life for months or years to come. Economies could remain held back. And as more citizens question the efficacy of Chinese doses, persuading unvaccinated people to line up for shots may also become more difficult.One month after receiving his second dose of Sinopharm, Otgonjargal Baatar fell ill and tested positive for COVID-19. The 31-year-old miner spent nine days in a hospital in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. He said he was now questioning the usefulness of the shot. “People were convinced that if we were vaccinated, the summer will be free of COVID,” he said. “Now it turns out that it’s not true.”Beijing saw its vaccine diplomacy as an opportunity to emerge from the pandemic as a more influential global power. China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, pledged to deliver a Chinese shot that could be easily stored and transported to millions of people around the world. He called it a “global public good.”Mongolia was a beneficiary, jumping at the chance to score millions of Sinopharm shots. The small country quickly rolled out an inoculation program and eased restrictions. It has now vaccinated 52% of its population. But on Sunday, it recorded 2,400 new infections, a quadrupling from a month before.In a statement, China’s Foreign Ministry said it did not see a link between the recent outbreaks and its vaccines. It cited the World Health Organization as saying that vaccination rates in certain countries had not reached sufficient levels to prevent future outbreaks, and that countries needed to continue to maintain controls.“Relevant reports and data also show that many countries that use Chinese-made vaccines have expressed that they are safe and reliable, and have played a good role in their epidemic prevention efforts,” the ministry said. China has also emphasized that its vaccines target severe disease rather than transmission.No vaccine fully prevents transmission and people can still fall ill after being inoculated, but the relatively low efficacy rates of Chinese shots have been identified as a possible cause of the recent outbreaks.Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have efficacy rates of more than 90%. A variety of other vaccines — including AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson — have efficacy rates of around 70%. The Sinopharm vaccine developed with the Beijing Institute of Biological Products has an efficacy rate of 78.1%; the Sinovac vaccine has an efficacy rate of 51%.The Chinese companies have not released much clinical data to show how their vaccines work at preventing transmission. On Monday, Shao Yiming, a public health researcher with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that China needed to fully vaccinate 80% to 85% of its population to achieve herd immunity, revising a previous official estimate of 70%.Data on breakthrough infections has not been made available either, though a Sinovac study out of Chile showed that the vaccine was less effective than those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at preventing infection among vaccinated individuals.A representative from Sinopharm hung up the phone when reached for comment. Sinovac did not respond to a request for comment.William Schaffner, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University, said the efficacy rates of Chinese shots could be low enough “to sustain some transmission, as well as create illness of a substantial amount in the highly vaccinated population, even though it keeps people largely out of the hospital.”Despite the spike in cases, officials in both the Seychelles and Mongolia have defended Sinopharm, saying it is effective in preventing severe cases of the disease.Batbayar Ochirbat, head researcher of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies at Mongolia’s Ministry of Health, said that Mongolia had made the right decision to go with the Chinese-made shot, in part because it had helped keep the mortality rate low in the country. Data from Mongolia showed that the Sinopharm vaccine was actually more protective than the doses developed by AstraZeneca and Sputnik, a Russian vaccine, according to the health ministry.The reason for the surge in Mongolia, Batbayar said, is that the country reopened too quickly, and many people believed they were protected after only one dose. “I think you could say Mongolians celebrated too early,” he said. “My advice is the celebrations should start after the full vaccinations, so this is the lesson learned. There was too much confidence.”Some health officials and scientists are less confident.Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor at the College of Medicine and Public Health at Flinders University in Australia, said that with all of the evidence, it would be reasonable to assume the Sinopharm vaccine has minimal effect on curbing transmission. A major risk with the Chinese inoculation is that vaccinated people may have few or no symptoms and still spread the virus to others, he said.“I think that this complexity has been lost on most decision-makers around the world.”In Indonesia, where a new variant is spreading, more than 350 doctors and health care workers recently came down with COVID-19 despite being fully vaccinated with Sinovac, according to the risk mitigation team of the Indonesian Medical Association. Across the country, 61 doctors died between February and June 7. Ten of them had taken the Chinese-made vaccine, the association said.The numbers were enough to make Kenneth Mak, Singapore’s director of medical services, question the use of Sinovac. “It’s not a problem associated with Pfizer,” said Mak at a news conference on Friday. “This is actually a problem associated with the Sinovac vaccine.”Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates were the first two countries to approve the Sinopharm shot, even before late-stage clinical trial data was released. Since then, there have been extensive reports of vaccinated people falling ill in both countries. In a statement, the Bahraini government’s media office said the kingdom’s vaccine rollout had been “efficient and successful to date.”Still, last month officials from Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates announced they would offer a third booster shot. The choices: Pfizer or more Sinopharm.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/01/Sinovac-China.jpg
"Hong Kong's Apple Daily to live on in blockchain, free of censors - CNA
HONG KONG: Hong Kong cyber activists are backing up articles by Apple Daily on censorship-proof blockchain platforms after the newspaper was forced to shut down as it became embroiled in a national security law crackdown.The latest drive to preserve the paper's content comes after activists rushed to upload documentaries by local broadcaster RTHK investigating people in power after the media outlet said it would remove materials older than one year from its social media platforms.Under the national security law, the Hong Kong government can request the blocking or removal of content it deems subversive or secessionist, raising fears over internet freedom in the global financial hub.The Hong Kong government says use of the Internet will not be affected so long as its use is within the law.""Law enforcement actions taken by Hong Kong law enforcement agencies are based on evidence, strictly according to the laws of Hong Kong, and for the acts of the person(s) or entity(ies) concerned,” a spokesman for the Security Bureau said.This year, the company that approves Internet domains in Hong Kong said it would reject any sites that could incite ""illegal acts"". Internet service provider Hong Kong Broadband Network (HKBN) said it had blocked access to HKChronicles, a website offering information about anti-government protests.Fearing the security law could bring elements of China's great firewall to Hong Kong, limiting access to dissenting views, 21-year-old Ho - who works in tech and did not give his first name because of the sensitivity of the matter - began this week to upload Apple Daily articles on decentralised file storage platform ARWeave.After midnight, as the printers ran one final time, Apple Daily shut off its website and erased all its social media platforms after authorities froze company-related assets as part of a national security probe.""I’m not doing this because I love Apple Daily, it’s what needs to be done,"" Ho said. ""I never thought that Apple Daily would disappear so quickly.""

Police froze assets of companies linked to Apple Daily and arrested five executives last week, moves that led to the newspaper printing its final edition on Thursday (Jun 24). Authorities have said dozens of Apple Daily articles may have violated the security law, but there was no suggestion that Apple Daily content would be blocked or censored.Similar to BitTorrent, ARWeave breaks down a file into bits of information distributed over an open network of anonymous computers around the world. On its website, it describes itself as a ""collectively owned hard drive that never forgets"". As of Thursday, more than 4,000 Apple Daily articles had been uploaded on ARWeave. Hundreds of RTHK programmes dating back to 2012 are also available.Another programmer, Kin Ko, 47, has been building a decentralised registry called LikeCoin. The blockchain platform helps internet users identify the metadata - creator, date, time, location, version - of the content through a unique number called an International Standard Content Number (ISCN), akin to a book's distinctive International Standard Book Number.Any changes made to the content would be known and tracked through changes to its digital fingerprint.The digital repository is still in its beta phase and months away from launching officially. But online pro-democracy outlet Citizen News told Reuters its has already used LikeCoin to catalogue its images.Ko's initial idea was to create a platform that could authenticate any type of content, and did not expect his platform to be embraced so enthusiastically by pro-democracy activists.But, he said: ""History must not be determined by those in power.""",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Miami building collapse: At least 1 dead, 99 unaccounted for as search and rescue continues - The Straits Times
MIAMI (REUTERS, AFP) - Rescue crews near Miami combed through tonnes of rubble on Thursday (June 24) for anyone who may have survived the pre-dawn collapse of part of an oceanfront residential tower, with officials reporting at least one person found dead and nearly 100 more missing.Ms Sally Heyman, a Miami-Dade county commissioner, said officials have been unable to make contact with 51 individuals who “supposedly” live in the building, home to a mix of people including families and part-time “snow bird” residents who spend the winter months in Florida.Miami-Dade police director Freddy Ramirez later told reporters that 99 people were unaccounted for and that 53 others whose whereabouts were initially unknown have since been located, though he did not make clear whether everyone in the second group was alive.“Fire and rescue are in there with their search team, with their dogs. It’s a very dangerous site right now. Very unstable,” Mr Ramirez told reporters.“They’re in search-and-rescue mode, and they will be in that mode for a while. They are not quitting. They’re going to work through the night. They are not stopping.”Mr Ramirez said the numbers of known casualties and people missing were likely to fluctuate.“I don’t want to set false expectations,” he said. “This is a very tragic situation for those families and for the community.”A fire official said 35 people were rescued from the building in Surfside, a seaside enclave of 5,700 residents on a barrier island across Biscayne Bay from the city of Miami, including two who were pulled from the rubble as response teams used trained dogs and drones in the search for survivors.Officials said the building, built in 1981, was going through a recertification process requiring repairs and that another building was being built next door, although the cause of the collapse remained unclear.“We have 51 people that were assumed to have been there, but you don’t know between vacations or anything else, so we’re still waiting,” Ms Heyman told CNN by phone earlier in the day. “The hope is still there, but it’s waning.”Ms Jenny Urgelles woke up to the news that her parents’ building had collapsed. She called them, but both their phones went straight to voicemail, she told WSVN 7 News.“I am holding on to hope. I very desperate to know what’s happening,” she told the local Fox affiliate.Footage from WPLG Local 10, a Miami TV station, showed a rescue team pulling a boy from piles of debris and rebar, and firefighters using ladder trucks to rescue residents trapped on balconies.Boy rescued from the rubble of a building collapse in Surfside, Florida -- near Miami Beach.Hundreds of first responders are on the scene right now.Rescue operation continues at 8777 Collins Ave. #BREAKING: Video from a guest who was staying at a hotel across from that building collapse in Surfside, Florida near Miami Beach. @TND So a building next to my hotel collapsed in Miami Beach during the middle of the night. The search effort was slowed by at least one fire that burned at the site as emergency crews doused the rubble with water, local media reported.Emergency responders and officials were still looking for people who might be in the rubble, as well as trying to identify residents who were not home at 1.30am (1.30pm Singapore time), when an entire side of the building gave way and fell to the ground below.“We all woke up in the early morning hours to a tragic scene,” said Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who toured the scene of the catastrophe on Thursday afternoon. “We still have hope to identify additional survivors.”At least six Paraguayan nationals were among those unaccounted for, Paraguay’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement, including the sister of Paraguay’s First Lady, the sister’s husband Luis Pettengill and their three children.

The Champlain Towers South had more than 130 units, about 80 of which were occupied. It had been subject to various inspections recently due to the recertification process and the adjacent construction of a building called 88 Park, Surfside Commissioner Charles Kesl told Local 10.“There were garage underground issues related to that, to make sure that it was done soundly,” Mr Kesl said.“And, to my understanding, there were some cracks from that project – minor cracks – that were just patched up. Nothing, based on my understanding, to the magnitude that would indicate that there was a structural problem that could result in something so catastrophic.”Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said construction work was being done on the roof of the Champlain Towers South but there was no indication that it caused the collapse.“It’s hard to imagine how this could have happened,” Mr Burkett told reporters. “Buildings just don’t fall down.”Mr Burkett said that part of the building with balconies facing the beach collapsed, with one floor appearing to have fallen atop another, cascading down.“The back of the building, probably a third or more, is totally pancaked,” he said.

Resident Barry Cohen and his wife were rescued from the building.“At first it sounded like a flash of lightning or thunder,” Mr Cohen, a former vice-mayor of Surfside and a resident of the building, told reporters at the scene. “But then it just kept on - steadily for at least 15 to 30 seconds – it just kept on going and going and going.""Mr Cohen also said there had been construction for more than a month on the building’s roof.Mr Santo Mejil, a local resident, said his wife was an overnight caretaker who was in the complex when it collapsed.""She said she heard a big explosion. It felt like an earthquake,"" he told the Miami Herald newspaper, tearing up as his wife called again to say she was being evacuated from the complex.The Miami-Dade Police have assumed control of the investigation.

SHANGHAI: Wang Ying is young, educated and an unquestioning believer in the Communist Party's sole right to rule China - exactly what the increasingly conformist institution seeks as it enters a new century.As the ruling body celebrates its 100th birthday on Jul 1, current members describe an increasingly cult-like atmosphere under leader Xi Jinping, propagandising successes such as its control of the coronavirus, and viewed as the only viable saviour for China.

""Belief in the Party is steadfast. Perhaps not as deep as a religion like Buddhism or Christianity, but something that fosters self-discipline,"" said Wang, a partial pseudonym to protect the Party member's identity.The membership focus of the Chinese Communist Party has continually evolved, from intellectuals, to the proletariat, and welcoming entrepreneurs from the 1990s.Despite outward appearances, analysts say, it has always entertained a wide range of views on China's direction, but that resulted in factionalism, inefficiency and corruption.Members interviewed by AFP across China say Xi has tightened criteria to weed out potential troublemakers, running it more like a private corporation.

Today's multi-layered, more than two-year application process seeks the best and brightest regardless of ""class"" background, they said, with a premium on youth, college educations, and spotless personal histories as the Party looks to its future.In 2019, 50.7 per cent of members held academic degrees, up from 41.6 per cent in 2013, when Xi took over. Those from farming or labour backgrounds declined from 38.1 percent to 34.8 per cent.MANDATE OF HEAVENAbove all, the CCP seeks young acolytes raised on China's recent strengths - not past mistakes - and who possess unwavering belief in the Party.""(Today's) young Party members are more confident, ambitious and positive,"" said a 46-year-old member surnamed Song, an official at a university in eastern China.China's past emperors ruled via the ""Mandate of Heaven"", the idea that peace and prosperity bestowed divine endorsement on a particular dynasty.The Party is effectively claiming that mandate today, members say, with plenty of justification.China emerged relatively unscathed from the pandemic due to aggressive early lockdowns, Xi has aggressively cracked down on corruption and pollution and declared this year that extreme poverty had been eliminated. Chinese prosperity and global influence have soared.

These victories are being trumpeted nationwide by the Party and its members in a pre-anniversary propaganda blitz.But analysts warns of instability if Xi, now 68, were to pass away, as there is no clear successor, or if China's already slowing economy were to dip precipitously.Xi's rapid centralisation of power and emphasis on Party-led conformity - aided by a fast-growing and intrusive high-tech state security apparatus - also could kill the flexibility and spirit of economic experimentation that made China's newfound strength possible.Chinese youth disillusionment is already rising with the feeling that the low-hanging economic fruits have already been plucked, and that getting ahead is becoming more difficult.The Mercator Institute for China Studies said in a recent report that many Chinese are resigned to submit to a ""party state whose digital surveillance is increasingly encroaching on people's privacy"".

SYDNEY: Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), reported a double-digit rise in new locally acquired cases of COVID-19 for the third straight day as officials fight to contain an outbreak of the highly contagious Delta variant.""Since the pandemic has started, this is perhaps the scariest period that New South Wales is going through,"" state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.NSW has imposed tough restrictions in Sydney, Australia's largest city and home to a fifth of the country's 25 million population, with health officials saying transmission could be happening even through minimal contact with infected persons.NSW officials have so far resisted calls for a hard lockdown although Australia has a good record of successfully suppressing past outbreaks through snap lockdowns, tough social distancing rules and swift contact tracing.Australia has reported just under 30,400 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began.Berejiklian said despite the virus variant being very infectious, her government was ""at this stage comfortable"" with the current level of restrictions.Western Australia state premier Mark McGowan has urged NSW authorities to place the state in a lockdown to ""crush and kill"" the virus, warning ""light touch"" curbs could trigger a spike in infections. Western Australia has closed its border to NSW.NSW authorities have imposed mandatory masks in all indoor locations in Sydney, including offices, restricted residents in seven council areas in Sydney's east and inner west from leaving the city, and limited home gatherings to five to contain the state's first outbreak in more than a month.The state has been effectively isolated from the rest of the country after some states, like Western Australia, slammed their borders shut while others introduced tough border rules.Eleven new local cases were reported on Thursday (Jun 24), taking the total infections in the latest outbreak to more than 40. Thursday's data includes six cases detected after the 8pm cut-off deadline, which will be included in Friday's tally.NSW state parliament on Thursday released a restricted list of politicians allowed into the chamber after state Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall tested positive for COVID-19 and Health Minister Brad Hazzard in isolation after he was deemed to be a possible close contact of a positive case.Victoria state, which shares its border with NSW, on Thursday reported its first case likely linked to the NSW outbreak after a man in his 60s tested positive after returning home from Sydney. It reported another case earlier in the day linked to an existing cluster.Queensland state reported three new local cases but officials said the infections pose low risk to the community as they were in isolation when they contracted the virus.Neighbouring New Zealand reported no new local cases on Thursday, a day after it raised the alert level in the capital Wellington over exposure concerns after an Australian tourist tested positive for COVID-19 upon returning to Sydney after a weekend visit.Wellington moved to a 'level 2' alert, or one short of a lockdown, until Sunday midnight as a precaution against any potential outbreak.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
"John McAfee, antivirus software pioneer, found dead in prison cell - TimesLIVE
 John McAfee, the creator of the eponymous antivirus software, was found dead on Wednesday in prison outside Barcelona. He was 75.In recent years, McAfee became a prominent booster of cryptocurrencies, ran unsuccessfully for US president, had numerous run-ins with the law and traded in extreme conspiracy theories.McAfee was discovered dead in his prison cell hours after Spain’s national court approved his extradition to the US over multiple tax fraud charges. Security personnel at the Brians 2 prison in northeast Spain tried but failed to revive him, the Associated Press reported, citing a statement from the region’s government.McAfee had been in Spanish custody since October on a June 2020 US indictment in which he was charged with failing to file four years of tax returns while concealing assets. Then in March, he was indicted and accused of fraud and money laundering over his use of social media to promote cryptocurrencies, which prosecutors said generated $13m in illicit gains for McAfee and a co-conspirator.Nishay Sanan, McAfee’s attorney, said his colleagues in Spain confirmed that McAfee had been found dead in his jail cell. Sanan claimed the US government had identified McAfee as a target and “tried to erase him, but failed.”“John lived his life the way he saw fit,” Sanan said. “In the end that is all that matters. You don’t have to agree with his way  — he did not care.”The Justice Department declined to comment and a spokesperson referred questions to Spanish authorities.Before his legal turmoil, McAfee was a pioneer of the cybersecurity industry. He founded McAfee Corp in 1987 in Santa Clara, California, and led the company as it dominated the market for antivirus protection of personal computers. Half of all Fortune 100 companies were using his software during that time. McAfee resigned in 1994. Decades later he told the South China Morning Post that running the company no longer was fun as it grew to a huge corporation with thousands of employees.Intel Corp bought the company in 2010 and later rebranded all McAfee products as Intel Security. After his name was removed, McAfee told the BBC, “I am now everlastingly grateful to Intel for freeing me from this terrible association with the worst software on the planet.”McAfee relocated to Belize in 2008 after his $100m fortune was reduced to $4m  after a series of failed investments in property, real estate and bonds. There he had one of his biggest conflicts with authorities in 2012 after the killing of a neighbour, Gregory Faull, a 52-year-old contractor and Florida native. McAfee’s home on the island of Ambergris Caye was searched after Faull was shot dead  and police said they wanted to question him as part of a murder investigation.He then sought asylum in Guatemala in 2012, claiming he wasn’t on the run from authorities in Belize. He turned to social media and public interviews to salvage his reputation, sending updates to Wired magazine, allowing two reporters from Vice magazine to accompany him and posting missives to his own website. He discussed eluding police by burying himself in sand with a cardboard box and changing his appearance.McAfee was expelled from Guatemala and arrived in Miami in December 2012. In an interview with Bloomberg News the day of his departure, McAfee, then 67, said he was being forced out of Belize, but was “perfectly happy with the decision.” He apologised to Guatemala’s then-president for putting him in “a slippery position.” He was later ordered by a Florida judge to pay more than $25m to Faull’s estate.In 2016, McAfee announced a run as a presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party, campaigning on a privacy-focused platform that included pushing for the government to create a cybersecurity defence strategy. The party’s nomination was won by former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson.By 2017, McAfee jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon as  CEO of MGT Capital Investments Inc. He’d promised to turn the former video game operation into a profitable cybersecurity firm by ramping up its bitcoin mining business. He stepped down later that year to become the CEO of a cryptocurrency company, Luxcore.Part of his cryptocurrency venture included charging more than $105,000 per tweet to promote initial coin offerings. McAfee later told his Twitter followers he’d been forced to “go dark” on social media after receiving unspecified “threats” from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.During the period from 2014 to 2018 McAfee failed to file US tax returns, according to a federal indictment. After eluding law enforcement, he was arrested and detained last October in Spain. From prison, McAfee was able to use Twitter to continue promoting cryptocurrencies, but also to share his experience. In April, he tweeted: “This has been the most trying period in my life.” At that point, he had been in the Catalonian prison for six months.In November 2019, McAfee took to Twitter to show off his latest tattoo on his right bicep. It read, ‘$WHACKD.’ In a related tweet, he wrote: “Getting subtle messages from US officials saying, in effect: 'We’re coming for you McAfee! We’re going to kill yourself.' I got a tattoo today just in case. If I suicide myself, I didn’t. I was whackd. Check my right arm.”Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia reported that McAfee appeared to have died by suicide, citing a statement from the regional department of justice of Catalonia, where he was being held.“Sometimes genius and madness aren’t far apart and it seems he unfortunately fell prey to his demons,” said Doug Clinton, managing partner at Loup Ventures.Bloomberg.

A further six charges were subsequently added.He pleaded guilty to five counts of dissemination of terrorist publications and 11 counts of possession of a document containing information likely to be useful to a person preparing or committing an act of terrorism.Nugent pleaded not guilty to two counts of encouraging terrorism.

"Miami building collapse: 99 people unaccounted for as rescuers continue search for survivors - Sky News
Ninety-nine people remain unaccounted for and one person is dead after an apartment block partially collapsed near Miami - with footage showing a huge section of the 12-storey building being reduced to rubble as it crashed to the ground.The number of missing was updated by police and Miami-Dade mayor Daniella Levine Cava after officials initially said 51 people were unaccounted for.Ms Levine Cava also said 102 people are accounted for and safe as the search continues for survivors in the rubble at Champlain Towers South in the town of Surfside, Florida.The Jackson Memorial Hospital has confirmed it has received two patients from the site of the building collapse, which happened around 1.30am on Thursday local time (6.30am UK time).Brian Fincheltub, Venezuela's consular affairs director, said the country has identified four of its citizens who lived in the building and are missing. Argentina's consulate in Miami said nine of its citizens who lived in the building are missing.A family of three from Colombia are also missing and are feared to have been in the apartment block.Luis Fernando Barth Gomez, his wife Catalina Barth Gomez and their 14-year-old daughter Valeria Barth Gomez were staying on the second floor of the building, a family spokesperson told NBC News.Valeria was attending a tennis camp in South Florida. The family were last heard from at 8pm local time on Wednesday.Colombia's embassy in Miami has said six of its citizens are among those unaccounted for.A UK Foreign Office spokesperson has said the department is working with authorities in Miami to establish if any British nationals have been caught up in the disaster.US President Joe Biden spoke to Miami-Dade Mayor Levine Cava and offered federal assistance and support for dealing with the disaster.A White House official said: ""Our hearts go out to the families of those who lost their beloved as a result of this horrific incident - and to those families who wait in anguish as search-and-rescue teams assess the situation.""Footage from a nearby building appears to show the middle of the apartment block collapsing first, causing a huge cloud of dust as it is reduced to rubble in just a matter of seconds.Another section then appears to sway slightly before crashing to the ground, leaving what seems to be around half of the building still standing.Mrs Levine Cava posted on Twitter that she had signed a ""declaration of local state of emergency"" that will begin to allocate the necessary resources need to respond to the disaster.She urged Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to do the same.Mr DeSantis, who toured the scene of the catastrophe on Thursday afternoon, had earlier said officials were ""bracing for some bad news just given the destruction that we're seeing"".He added in a news conference: ""We all woke up in the early morning hours to a tragic scene.""We still have hope to identify additional survivors.""Charles Burkett, the town's mayor, confirmed in a news conference on Thursday morning that at least one person had died, while officials say 10 were injured.Mr Burkett warned that the building manager told him the tower was quite full and the number of dead was likely to rise.In an afternoon news conference held to provide an update on the tragedy, Mr Burkett told reporters: ""It was something like I never believed could happen.""It was a complete collapse of the building. I thought maybe a balcony had gone down, but we've got 134 units in that building, I understand, and literally half that building is not there anymore.""We're working hard... we've got resources like you can't believe here, we've got the dogs, we've got the equipment and we're going to do our very best to save as many people in that pile of rubble as we possibly can.""More than 80 fire and rescue units were at the beachfront apartment block after the collapse, with images showing a pile of rubble and debris spilling down from what was left of the balconies of the building.About 35 occupants who were trapped in the building were pulled from the rubble, a Miami-Dade Fire spokesperson said on Thursday morning.NBC Miami showed a video of a boy, who appeared to be in his early teens, being pulled out alive by firefighters.The footage shows a firefighter carrying the youngster over his shoulder after rescuing him from the rubble.""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and the victims"", said Alfredo Ramirez, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department told a press conference.Police have cordoned off nearby roads, with scores of fire and rescue vehicles, ambulances and police cars deployed in the area.Barry Cohen, 63, said he and his wife were asleep in the building when he first heard what he thought was a crack of lightning.The couple went on to their balcony, then opened the door to the building's hallway to find ""a pile of rubble and dust and smoke billowing around"".""I couldn't walk out past my doorway,"" said Mr Cohen, the former vice mayor of Surfside.""A gaping hole of rubble.""He and his wife eventually made it to the basement and found rising water there.They returned upstairs, screamed for help and were eventually brought to safety by firefighters using a cherry picker.Mr Cohen said he raised concerns years ago about whether nearby construction might be causing damage to the building after seeing cracked paving on the pool deck.So a building next to my hotel collapsed in Miami Beach during the middle of the night. Santo Mejil, 50, told the Miami Herald his wife called him from the building, where she was working as an aide for an elderly woman.""She said she heard a big explosion. It felt like an earthquake,"" Mr Mejil told the newspaper.He said she later called him and said rescuers were bringing her down.Champlain Towers South was built in 1981 and has more than 100 residential units, according to NBC News.It had a few two-bedroom units currently on the market, with asking prices of $600,000 to $700,000.The building is located across from a beach in the oceanfront community of about 6,000 people and police blocked nearby roads and traffic was being diverted early on Thursday.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/06/768x432/skynews-miami-buildings_5426531.jpg?20210624224015,"John McAfee dead latest – Antivirus software guru dies ‘by suicide’ as old Instagram & Twitter posts raise... - The Sun
BEFORE antivirus pioneer John McAfee reportedly killed himself after he was set to be extradited to the United States, he claimed that he was being targeted as he alleged that he had compiled files about “corruption” in governments.He said that he had been receiving “subtle messages” from US officials threatening him.The entrepreneur had also previously compared himself to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as he claimed that he would never die by suicide.Epstein was also found dead in a prison cell in 2019.“If I hang myself, a la Epstein, it will be no fault of mine,” He also showed off a tattoo on his arm reading “whackd” as he claimed again that he would never kill himself.If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text Crisis Text Line at 741741.Read our John McAfee live blog for the latest news and updates...JANICE MCAFEE SAID PEOPLE WANTED JOHN DEADThree days before his death, Janice also alleged people wanted him dead.""I know John is an extremely polarizing individual. Believe me, I know this better than most!"" Janice wrote in the lengthy note.""But I also know, as well as any of you who follow him on Twitter, that he has always been honest about who is is. ALWAYS. Sometimes too honest, sometimes sharing more than any of us cared to know about him!""John’s honesty has often gotten him in trouble with corrupt governments and corrupt government officials because of his outspoken nature and his refusal to be extorted, intimidated, or silenced,"" she claimed.""Now the US authorities are determined to have John in prison to make an example of him for speaking out against corruption within their government agencies.""JANICE MCAFEE CLAIMED HE WAS 'STRUGGLING' His wife Janice McAfee, a former prostitute, said he had been struggling ""both mentally and physically, as well as financially"" after eight months in prison. She claimed that his life could be ""irreparably destroyed"" by the ""court of public opinion"".MCAFEE HAD A 'TRYING PERIOD' WHILE IN PRISONLast month, McAfee shared what his prison life in Catalonia was like via Twitter, describing his lonely and isolated existence behind bars.He said: ""Imagine preschool where the kids use drugs, carry makeshift weapons and the teachers tase you for asking questions.""In a different tweet, he said: ""I speak no Catalan and little Spanish so human contact is limited. ""There are no entertainments – no escape from loneliness, from emptiness, from myself.""This has been the most trying period of my life.""MCAFEE ARRESTED FOR CRYPTOCURRENCY SCHEMEMcAfee and his bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr were charged for a scheme to exploit offerings and digital tokens that they later sold once prices rose on the promotions, according to the US Department of Justice and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.But a week before his death, McAfee tweeted that he no digital currency assets squirrelled away.He said: ""The US believes I have hidden crypto. I wish I did but it has dissolved through the many hands of Team McAfee (your belief is not required), and my remaining assets are all seized. ""My friends evaporated through fear of association. I have nothing. Yet, I regret nothing.""MULTIPLE INQUIRIES INTO A MAN ON THE RUN Ae well as facing tax evasion charges in the US, authorities in Belize sought to question him over the bloody death of a neighbor who threatened his dogs.McAfee had lived on the run, living on a boat in international waters before he was arrested in October 2020 while trying to leave Spain for Turkey.MCAFEE SAID THE GOVERNMENT WAS AFTER HIM For years, McAfee claimed that he was being targeted as he alleged that he had compiled files about ""corruption"" in governments.He said that he had been receiving ""subtle messages"" from US officials threatening him.The entrepreneur had also previously compared himself to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as he claimed that he would never die by suicide.Epstein was also found dead in a prison cell in 2019.“If I hang myself, a la Epstein, it will be no fault of mine,"" He also showed off a tattoo on his arm reading ""whackd"" as he claimed again that he would never kill himself.EX-WIFE CLAIMS AUTHORITIES WERE 'DETERMINED' MCAFEE WOULD DIEOnly three days before his death,  authorities were ""determined"" he would die in prison in a chilling Father's Day message.""John’s honesty has often gotten him in trouble with corrupt governments and corrupt government officials because of his outspoken nature and his refusal to be extorted, intimidated, or silenced,"" she said.""Now the US authorities are determined to have John in prison to make an example of him for speaking out against corruption within their government agencies.""MCAFEE PLANNED ON FIGHTING CHARGESSpain’s National Court on Monday ruled that McAfee should be extradited to the US to face charges for evading more than $4million in the fiscal years 2014 to 2018.The judge dropped seven of the 10 counts in the initial indictment.Villalba said that McAfee had learned about the ruling shortly after on Monday and that his death on Wednesday didn’t come in the heat of the moment.He also said that the legal team had been preparing an appeal to avoid being extradited.MCAFEE'S LAWYER BLAMES 'THE CRUELTY OF THE SYSTEM' FOR DEATHAlthough Villalba said that he had no evidence of any foul play, he blamed the death on ""the cruelty of the system"" for keeping a 75-year-old behind bars for economic and not blood-related crimes after judges refused to release him on bail.""We had managed to nullify seven of the 10 counts he was accused of and even so he was still that dangerous person who could be fleeing Spain if he was released?"" the lawyer said.""He was a world eminence, where could he hide?""MCAFEE'S LAWYER SAID THEY WILL GET 'TO THE BOTTOM' OF MYSTERIOUS DEATH Lawyer Javier Villalba said the entrepreneur’s death came as a surprise to his wife and other relatives, adding he would seek to get “to the bottom” of his client’s death.It also comes as it emerges that while McAfee had been sharing a jail cell in the prison since he was placed in preventative detention since his October arrest, he was reportedly alone at the time of his death, AP reports.A judge has ordered an autopsy for McAfee to determine the cause of death but a court spokeswoman for the Catalonia region said Thursday that it could take ""days or weeks.""""This has been like pouring cold water on the family and on his defense team,"" Villalba told The Associated Press on Thursday.""Nobody expected it, he had not said goodbye.""MCAFEE COULD HAVE FACED A 30-YEAR SENTENCEThe pioneering creator of popular computer antivirus software died in an apparent suicide yesterday afternoon at Brians 2 Prison in Barcelona on the day that a court approved his extradition to the US on tax evasion charges. If  he faced a maximum 30-year sentence.His cousin's comments on the ""shock"" of his death come as McAfee's lawyer claims that he ""didn't say goodbye to his family"" before his reported suicide.MCAFEE'S RELATIVES SAY: 'I WOULDN'T KNOW WHY HE DIED' Shelley Uden and her brother Gary Williams, from Gloucestershire in the UK, are cousins of the late tech entrepreneur John McAfee. Their late father and John’s mother were brother and sister.Gary’s wife Ruth Williams told The Sun: “I wouldn't know why he died or if it was a suicide or a suspicious death by the authorities trying to shut him up.“My husband hadn’t seen him in years and I’d never met him.""was renowned for his eccentric behavior and trouble with the law.MCAFEE'S FAMILY QUESTIONS LEGITIMACY OF SUICIDE questioned his death by suicide as they referenced his own previous claims of ""authorities trying to shut him up.""Shelley Uden said on Thursday she was ""very sad"" to hear of her cousin's death, adding ""if he did take his own life, we may never know why.”Shelley, 70, who lives with husband John in Gwent, Wales, told The Sun that she ""heard about his death in prison on the main news last night.""""It came as quite a shock,"" she said.“He was a very colorful character. I lost contact with him years ago and while I never saw him I heard about him on the news.”DRUG USEHe took on a series of programming jobs instead — but soon developed a love of drugs, particularly LSD. According to Wired, he'd drop acid in the morning before heading off to work.On one harrowing occasion, McAfee snorted an entire bag of a psychedelic powder called DMT. He was found hiding behind a rubbish bin, convinced he could hear voices.Over the next few years, his drug habit escalated, and McAfee found himself doing lines of cocaine at work most days.Unsurprisingly, things eventually came to a head in the early 1980s when his wife left him and he was sacked.CRYPTIC 'Q' POST ON MCAFEE'S INSTAGRAM BEFORE ACCOUNT WAS DELETED ahead of his extradition to the United States, and 30 minutes after news of his death broke, McAfee's .However, less than 24 hours after his death, McAfee's Instagram page appeared to be deleted.And the ""Q"" photo on his social media appears to be a reference to QANON, the bizarre conspiracy theory that was tied to the fortunes of former President Donald Trump.McAfee's latest Instagram post was shared without a caption and showed a black letter ""Q"" on top of a white background, the Independent reported.The letter ""Q"" represents a disproven and discredited far-right conspiracy theory, known as QANON, about pedophiles running a worldwide child sex-trafficking ring.Instagram users responded to the post by commenting: ""RIP,""""this man did not kill himself,"" ""Q,"" and ""Epstein 2.0""According to the news outlet, McAfee once shared a photo in 2019 of himself in an altered image of Jeffrey Epstein — who was found dead in a prison cell that same year.QUANTUM SUICIDE DEMONSTRATION ON JOURNALISTTech writer Joshua Davis visited McAfee at his island estate in Belize, where he was hunkered down at the time after being accused of assembling a private army to enter the drug trade.The interview took a dark turn when the millionaire produced a gun and asked: ""Can I do a demonstration?"".Davis claims in the story that McAfee loaded a bullet into the Smith and Wesson revolver and then proceeded to point the gun at his head.Staring at the journalist, he then repeatedly pulled the trigger in a solo game of Russian Roulette - counting down all the five chambers in the gun.But the pistol never went off, and McAfee said: ""I can do this all day long.""I can do this ten thousand times. Nothing will ever happen. Why? Because you have missed something.""You are operating on an assumption about reality that is wrong.""MCAFEE FASCINATED WITH 'PAINLESS' SUICIDEWeeks before his death he tweeted about being asked by a man ""facing a difficult situation"" about ""painless ways"" to kill himself.He added: ""The amazing thing is that the tone of the discussion was like discussing the weather"".But perhaps one of the most out there theories on his death being dredged up by fans is the antivirus boss's apparent fascination with ""quantum suicide"".""Quantum suicide"" is a theoretical thought experiment which is based on the idea there are an infinite amount of parallel universes.The mind bending theory goes that every decision creates a different universe, according to the basis of quantum mechanics.So the outlandish conceptual experiment claims if this is all true - you should be able to stand in front of loaded gun and survive.This is because your consciousness only continues in the parallel universe in which you survive - thus proving we have ""quantum immortality"".Quantum suicide however is only an abstract thought experiment - and would not work in the real world - and it used mainly as a concept to help distinguish between different theories of quantum mechanics.McAfee however appears to have been intrigued by the idea.MCAFEE PLEDGED TO EAT HIS OWN 'MANHOOD' IF BITCOIN DIDN'T REACH $500K BY THE END OF 2020In November 2017 he wrote: “When I predicted Bitcoin at $500,000 by the end of 2020, it used a model that predicted $5,000 at the end of 2017.“BTC has accelerated much faster than my model assumptions. I now predict Bircoin [sic] at $1 million by the end of 2020. I will still eat my d*** if wrong.”Thay year he was asked by a twitter user: ""So 1btc 500k $ within 3 years?"" and he replied: ""If not, I will eat my d*** on national television.""But then seeming to go back on his word in 2020 he then wrote: ""Eat my d*** in 12 months? A ruse to onboard new users. It worked.MCAFEE SPOKE OF 12 SUSPECTED ATTACKS ON HIS LIFEMcAfee later told a Gizmodo journalist of about 12 suspected attempts on his life - a paranoia possibly fuelled his erratic drug-taking.Finally, after a neighbor he argued with was found dead in a pool of his own blood with a gunshot wound to his head, McAfee fled the country.ANTIBIOTICS COMPANY IN BELIZEAlthough it was meant to be an escape from business, he ended up starting an antibiotics company within a few months of moving there.At some point during this time he began posting on drug-taking message boards about attempts to purify the compounds within bath salts.But his business venture turned to ruin when local cops raided the property in search of evidence of drug-making.They found a cache of weapons, £15,000 in cash and some legal drug-making equipment, shot a dog, handcuffed four security guards and arrested McAfee - but they found nothing to pin on him.AEROTREKKING INCIDENT 'KILLED HIS NEPHEW'It also helped him indulge his hobby of aerotrekking - flying unlicensed microlight aircraft at low altitude and breakneck speeds.Having gained a harem of female followers at a sex yoga ashram he established, according to Vice, McAfee then used fake social media accounts to try to boost the sport's popularity.But, entangled in a lawsuit over a flying accident which killed his nephew, the increasingly wacky McAfee fed the press stories about being wiped out by the financial crisis 2007-08, sold all his property at bargain prices and headed for the Central American jungle.'HEDONISTIC LIFESTYLE'The millions he made from the sale of his stake in McAfee Associates, a revolutionary computer antivirus company, allowed him to enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle.The money funded an opulent playboy existence which included buying homes in Hawaii, Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico.WHERE WAS MCAFEE FROM?Having been born on a US Army base in the UK, McAfee had both American and British citizenship.He was born in Gloucestershire, England, and raised in Virginia.REFUGE IN LONDON AND PARISDays later he claimed to have sought refuge in London and Paris.McAfee tweeted a picture claiming that he and his wife, Janice McAfee were sitting in a London restaurant.He then wrote: ""On the move again. The long arm of the U.S. is reaching for us here in London.""Thank God it's a weekend. Government bureaucracy paperwork is stalled until tomorrow morning.""We are never stalled. Will update you soon.""Four hours later, in a tweet he had stamped as having been sent from Paris, he posted pictures of himself and his wife with two other men in a hotel room, and wrote: ""The bad guys never came close.""We are out of England now and on our way to complete safety.""His location at the time that any of the tweets were published were not independently verified.SUSPECTED OF BEING ON YACHT WITH 'HIGH-CALIBER WEAPONS'In January 2019, McAfee claimed to be living internationally on a boat.Later that year, in July, he was released from detention in the Dominican Republic after he and five others were suspected of traveling on a yacht carrying high-caliber weapons, ammunition and military-style gear.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Malta and Balearic Islands added to UK’s green travel list - Evening Standard
alta and The Balearic Islands - that include popular holiday destinations Ibiza, Mallorca, and Menorca- are among country’s that have been added to the UK’s green list for travel.It means that travellers returning from the destinations will no longer need to quarantine. The changes will come into effect from 4am on Wednesday, June 30.Madeira, the Balearic Islands, several UK Overseas Territories and Caribbean Islands including Barbados will also to the green list and green watchlist, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.He also announed it is the Government’s intention that “later in the summer” UK residents who are fully vaccinated will not have to isolate when travelling from amber list countries, adding that further details will be set out next month.He said: “We’re moving forward with efforts to safely reopen international travel this summer, and thanks to the success of our vaccination programme, we’re now able to consider removing the quarantine period for fully vaccinated UK arrivals from amber countries – showing a real sign of progress.“It’s right that we continue with this cautious approach, to protect public health and the vaccine rollout as our top priority, while ensuring that our route out of the international travel restrictions is sustainable.”The Department for Transport said on its website: “In recognition of our successful domestic vaccination programme, and as part of the Global Travel Taskforce’s checkpoint review, our intention is that later in the summer, arrivals who are fully vaccinated will not have to quarantine when travelling from amber list countries.“We expect this to occur in phases, starting with UK residents. They will still be required to take a pre-departure test and a test on Day 2, and any positive results will be sequenced to continue to manage the risk of importing variants.“At the same time, we intend to remove the guidance that people should not travel to amber countries. Pending decisions on whether under-18s should routinely be offered vaccination, we will also take clinical advice on whether regular testing can provide a safe alternative to quarantine for children accompanied by vaccinated adults.“Further detail will be set out next month including the rules which will apply to children and those unable to be vaccinated, how we will operationalise this approach at the border, and the dates on which these changes will come into effect.”Eritrea, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Mongolia, Tunisia and Uganda will be added to the red list.Shai Weiss, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the expanded travel green list did not “go far enough”.“The Government’s own evidence shows that the US is low risk and should be added to the green list now,” he added.“Whilst the transatlantic corridor is closed, £23 million in economic value each day is restricted. We urge the UK Government to move the US to the UK’s ‘green list’ and for the Biden administration to repeal the 212F proclamation for UK travellers.”Airport Operators Association chief executive Karen Dee said: “Any extension of the green list is welcome, however small, but we also have to be realistic: this is not yet the meaningful restart the aviation industry needs to be able to recover from the pandemic.”She said more more detail was needed from the government about its plans and demanded “significant sector-specific support” for the aviation industry.Rory Boland, Which? travel editor, said travellers still needed to be “extremely cautious” about booking trips abroad.He said: “Countries can be downgraded quickly and with little warning, as we saw with Portugal, while several European countries have introduced quarantine requirements for UK residents.”The government updated its traffic light system and latest travel advice amid calls from holidaymakers and travel firms for more countries to be moved from the amber list.Boris Johnson said on Thursday there is a “real opportunity” to ease travel restrictions for fully vaccinated people amid calls for self-isolation rules to be dropped for those who have been fully-vaccinated.On the prospect of taking his own holiday abroad this summer, Mr Johnson said his plans are “at the unformed stage”, adding: “I’m certainly not ruling it in or ruling it out.”However, those hoping to book a late summer getaway could face another obstacle - with German Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for travellers from the UK to be quarantined wherever they arrive in the EU, due to growing fears over the spread of the Delta variant.“In our country, if you come from Great Britain, you have to go into quarantine - and that’s not the case in every European country, and that’s what I would like to see,” she told the Bundestag lower house of parliament.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
