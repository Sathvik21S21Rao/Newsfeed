We’re sorry, this service is currently unavailable. Please try again later.For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, Singapore: Indonesia has been urged to try to buy any excess AstraZeneca vaccines from Australia amid a worsening COVID-19 crisis that is being compared with India’s outbreak.With major hospitals and morgues filled as the Delta strain surges in the world’s fourth most populous country, Indonesia President Joko Widodo has outlined ambitious new vaccination targets as his government tightens restrictions on movement on Java and Bali.Indonesia is ramping up its vaccination program but does not yet have enough to inoculate its 270 million people. Credit:AP But as adequate supply remains elusive, Indonesian medics are asking if the nation can get access to unwanted AstraZeneca from Australia, which has grown increasingly ambivalent about the Anglo-Swedish vaccine.Dr Erlina Burhan, the spokeswoman for COVID-19 from the Indonesian Medical Association, said Indonesia’s health ministry and state-owned vaccine producer PT Bio Farma should procure any unwanted doses from the 50 million being produced by Australian biotech company CSL.“The health ministry should buy them,” she told The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. “They should want it because we are in need of vaccines.”Indonesia has so far delivered 42 million shots to its population but, as the nation faces the enormous task of inoculating at least two-thirds of its 270 million people, Joko wants 80 million doses delivered a month by October.Indonesia Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin said on Thursday that Australia had donated $77 million to Indonesia for the purchase of vaccines through the COVAX scheme and he hoped to use it to buy 10 million doses.“The health ministry should buy them. They should want it because we are in need of vaccines.”He said Sinovac had already provided the country with raw materials for 105 million doses of the Chinese vaccine. He expects more doses of AstraZeneca to arrive via the COVAX facility, having received only 8.2 million shots so far via the World Health Organisation-backed program. A Pfizer delivery is due in August, along with 4 million Moderna doses from the US.Australia has  and, as of last week, had already donated 360,000 to Pacific nations and East Timor. A quarter of the 1 million doses pledged to Fiji, which is battling its own outbreak, have already been shipped.There has also been a promise of 1 billion shots to ASEAN countries from the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue group, which is made up of Australia, the United States, Japan and India. Japan announced this week that, despite its own outbreak on the brink of the Olympics, it was donating 2 million doses of AstraZenenca to Indonesia and 1 million each to Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. The US is also sending 1 million doses of Pfizer to Malaysia and the Philippines this month.Australia is providing a $101.9 million package to support Indonesia’s national vaccines program.“Australia has committed $100 million to the Quad Vaccine Partnership which will assist with delivery support for south-east Asia,” a spokesman for Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. DFAT estimates that Australia’s $130 million contribution will help COVAX deliver more than 1.8 billion doses.“This support is complemented by Australia’s commitment to share at least 20 million additional doses for the Indo-Pacific region by mid-2022.”“Within two weeks, Indonesia’s situation is beginning to resemble India,” Dr Faheem Younus, Chief of Infectious Diseases at the University of Maryland, warned on Thursday, following on from a Red Cross alert that the country was “on the edge of a COVID-19 catastrophe”.On the same day as another new national record of 24,836 new infections on Thursday and a record daily death toll of 504, the WHO’s latest situation report made for dire reading.It said the intensive care wards in two major centres for COVID-19 treatment – the Cengkareng Hospital in the west of Jakarta and Bekasi City Hospital in West Java, were at full capacity. Local media reported that bed occupancy in Surabaya, the second biggest city, was also at its limit, including in field hospitals.Worryingly, only 21 per cent of older people have at least one vaccine dose and just 12 per cent have been fully inoculated. Many health workers – including 6000 in Aceh and 5000 in Papua – have not had a jab at all, said the WHO. Testing rates remain below par across most provinces.The World Health Organisation warns the emergency rooms and even morgues are now at capacity in some parts of Indonesia. Credit:AP Indonesia, which has reported 58,995 deaths to the virus, will now impose long-awaited lockdown measures across Java and Bali from Saturday until July 20. Malls and mosques will close and mask wearing is now mandatory. Those who can work from home must do so. While he hopes it will push new cases back under 10,000 a day and prevent the health system from collapsing, Joko knows vaccination is the path out of the pandemic and has raised the benchmark.“Until yesterday, the Covid-19 vaccination in Indonesia had reached 42 million doses,” he tweeted on Thursday.“Our target this month is 34 million doses, August 43.7 million, September 53 million, October 84 million, November 80.9 million, and December 71.7 million.“With hard work, this target is not difficult as long as there is a vaccine.”Get a note direct from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world. .",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.126%2C$multiply_0.4431%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/4c94d67093313b57d3c82d193043529cf6b5e6b8,"Miami apartment building collapse death toll climbs to 18 as rescuers find six more bodies - ABC News

Vancouver/Portland: A heatwave that smashed all-time high temperature records in western Canada and the US north-west has left a rising death toll in its wake as officials brace for more sizzling weather and the threat of wildfires.The worst of the heat had passed by on Wednesday (US/Canada time), but the state of Oregon reported 63 deaths linked to the heatwave. Multnomah County, which includes Portland, reported 45 of those deaths since Friday, with the county Medical Examiner citing hyperthermia as the preliminary cause.Kais Bothe relaxes in the cool in the city hall pool, as temperatures hit 37 degrees in Edmonton, Alberta, on Wednesday. APBy comparison all of Oregon had only 12 deaths from hyperthermia from 2017 to 2019, the statement said. Across the state, hospitals reported a surge of hundreds of visits in recent days due to heat-related illness, the Oregon Health Authority said.In British Columbia, at least 486 sudden deaths were reported over five days, nearly three times the usual number that would occur in the province over that period, the B.C. Coroners Service said on Wednesday.“This was a true health crisis that has underscored how deadly an extreme heat wave can be,” Multnomah County health officer Dr Jennifer Vines said in the statement. “As our summers continue to get warmer, I suspect we will face this kind of event again.”A Salvation Army vehicle is setup as a cooling station as people line up to get into a splash park to beat the heat in Calgary, Alberta. APThe heat dome, a weather phenomenon trapping heat and blocking other weather systems from moving in, weakened as it moved east, but was still intense enough to set records from Alberta to Manitoba, said David Phillips, senior climatologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada, a government agency.“In some of these places, their [temperature] records are being annihilated,” Phillips said. “It really is spectacular, unprecedented for us.”It was unclear what triggered the dome, but climate change looks to be a contributor, given the heatwave’s duration and extremes, Phillips said.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau paused to remember the dead during remarks in Ottawa on Wednesday and expressed concern over the fire threat.“We’ve been seeing more and more of this type of extreme weather event in the past years,” Trudeau said. “So realistically, we know that this heatwave won’t be the last.”In Washington, US President Joe Biden said climate change was driving “a dangerous confluence of extreme heat and prolonged drought,” warning that the United States was behind in preparing for what could be a record number of forest fires this year.Lytton, a town in central British Columbia, this week broke Canada’s all-time hottest temperature record three times. It stands at 49.6 degrees (121.28 degrees Fahrenheit) as of Tuesday. The previous high in Canada, known for brutally cold winters, was 45 degrees, set in Saskatchewan in 1937.In the US north-west, temperatures in Washington and Oregon soared well above 38 degrees over the weekend. Portland set all-time highs several days in a row including 47 degrees on Sunday.In Washington state, where media also reported a surge in heat-related hospitalizations, Chelan County east of Seattle topped out at 48 degrees on Tuesday.Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a state of emergency due to “imminent threat of wildfires” while the U.S. National Weather Service in Portland issued a red-flag warning for parts of the state, saying wind conditions could spread fire quickly.The Portland Fire Department banned use of fireworks for the Fourth of July weekend, when Americans celebrate Independence Day.Most of Alberta and large parts of British Columbia and Saskatchewan are at extreme risk of wildfires, according to Natural Resources Canada’s fire weather map.“All the ingredients are there. It’s a powder keg just looking for a spark,” said Mike Flannigan, professor of wildland fire at University of Alberta.But the Chilcotin region, roughly 600 kilometres north of Vancouver, was on flood warning due to the “unprecedented” amount of snow melting at “extraordinary” rates, according to a government release.“These are the types of issues that are going to be confronted more and more over the next few years,” said Adam Rysanek, assistant professor of environmental systems at the University of British Columbia.Reuters ",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg

Following the temporary suspension of Bharat Biotech’s deal with Brazil for 20 million doses of the Covaxin Covid vaccine, the pharmaceutical company has clarified that it had not received any payment from the Government of Brazil so far.“As of 29th June 2021, Bharat Biotech has not received any advance payments nor supplied any vaccines to Ministry of Health Brazil,” the company statement reads.Regarding the pricing of the doses, the company said, “The pricing of Covaxin has been clearly established between $15-20 per dose for supplies to governments outside India. The pricing for Brazil has also been indicated at $15 per dose,” news agency PTI reported.It added that Bharat Biotech followed a “step-by-step approach” towards contracts and regulatory approvals in an eight-month-long process. “A similar approach towards contracts, regulatory approvals and supplies in several countries worldwide, where Covaxin is being supplied successfully,” the company said in the statement.Bharat Biotech had received emergency use approval in Brazil on June 4, after the National Health Surveillance Agency of Brazil- Anvisa, allowed import of the Covid vaccine with certain conditions.On Wednesday, Brazil Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga announced that the company had temporarily suspended its deal with the Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical company following allegations of irregularities in the deal.“According to CGU’s preliminary analysis, there are no irregularities in the contract, but, due to compliance, the @minsaude opted to suspend the contract for further analysis,” the health minister tweeted.Stating that the decision does not impact Brazil’s vaccination drive, Queiroga added, “It is noteworthy that the @govbr did not pay ANY CENT for the Covaxin vaccine.”Earlier, two  blamed President Jair Bolsonaro and his powerful coalition chief for agreeing to buy the Indian vaccine at a price that was allegedly higher than that of other options available in the market — that too, when it lacked local regulatory approval.In response, the company had stated, “We strongly refute and deny any kind of allegation or implication of any wrongdoing whatsoever with respect to the supply of Covaxin.” The company also said that Madison Biotech was its global sales and marketing unit, Reuters reported.With inputs from agencies",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Ebrahim Raisi’s election represents a return to ideological moorings of 1979 Iranian revolution - The Indian Express
The election of Ebrahim Raisi to the presidency in Iran will be widely viewed as a victory for the Supreme Leader of the Revolution, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In the eyes of many Iranian and international observers, it was nothing but an engineered selection by the Guardian Council, a 12-member body of jurists and clerics that is closely aligned with the office of the Supreme Leader. The Guardian Council’s decision to disqualify many well-known figures of the Iranian political establishment, like former Speaker of the Parliament Ali Larijani, and twice President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, came as a surprise to the Iranian voters and some political elites. None of Raisi’s vetted rivals, including the former head of Iran’s central bank, Abdolnaser Hemmati, represented a real threat to his candidacy and final election. According to the figures released by Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli on June 19, the voter turnout was 48.8 per cent, the lowest in a presidential election since 1979.The election of Raisi as Iran’s new president marks the beginning of a new chapter in the country’s domestic and foreign policies. A hardliner, Raisi’s main challenge will be to protect and sustain the ideological framework of the 1979 Islamic Revolution while trying to respond to the general needs of the larger part of the Iranian population that suffers daily because of the regime’s political mismanagement and economic corruption. Though he has the full support of Ayatollah Khamenei and the military institutions, the new president will face difficulties in persuading his fellow Iranians to toe his line. Despite his relations with the Iranian judiciary, from being a member of a committee that ordered the execution of political activists in the 1980s to holding the offices of deputy chief justice, attorney general, and chief justice, Raisi is a cleric with very little experience of either politics or management.On domestic policies, Raisi will certainly operate from a position of strength, especially now that the Iranian reform movement has been marginalised. Instead, he will sustain Iran’s revolutionary image and its Islamic values by confronting any opposition from the Iranian civil society or the so-called “moderates” of the Islamic regime. Last but not the least, following Ayatollah Khamenei’s political goal, the politically influential posts in Raisi’s cabinet will be held by loyal hardliners and some of the veterans of the IRGC: Raisi is expected to pick Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei, a hardline cleric linked to the intelligence ministry, Alireza Zakani, the former secretary-general of the Alliance of Wayfarers of the Islamic Revolution, Mahmoud Nabavian, a cleric who has been a critic of Iran’s nuclear negotiations, and Parviz Fattah, who was director of IRGC’s Cooperative Foundation. One way or another, Raisi’s choices will have to fit into a framework of Ayatollah Khamenei and IRGC’s vision of an Islamic revolution and government.That said, it will be interesting to see how the Iranian people and the international community react to the political and economic policies of a cleric, who for more than three decades has been the instrument of Iran’s unelected deep state. Based on Raisi’s background and his previous statements, his presidency is likely to be ultraconservative but shunning adventurism. Raisi’s government is unlikely to be more successful than that of Hassan Rouhani in trying to resolve Iran’s difficulties with the United States and Europe in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Lebanon. The new president knows well that he will not be able to restore the regime’s popular legitimacy, but Raisi will try to deliver tangible improvement in governance in order to prevent the ship from sinking.This column first appeared in the print edition on June 30, 2021 under the title ‘New Face, Old Idea’.

"Thousands gather in Tiananmen Square to celebrate centenary of Chinese Communist Party - The Straits Times
BEIJING - In the summer, the sun rises early in Beijing, so when the crowd piled into spectator stands on Tiananmen Square in the wee hours of Thursday (July 1) morning, it was already bright.Some 70,000 spectators had gathered in the heart of the Chinese capital to celebrate the centenary of China's ruling party.The festivities began with a mass singing of communist songs - which included tunes like “Without the Communist Party, there will be no New China” and “Socialism is good” – exhorting the people to be loyal to and keep faith with the party.The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was founded in 1921, turns 100 this year. In the run up to the anniversary, the party has been drawing attention to its achievements, including its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19 and the eradication of absolute poverty.On Thursday morning, the party once more sought to drive home the message of its supremacy over Covid-19, telling spectators - who had entered the square masked - to remove their face masks just before the festivities.For weeks, the CCP had kept details of its anniversary celebrations under wraps, all that was known was that party leader and Chinese President Xi Jinping would give a speech at the celebration on Thursday morning.Dressed in a Mao suit, Mr Xi took to the podium and in a 70-minute speech  pointing to how the CCP had led China from when it was a nation where “people could not keep warm and their bellies full, till its ‘moderately prosperous’ status” today.“In order to realise the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the CCP united and led the Chinese people through bloody battles, and proved to be indomitable,” he said.About 20 minutes into Mr Xi’s speech, a light drizzle started that gave way into a steady downpour. Parts of it was drowned out by many reaching for their ponchos.Mr Xi also sounded a warning against external forces that would try to “bully” or pressure China.“Whoever wants to do this will smash their heads bloody against the Great Wall of steel formed by the blood of 1.4 billion Chinese people,” he said, to cheers from spectators.The celebration was attended by top Chinese leadership including former president Hu Jintao. Television images did not appear to show former president Jiang Zemin in attendance.Most of the celebration was taken up by Mr Xi’s speech, but before that, the party also took the chance to show off its latest air force hardware in a fly past involving its J-20 stealth fighter and Z-8 heavy lift helicopter, which flew past carrying the party flag and four banners containing slogans.Other helicopter and jet formations streaked past the crowds forming the numbers “100” and “71”, representing the date - July 1.Nevermind that the actual date of the CCP’s first party congress was on July 23.At the end of the programme, the party released thousands of pigeons and balloons into the sky.

State news agency Xinhua had reported earlier that more than 14,000 people have been involved in rehearsals of the centenary parade.In the run-up to the party's big day, security had been tightened in and around the Tiananmen Square area.Schools and subway stations have been shut since earlier this week and residents in the vicinity, including near the Wangfujing shopping belt, have been told to remain at home until after the festivities end on Thursday.Tiananmen Square, a popular tourist spot, had also been sealed off last week.Choir from Beihang University doing a little cheer for a video. “We’re the combined choir from Beihang University.

JAKARTA: The Indonesian government has unveiled broad emergency community restrictions on Thursday (Jul 1) for the islands of Java and Bali, as the country battles a spike in COVID-19 infections.Under the PPKM (community-level public activity restrictions enforcement) Emergency which will be implemented from Jul 3 to Jul 20, all malls will have to be shut while dining-in will be banned.In a televised statement, Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan said that the restrictions must be enforced as the country has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases of about 230 per cent since the end of May. ""I believe our preparation (for the PPKM Emergency) is the most maximum,"" said Mr Pandjaitan.""So now we must implement it firmly and measuredly.""The minister said that restaurants, cafes and street food vendors can only serve customers for take-aways.  He also said that people's movements will be restricted according to the sectors that they work in. There are three different categories, namely non-essential, essential and critical sectors.All employees in the critical sectors can work in the office. These sectors includes energy, health, security, logistics and transportation, food industry, petrochemical as well as utilities among others that supply basic daily needs.Those in the essential sectors can work in the office with a maximum capacity of 50 per cent and under strict health protocols. These sectors include finance and banking, payment systems, information and communication technology, hotels that do not handle COVID-19 patients as well as export industries.Meanwhile, all employees in the non-essential sectors must work from home.Grocery stores, supermarkets, minimarkets, and wet markets can be operational until 8pm with a capacity of 50 per cent, while pharmacies can operate for 24 hours. All students must study from home. Places of worship, sports facilities, and public facilities such as parks must shut.Wedding receptions can be held with a maximum of 30 people and no dining-in, while public transport may operate with a maximum of 70 per cent capacity. People who want to travel by plane, bus or train must at least be vaccinated once and present their vaccination card. They must also have a negative PCR test that is taken two days prior to boarding a flight.

Indonesia has been grappling with a spike in COVID-19 cases after the Idul Fitri holiday in mid-May.While the spike in cases has been seen in many provinces, the new PPKM Emergency will only be enforced in Java and Bali where many areas have been classified as level 3 or 4. Authorities have classified regions in Indonesia into four levels with level 1 being the safest and level 4 showing the highest levels of transmission. The levels are determined by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines that 50 confirmed cases daily per 100,000 people would be considered level 4. There are 48 regencies or cities in Java and Bali which are classified as level 4. Seventy-four regencies and cities are classified as level 3, according to the government.As of Thursday, Indonesia recorded 2,203,108 cases and 58,995 deaths.The new curbs are stricter than current regulations which allow malls to operate until 8pm, while restaurants are allowed to serve diners at up to 25 per cent of their capacity. Since Indonesia announced its first COVID-19 cases in early March last year, the government has opted against total lockdowns at the national level that would bar people from freely leaving their homes.In late March last year, president Joko Widodo signed a regulation for cities and provinces to enforce large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) under which non-essential workers must work from home, students had to study at home and places of worship were closed. PSBB curbs were relaxed earlier this year and PPKM was introduced, which allows local leaders to restrict movement within their communities. PPKM is currently in force in all 34 provinces.Indonesia is currently battling a new wave of COVID-19 infections and logged a record 24,836 new cases on Thursday as well as 504 deaths. The hike in cases is predicted to continue until at least the beginning of July as previous holidays tended to result in a spike of infections up to seven weeks. ",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Hong Kong silenced as China celebrates Chinese Communist Party centenary - CNA
HONG KONG: Police were out in force across Hong Kong on Thursday (Jul 1), ready to stamp down on any sign of dissent as China's Communist Party celebrated its centenary, in a vivid illustration of how the once-outspoken finance hub has been muzzled.The grand celebrations in Beijing coincided with the 24th anniversary of Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China by colonial Britain.Since 2003, Hong Kong residents have regularly filled the streets each handover anniversary with marches and rallies.But protest has been all but banned in Hong Kong as China carries out a sweeping crackdown against its opponents after huge and often violent rallies convulsed the city two years ago.More than 10,000 officers - one-third of the city's force - were deployed to prevent any public gatherings, local media reported, as officials warned that any attempt to protest would lead to arrest.With Hong Kong's chief executive Carrie Lam attending the festivities in Beijing, her deputy John Lee oversaw a flag-raising ceremony in an exhibition centre as police and water cannon trucks patrolled streets nearby.Lee delivered a speech praising China's imposition of a sweeping national security law in Hong Kong which came into effect just an hour before last year's handover anniversary.""While safeguarding national security, residents continue to enjoy freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom of assembly and demonstration and others according to the law,"" Lee said.

Such assurances are repeatedly made by Hong Kong's leaders but reflect little of the city's current reality.POLICE STATE?Over the last year the national security law has criminalised a host of political views and transformed semi-autonomous Hong Kong's political and legal landscape.Protest has been effectively outlawed, and many of the city's opposition leaders are arrested, jailed or fled overseas.Last month the city's most outspoken pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily shut down after its accounts were frozen under the national security law and multiple employees were arrested over articles the popular tabloid published.Public gatherings of more than four people remain outlawed under anti-coronavirus measures, although the city currently has no active local outbreak.""This is persecution as well as privilege,"" she said in a message released via her lawyers. ""Arresting me won't succeed in shutting up everyone else.""The only visible protest on Thursday morning was carried out by four activists from the League of Social Democrats, one of the few opposition parties still operating.They held a banner near the official reception calling for the release of political prisoners.

About 200 police officers followed their lonely march and stopped the group getting too close to the exhibition centre where dignitaries were gathered.""Police are acting as if they are facing some enormous enemy,"" Raphael Wong, one of the activists, told reporters.""It prompts the question of whether Hong Kong has indeed fallen into a police state. But we will continue to voice out and defend our last space for free speech.""After the ceremony, civil service chief Patrick Nip was asked by a reporter whether he believed Hong Kong could now be described as a police state.""I think that's an overstatement,"" he replied.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Trump Organization, CFO expected to be charged Thursday: Report - CNA
NEW YORK: Former US President Donald Trump's namesake company and its chief financial officer are expected to be hit with criminal charges on Thursday (Jul 1) by prosecutors in Manhattan, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Charges by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance are expected to focus on whether Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg and other officials received perks and benefits such as rent-free apartments and leased cars without reporting them properly on their tax returns, people familiar with the probe have said.The person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Weisselberg and the company are expected to be arraigned on an indictment on Thursday.Weisselberg is expected to turn himself in to authorities on Thursday morning, CNN reported, citing unnamed sources.Trump's lawyer, Ronald Fischetti, told Reuters on Monday that prosecutors suggested the charges would be related to taxes and fringe benefits and that Trump himself would not be charged in the indictment.""This will be their first blow,"" Fischetti said of the prosecutors, adding that in a meeting with them last week they said they were still pursuing their investigation.Mary Mulligan, a lawyer for Weisselberg, declined to comment on possible charges. Vance's office also declined to comment. Lawyers for the Trump Organization did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Trump, during a trip on Wednesday to Weslaco, Texas, near the Mexican border to criticise President Joe Biden's immigration policies, did not respond to questions shouted by reporters about the criminal charges.In a statement on Monday, Trump called prosecutors biased and said his company's actions were ""in no way a crime"". The Trump Organization could face fines and other penalties if convicted.Charges also could increase pressure on Weisselberg to cooperate with prosecutors, which he has resisted. Weisselberg is a close Trump confidant, making his cooperation potentially crucial to any future case against the former president.Court filings, public records and subpoenaed documents have shown that Weisselberg and his son Barry have received perks and gifts potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, including many benefits related to real estate.The case could be charged as a scheme by the company to pay people off the books in order to hide assets over many years.One possible charge would be ""scheme to defraud,"" according to New York attorney Marc Scholl, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office.""'Scheme to defraud' is a crime that allows the prosecution to detail a narrative in the indictment describing the criminal conduct and how it originated, no matter how long ago the crime started,"" Scholl said.Vance, a Democrat, has in his nearly three-year investigation examined an array of potential wrongdoing, including whether Trump's company manipulated the value of its real estate to reduce its taxes and secure favorable loan terms.Before entering the White House in 2017, Trump put his company into a trust overseen by his adult sons and Weisselberg, who has maintained tight control over its finances. It is unclear what role Trump now has at the company.The case could also complicate Trump's political future, as he flirts with a possible 2024 White House run.Jennifer Weisselberg, the former wife of Barry Weisselberg, has met with prosecutors half a dozen times.Her lawyer, Duncan Levin, told Reuters on Wednesday that ""over the past half year, Jen has been cooperating with prosecutors. We have turned over a mountain of evidence to them to support these charges. We're very gratified the DA's office is moving forward with these charges"". In an interview with MSNBC, Jennifer Weisselberg said she would be prepared to testify while adding: ""My documents at this time are witnesses themselves. They are being used, and they're being walked through the grand jury panel.""""We've been going through questions pertaining to compensation, perks and taxes just to review how to ... inform a grand jury,"" she added.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
"Hawaii probe into Lindani Myeni's death concludes cop shooting was justified - TimesLIVE
The Hawaiian police officers who shot dead former SA rugby player Lindani Myeni in Honolulu in April will not be criminally charged for his murder. This was revealed by the island’s authorities in a press conference held on Wednesday.Myeni's wife, Lindsay, said on Facebook this was one of the lowest days in her life.“Regardless of these painful trials, everything is going to be  OK eventually,” she shared. “My worst fear has already come true, there’s nothing more anyone can do to my man. He’s at peace now and that’s still all that matters to me at the end of the day.”HawaiiNewsNow reported that during the conference, prosecutor Steve Alm gave a detailed presentation into investigations conducted by his office which concluded that Myeni’s “shooting was justified”.“The officers who responded to this ended up trying to use multiple non-lethal, non-deadly force methods before they used service firearms,” Alm was quoted as saying.“Officer one was justified in shooting Mr Myeni in self-defence. Officer two was justified in shooting Mr Myeni in defence of another (officer),” he added.Myeni, aged 29, had recently moved to Hawaii with his US-born wife and their two children. Earlier this month, doorbell footage from the holiday home where Myeni was killed was released. The three-minute long footage revealed that Myeni could have possibly been lost and had mistaken this residence for a Hare Krishna temple which was right next to the house.In his presentation, uploaded by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Alm said a woman occupant of the house gave evidence that Myeni had walked into their house, even sitting on a chair in the foyer after telling her that he lived  there and making bizarre statements.“First he said, 'I have videos of you. You know why I’m here.' Puzzled and frightened ... [she] thought Myeni was attempting to extort her.“She asked him to leave several times, threatening to call 911 if he didn’t. She said Myeni responded by saying, 'Tell them I’m from SA. I’m on a hunt. I’m on a safari,' adding 'We’re hunting. There’s no time.'“Myeni commented that he was not afraid of the police and that he would sleep outside.”When police arrived, he refused to comply with police instructions to get on the ground and instead attacked one of the officers.WATCH: During a news conference today, city Prosecutor Steve Alm laid out why his office has concluded the fatal...“Officer three and officer two saw Myeni attack officer one, striking officer one to the head and body area. Myeni said something indiscernible. This assault moved into the front yard ... Officer three yelled, 'Taser! Taser! Taser! Taser!' He drew his Taser, pointed it at Myeni, and deployed one shot, which was ineffective. “Myeni charged at officer three and punched him with closed fists. Myeni continued to attack officer three while he was on the ground. Officer two attempted to take Myeni to the ground but was unsuccessful.“Myeni redirected his attention to officer one. Officer three stood up. Myeni resumed his attack on officer one. Officer one discharged his service firearm once. Myeni took officer one to the ground and repeatedly punched him to the face and head.“As Myeni punched officer one, officer two removed his service firearm, pointed it at Myeni, and commanded him to stop. Officer two discharged his service firearm three times.”While there had been a huge outcry that police had used excessive force on Myeni because he was black, Alm said their investigation could not find any evidence that race played a role in the incident.Alm said Myeni’s stature also played a role in the way police reacted, saying he was much stronger than the police. One of the officers who Myeni had allegedly tackled during their scuffle was said to have sustained a serious concussion. He has not yet returned to work.The Justice for Lindani Myeni group said on Facebook it intended to challenge the prosecution office's decision.“There is much work to be done to secure an independent federal and international investigation,” said the group.TimesLIVE",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Court overturns Bill Cosby sexual assault conviction, orders release - TimesLIVE
Pennsylvania's highest court on Wednesday overturned Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction and ordered that he be released from prison immediately.The decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court came after Cosby had served more than two years of a potential three- to 10-year sentence, following his 2018 conviction.The court found that a previous prosecutor had made a deal with Cosby not to charge him in the case.The comedian and actor was best known for his role as the lovable husband and father in the 1980s television comedy series ""The Cosby Show,"" earning him the nickname ""America's Dad.""But his family-friendly reputation was shattered after dozens of women accused him of sexual assault over a period of decades.

"China's Xi Jinping issues 'bloodshed' warning to foreign powers at Communist Party centenary event - Sky News
It was a long wait for the Party's party. The thousands of people awarded a ticket to Tiananmen Square had left their quarantine hotels at 3am for an 8am start, passing through security check after security check.To pass the time, they sang old red songs - Socialism is Good and other such classics - and practised vigorous flag waving. It's all in the wrist.But cometh hour, cometh the man. Xi Jinping took to the rostrum. All the other leaders on stage were wearing Western business suits.Xi alone was wearing a grey Mao suit.A racket of helicopters approached from the east, in formation to spell out '100'. China's newest stealth jets roared after them.And then the artillery gave a 100-gun salute, the echoes thumping around the corners of Tiananmen in turn.It was an impressive but fairly modest display by the standards of China's vast military.The real star was Xi, the president of China but - much more importantly - the general secretary of the Communist Party. He gave a long speech.Some of it was celebration, some of it justification for a regime that allows no opposition: ""Only socialism can save China, and only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China,"" Xi said.The ideology can be a bit dry but the Party knows which red meat to throw these days, leaning on nationalism as much as Marxism to gee up enthusiasmSo this line prompted the biggest cheer of the day: ""The Chinese people will absolutely not allow any foreign force to bully, oppress or enslave us and anyone who attempts to do so will face broken heads and bloodshed in front of the iron Great Wall of the 1.4 billion Chinese people.""The crowd loved it. And playing those nationalist credentials will be crucial to the Party's future success.But the ceremony was a display of the CCP's remarkable survival. Thousands of people filling Tiananmen Square in neat rows, playing their part.One hundred years ago it was a handful of subversives meeting in secret in Shanghai. They were chased into the mountains and hid out in caves for years.Then triumph in a bloody civil war, and the beginning of uninterrupted one-party rule.That rule has had its catastrophes. The Great Leap Forward led to a famine which killed tens of millions. The terror of the Cultural Revolution followed.And in 1989, in the same square used today for the pageantry of the Party, the Tiananmen student demonstrators asked for greater freedom - and were met with bullets in the surrounding streets.The square still remembers them, even if the Party cares not to.",https://e3.365dm.com/21/07/768x432/skynews-china-communist_5433447.jpg?20210701112421,"Canada US heatwave – live: Town evacuated and hundreds dead as ‘heat dome’ causes record highs - The Independent
Hundreds of people are likely to have died as a result of record-breaking temperatures in Canada and the US Northwest, authorities say.While more than 60 fatalities in the US state of Oregon have been linked to the heat, the Canadian province of British Columbia experienced a 195 per cent increase in sudden deaths.Lisa Lapointe, British Columbia’s chief coroner, said there had been a minimum of 486 “sudden and unexpected deaths” over the five days to Wednesday.This comes after Lytton, a village in the province, recorded the highest-ever temperature in Canada earlier this week, with the mercury reaching 49.6C. It was evacuated on Wednesday, after it became engulfed by a fast-moving wildfire. The temperatures are particularly high due to a phenomenon known as a “heat dome”, which traps hot air and does not allow other weather systems to move in.The risk of wildfires has risen in step with the soaring temperatures, with the governor of Oregon issuing a state of emergency and many parts of Canada under threat.Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau struck a sombre tone on Wednesday. “We’ve been seeing more and more of this type of extreme weather event in the past years.So realistically, we know that this heatwave won’t be the last.”The heatwave in Canada is so intense that it created the conditions for extreme wildfires, which then sparked thunderstorms and lightning, in turn igniting further fires. Daniel Swain, a meteorologist, said this “wildfire-associated pyroconvective event” was in all likelihood the “most extreme” he’d ever seen. The climate activist Greta Thunberg has hit out at media coverage of the North American heatwave which shows beach and swimming pools, rather than focusing on the deaths and wildfires it has caused. The 18 year-old tweeted that some outlets show “happy people on beaches, pools or playing in fountains” and not “the record breaking Canadian town’s on fire”.This comes as one Met Office scientist said that the 49.6C recorded in the Canadian village of Lytton on Tuesday “would have been almost impossible” without human-driven climate change.This temperature would be a natural phenomenon “once every tens of thousands of years”, they added.Loading....Wildfires are sweeping across Canada amid a record-breaking heatwave. Here’s a video about the evacuation of the village of Lytton: Wildfires continue to rage in Canada amid a heatwave, with evacuation orders made for several areas - including the village of Lytton - on Wednesday.On Wednesday, the British Columbia Wildfire Service said a fire at McKay Creek fire had scorched 50 square kilometres north of Lillooet, while flames had burned at least 40 square kilometres north of Kamloops. The heatwave in Canada in recent days has been a “wake-up call”, scientists have said. Brett Anderson, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather, told The Independent: “[We] knew that some all-time highs may be in jeopardy of falling, but they did not just get broken, they were obliterated.”Joseph Shea, a professor of environmental geomatics at the University of Northern British Columbia, said the past week should serve a warning. “Our cities and our infrastructure have been designed for a climate that no longer exists,” he explained. For those who missed it yesterday, Ashleigh Stewart has this report from Toronto: Our senior climate correspondent Louise Boyle will be on hand tomorrow to answer readers’ questions on California’s climate emergency.She has recently spent time criss-crossing California speaking to those on the front lines of the fight against wildfires. Her question-and-answer session will be live from 1pm tomorrow.You can find further details here: Many of those who have died in British Columbia (BC) from the heat were elderly people who lived alone in “very warm homes with no ventilation”, the province’s chief coroner has said. From Friday to Wednesday, there were 321 excess deaths in BC, most of which were heat-related, according to Lisa Lapointe. Speaking on Wednesday, Ms Lapointe, said: “Many who died were seniors who lived alone.”She added that because of the high numbers of reported death, there had been delays in coroners’ response time. “We have reallocated resources and are continuing to do everything within our power to minimize wait times,” she said. With wildfires warnings in place across the north-west of the US and Canada, it is a fitting time to assess the scale of the challenge facing firefighters in North America. The Independent travelled across California speaking to emergency responders as well as those whose lives have been turned upside down by wildfires. Six of the state’s largest 20 fires occurred last year, and this trend is likely to continue. Louise Boyle reports: In preparation for another season of intense wildfires, the Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it will employ more federal firefighters and will give them a pay rise.They will receive a minimum of $15 per hour, the White House confirmed.During an online meeting with the governors of Western states, the president said the country was “playing catch-up” in its ability to respond to heatwaves and wildfires.“That’s going to change and we have to do it. We can’t cut corners when it comes to managing our wildfires or supporting our firefighters. Right now we have to act and act fast,” Mr Biden said.“With fire seasons turning into fire years, it is imperative to have a year-round workforce that is available to respond at any time,” the White House added.Satellite imagery taken by NASA measures the air temperatures in portions of the US and Canada on 27 JuneWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The more frugal EU countries, with the support of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are calling for a return to stable fiscal policies. But southern countries in the bloc such as Spain and Italy, as wel as France, are calling for substantial reforms to avoid a return to pre-pandemic rules.Nadia Calviño, Spain’s minister in charge of economic affairs and digitalisation, told Politico the bloc’s rules “were not fit for purpose before the pandemic hit us"".She added: “It would be wise to review these rules before we go back to the normal situation.”Speaking at an event in Lisbon organised by the outgoing Portuguese Council presidency, which also featured Ms Calviño and Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said: “Common debt should be a more permanent tool for investment in Europe, particularly in the climate transition.""With a necessary corollary: member states must respect their commitments in terms of public finances and quality of public spending.""In a nod to frugal countries' reluctance to reform fiscal rules, Mr Le Maire mocked the Dutch at the event.He joked: “I really think that we need [this] kind of meeting.""Next time maybe you could invite the Dutch finance minister, just for the sake of having a little bit of fun among us.""Paolo Gentiloni warned differences between northern and southern states are a risk worth taking in order to reach an agreement.READ MORE: He said: “The risk of differences is there — you could even argue the risk is stronger if you don’t open the debate on the rules.""And the debate is already ongoing, along with preparation from both camps on how to best put their feet down on the issue.Two weeks ago, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz sought to build a team of EU rebel countries that would prevent a softening of the bloc's budget rules when they come under review later this year and in 2022, calling for a stronger focus on reducing public debt.In a letter to EU counterparts, Austrian Finance Minister Gernot Bluemel said the rules had been central to reducing debt-to-GDP ratios across the bloc after the sovereign debt crisis.DON'T MISS: [LIVE BLOG] [REACTION] [INSIGHT]Austria is among a group of EU countries often seen as frugal, along with Sweden, Denmark and Finland, the Netherlands, Germany, the Baltics, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.Mr Bluemel wrote in the letter: ""A key lesson after the financial crisis was the need to reduce high debt ratios and increase fiscal sustainability in order to prepare for unforeseen future events.""The Commission will come up with a review of the economic governance framework in the coming months.""He added some ideas for reforms of the EU's Stability and Growth Pact were presented at a ministerial meeting last month.He continued: ""I am somewhat concerned about some contributions questioning a rules-based framework or diluting the value of sustainability.""Our common objective must be a reduction of debt to GDP ratios over the medium- and long term.""Some senior EU officials said the rules, which have already been revised three times and become increasingly complex, should be simplified and focused on criteria that finance ministers can directly control, like public spending and debt.But others say the rules should promote investment, which is key for growth, and therefore possibly exclude it from calculations of budget deficits, which now cannot be higher than 3 percent of GDP.Some senior officials also say, rather than targeting their debt-to-GDP ratios, governments should focus on debt servicing costs.They argue because interest rates are likely to stay very low for a long time, what a country spends on debt servicing is a better measure of debt sustainability.But Mr Bluemel cautioned against that view.He wrote: ""Even though the current financing environment is undoubtedly favourable and the interest rate-growth differential was negative over the past years before the crisis, there is no guarantee that this will always be the case.""We all have witnessed the economic, social and political costs of swings in market sentiment, when policies and developments were deemed no longer sustainable.""",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg
"Taiwan lashes out at Beijing after Chinese President Xi Jinping pledges 'complete reunification' - CNBC
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday pledged a ""complete reunification"" with Taiwan — drawing a strong rebuke from the democratic, self-ruled island, which criticized the Chinese Communist Party's ""dictatorship.""Taiwan and mainland China are separated by the Taiwan Strait, which is only about 100 miles wide (160 km) at its narrowest point.

It added that the Taiwanese people have long rejected the ""one China principle"" and urged Beijing to abandon military intimidation directed at the island.The ""one China principle"" refers to the concept that there's only one central Chinese government — the one under the Communist Party in Beijing.Under Xi's leadership, China has more aggressively asserted its claims over Taiwan, and there have been numerous  this year.Taiwan has also become a contentious issue between the United States and China.
