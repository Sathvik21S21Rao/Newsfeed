The leading candidate is Ebrahim Raisi, chief of Iran’s judiciary and close ally of the supreme leader. He is all but assured of a victory after the candidates who could have posed a serious challenge to him – including three reformists – were disqualified and prevented from participating in the election.The unprecedented disqualifications have outraged large groups of liberal and moderate voters, and . As a result, the turnout , and most likely a historic low. But who is Ebrahim Raisi, and how would his presidency alter Iran’s domestic and foreign policies? As an , I believe we can start to answer these questions by exploring his past.Raisi is a loyal regime insider with a long career in Iran’s judicial branch, which goes back .He was only 19 when the Islamic revolution deposed the shah in 1979. As a young Islamic activist, he caught the attention of several top revolutionary clerics, including Ali Khamenei, who became Iran’s supreme leader a decade later. Named the general-prosecutor of Kataj – a small city near Tehran – at age 20, Raisi quickly rose to more prominent positions. In 1989, when Khamenei replaced Ruhollah Khomeini as supreme leader, Raisi was promoted to chief prosecutor-general of Tehran.This promotion reflected the high level of trust that Khamenei had in him. While serving in these positions, Raisi also attended seminary and religious studies under Khamenei and other influential religious leaders.During the first decade of his career, Raisi convicted a large number of dissidents and political opponents of the Islamic regime and . Regime critics and his political opponents have condemned his direct role in these executions, particularly the large number of political prisoners who were executed in 1988.From 1994 to 2004, Raisi served as head of Iran’s general inspector office, which is responsible for preventing abuse of power and corruption in government institutions. It was in this position that he developed a . Even as he was appointed as the first deputy chief justice in 2004 and finally promoted to chief justice in March 2019, he continued his fight against corruption by prosecuting many government officials. His critics have argued, however, that his fight against corruption has been highly politicized and selective. They claimed that he targeted individuals who were affiliated with his political rivals such as President Hassan Rouhani.Raisi first ran for presidency in 2017 but was defeated by Iran’s current President Hassan Rouhani, who after two terms is ineligible to run again.In this year’s election, Raisi is the favorite candidate of the conservative right wing of the Islamic ruling elite and also enjoys the support of Ayatollah Khamenei, who has absolute power over all branches of government. Khamenei also directly appoints half of the 12-member Council of Guardians, which oversees all political elections and has the power to disqualify candidates without any public explanation. Khamenei .One of the institutional weaknesses of Iran’s political system since the 1979 Islamic revolution is the potential for tension and disagreement between the elected presidents and the supreme leader.That is, unlike in the U.S. system of government, the . For example, a reformist president may want to engage more with the West or stay out of a foreign conflict, but the supreme leader could overrule or simply ignore him.As a protege and close ally of the supreme leader, Raisi is expected to support Khamenei’s policies on both domestic and foreign policy – which means more coordination between the various branches of government. With the Parliament also dominated by Khamenei supporters, it also means that the conservatives will control all three branches of the government once again after eight years.This harmony means Raisi would be a lot more effective as president because whatever policies he pursues would most likely be supported by the supreme leader. And perhaps ironically, his victory could pave the way for a more compromising attitude on the side of Iran in the negotiations that are currently underway in Vienna for restoration of the 2015 nuclear agreement, which was derailed by former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018.  The reason for this unconventional prediction is that both reformist and conservative factions in Iran are fully aware that a new nuclear agreement, which could end the severe economic sanctions imposed on the country, is highly popular. The team that signs the agreement will receive credit for ending the economic hardship the country is currently enduring. For example, inflation is over 50%, exports have plunged due to the sanctions and , up from 48% just two years ago.If Raisi becomes president, the conservatives and the supreme leader have greater incentives to reach an agreement with the United States for lifting the sanctions as they could no longer blame a reformist president for the economic hardships.The success of this strategy, however, is far from guaranteed.First, if Khamenei, Raisi and their hard-line supporters insist on maintaining Iran’s , it seems unlikely to me that the economic sanctions against Iran will ease. Not all of them are tied directly to the nuclear deal, including . Second, the growing alienation and frustration of large segments of Iran’s population – especially after reformists were banned from running for president – may still lead to mass unrest and political instability. Raisi’s victory can have an even more significant impact on Iran’s politics in the long run because it might pave the way for him to become Iran’s next supreme leader.  Ayatollah Khamenei is in his 80s, and a succession to a new supreme leader is considered likely in the next four years. According to many regime insiders, Raisi is considered the most likely to replace Khamenei if he wins the presidential election. If Raisi eventually becomes Iran’s supreme leader, he would have far more powers to shape all types of policies. Based on his background and values, he is likely to resist political and social reforms and try to gain legitimacy for the Islamic regime by focusing on economic development in a similar fashion to the authoritarian regimes in Asia, such as China, by focusing on economic growth while curtailing political and social freedoms. Raisi as president – and eventually as the supreme leader – would unlikely abandon Iran’s anti-Western foreign policy, but he has the potential to lower the tensions to a more manageable level in order to improve Iran’s economy.In my view, he seems to have recognized that the continuation of current economic hardships poses the largest threat to the Islamic regime in the long run.[Explore the intersection of faith, politics, arts and culture. ]

"Ask Dr. Nandi: Fast-spreading Delta COVID variant could have different symptoms, experts say - WXYZ
(WXYZ) — Scientists are learning more about the highly transmissible Delta COVID variant that was first detected in India. An ongoing study has found this strain is provoking different symptoms in those infected.Fever, cough, and loss of taste and smell are well-known symptoms caused by the coronavirus. Of course, not everyone who gets infected has these symptoms. And we know that some people don’t get any symptoms at all.But the traditional symptoms we’ve been told to watch out for, appear to be different with this new Delta variant. That’s according to a new study in the United Kingdom. It uses an app that allows the British public to enter how the virus affects them. After analyzing the data, here’s what the researchers found. The number one symptom at the top of the list is headache. Followed by sore throat, runny nose, and then fever. The researchers also noted that younger people were more likely to report a “funny off feeling” or that they felt like they had a bad cold.Now, you might be thinking, “those symptoms don’t sound so bad”. But, this Delta variant has been called “COVID on steroids”. Scientists have estimated it to be 60% more transmissible than the current dominant strain here in the US, which is the Alpha variant first found in Britain. And a Scottish study just found the Delta variant had nearly double the risk of hospitalization when compared with the Alpha variant.So, if more folks don’t get vaccinated in the very near future, it’s very likely that this Delta variant will take over. And this could lead to spikes in communities where vaccination rates are low. Which could then lead to more hospitalization rates, even amongst the younger age groups.Unfortunately, I know there are people who think COVID is no big deal. Or that the vaccines are not safe. But I strongly support science. And science has shown that COVID can be very dangerous. We’ve had over 600,000 Americans die from it. And there are many long-haulers struggling with debilitating symptoms. Science has also shown that our vaccines are not only safe, but they can protect people from the current variants, including the Delta variant. So once again, I urge those who have not been fully vaccinated to schedule your shots as soon as you can.As more people turn to a vegan lifestyle, Dr. Partha Nandi explores the pros and cons of a plant-based diet.

"In COVID hit Asia, mixed messages on refugee vaccinations - Al Jazeera English
Medan, Indonesia – Earlier this month, dozens of Rohingya refugees landed on a deserted island off the coast of Indonesia’s Aceh Province.The , having left Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh in a rickety wooden fishing boat, and were spotted huddling on uninhabited Idaman Island by local fishermen who used the island as a rest stop between fishing trips.By June 5, just a day after their arrival, all 81 refugees, including children, had been vaccinated against COVID-19.“The refugees were vaccinated in conjunction with the local government,” Nasruddin, the humanitarian coordinator of Geutanyoe Foundation, an NGO which provides education and psychosocial support to refugees in Indonesia and Malaysia, told Al Jazeera.“When we found them, they were in a crisis situation on the island with no food, water or electricity, so local residents brought them food and we also brought them 50 tanks of water,” he added. “The feeling on the ground was that we needed to share our vaccines with the refugees in order to protect them as well. No one complained that the vaccines were being given to refugees.”Aceh Province has been widely praised by humanitarian groups, NGOs and the general public for vaccinating Rohingya refugees, but elsewhere in Southeast Asia, asylum seekers, refugees and migrant workers have not been so lucky.When Nasruddin assessed the 81 refugees on Idaman Island, they told him that they had wanted to go to Malaysia. Some had family members who were already living there, while others were under the impression that the country had a more liberal policy towards refugees than its neighbours.Some of the Rohingya refugees who arrived in Aceh earlier this month. They told NGOs that they had wanted to go to Malaysia because they had family there or thought it would be more welcoming to refugees than other countries in Southeast Asia [Cek Mad/AFP]But like most countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia is not a signatory to the United Nations Refugee Convention and while the government has said it will vaccinate everyone living in the country, it has also taken a hard line on undocumented migrants and refugees, including Rohingya.“In February, the cabinet decided that in the interest of pandemic recovery all foreigners would receive vaccination free of charge, including refugees and undocumented migrants,” Lilianne Fan, the co-founder and international director of Geutanyoe Foundation who is based in Kuala Lumpur, told Al Jazeera.“The COVID-19 Immunisation Task Force and Science Minister Khairy Jamaluddin as coordinator of the vaccination programme, have been vocal advocates of this approach.“However, the recent statement of the minister of home affairs that those without valid documents should not be vaccinated, combined with renewed crackdown on undocumented migrants, contradicts the government’s earlier position and will simply  and slow down Malaysia’s pandemic recovery.”Malaysia went into its second strict lockdown at the beginning of June after cases of coronavirus surged – stretching hospitals and intensive care units to the limit. The health ministry announced 6,440 new cases on Friday.The government has indicated that it will ease the lockdown as more people are vaccinated, and Khairy has consistently stressed that the programme will include everyone living in the country.Why were the authorities spraying disinfectants on undocumented migrants during the operation last night?What is the purpose of doing so? Won’t that be harmful to their health?I hope @KKMPutrajaya @DrAdhamBaba @DGHisham can advise them properly. — Norman Goh (@imnormgoh) June 7, 2021But as it did during last year’s first lockdown, Malaysia has once again stepped up operations against undocumented migrants.Malaysia’s Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin has declared that PATI – the acronym for undocumented people in the Malay language – will be detained and sent to immigration detention centres.This month, he stressed that undocumented migrants had to “surrender” before they would be vaccinated.In early June, a video from state news agency Bernama showed 156 undocumented migrants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar being sprayed with disinfectant in Cyberjaya, near Malaysia’s international airport, after they had been detained.Last week the immigration department shared a post on its Facebook page – styled like a poster for an action movie – with the headline “Ethnic Rohingya migrants are not welcome”. After an outcry, but not before it had been widely shared among refugee communities, it was deleted.The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia on Monday expressed concern at “recent statements portraying migrants, undocumented or irregular migrants, refugees and asylum seekers as a threat to the safety and security of the country and a risk to the health of Malaysians” and urged the government to rethink its approach.“Instilling fear through threats of arrests and detention of undocumented foreigners is counterproductive in light of ongoing efforts to overcome the pandemic and achieve herd immunity,” it said, stressing the clear differences in the situations of migrant workers, and refugees and asylum seekers.Malaysia closed its borders during the first strict lockdown last year when immigration officers carried out a number of raids on areas under ‘enhanced’ lockdown. Rights groups fear more raids will deter people from coming forward for the vaccine that is crucial to Malaysia ending the COVID pandemic [File: Lim Huey Teng/Reuters]Rohingya made up about 57 percent of the 179,570 refugees registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Malaysia at the end of May.Unofficial estimates suggest the country may have as many as three million undocumented migrants, according to the International Organization for Migration.The mixed messaging on vaccinations for refugees is not exclusive to Malaysia.In a statement released in early June, the UN refugee agency warned that a shortage of vaccines in the Asia Pacific region was putting the lives of refugees and asylum seekers at risk.“Refugees remain especially vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19. Overcrowded settings, coupled with limited water and sanitation facilities, can contribute to increased infection rates and an exponential spread of the virus,” UNHCR spokesperson Andrej Mahecic said in the statement.There are almost 900,000 Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, making it the single largest and most densely populated cluster of refugee camps in the world. According to Mahecic, the number of COVID-19 cases in the camps has increased dramatically in the last two months.As of 31 May, there had been more than 1,188 confirmed cases among the refugee population, with more than half of these cases recorded in May alone.None of the refugees in Cox’s Bazar has yet been vaccinated against COVID-19.Mahecic added that, in many countries in the Asia Pacific region, there were not enough vaccines to go around, leading to groups such as migrant workers and asylum seekers being sidelined.The UNHCR had observed a “worrying increase” in the number of coronavirus cases among refugees and asylum seekers in countries including Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, he said.Indonesia, at least, appears to be starting to do more to address the problem.The UNHCR says COVID-19 has begun to accelerate in the crowded refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar, but no Rohingya living there have been vaccinated [File: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters]Other parts of the country have started to follow Aceh’s lead, according to the IOM, which vaccinated more than 900 refugees in the Indonesian city of Pekanbaru in Riau Province in early June in collaboration with the local government.“IOM applauds the response of the City Government of Pekanbaru for making vaccines available to the refugee community in the city,” Ariani Hasanah Soejoeti, the national media and communications officer of IOM Indonesia told Al Jazeera, adding that all refugees in the city over the age of 18 have now received vaccines.“Vaccines are one of our most critical and cost-effective tools to prevent outbreaks and keep individuals and therefore entire communities safe and healthy,” she said.“The virus knows no borders or nationality; and neither should our solidarity.”Amnesty and Asylum Access brought a case amid concern people returned to Myanmar may be at risk following military coup.Which countries will have access to the coronavirus vaccine sooner, and who will have access later?Concern about effect on vulnerable refugee children with discussion on alternatives to detention stalled.We investigate why the COVID-19 pandemic is forcing migrant workers –  the backbone of Malaysia’s economy – into hiding.",,"Explained: What’s at stake as Iran votes to determine next president? - The Indian Express
Iran’s presidential election Friday will determine who will lead the country’s civilian government as tensions remain high between the Islamic Republic and the West over its tattered nuclear deal with world powers.Among the four candidates, hardline judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi appears to be the front-runner based on state-linked polling. Abdolnasser Hemmati, the former head of Iran’s Central Bank, appears to be representing moderates in the race. Also running are Mohsen Rezaei, a former Revolutionary Guard commander; and Amir Hossein Ghazizadeh, a current lawmaker. At the country’s three debates, it appeared to instead be a two-man race as candidates largely targeted Hemmati for criticism over being part of the administration of current President Hassan Rouhani until recently.Rouhani, whose government reached the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, is term limited from seeking another four years in office.The Guardian Council, Iran’s constitutional watchdog that approves candidates, also barred a number of prominent candidates from running this year. They included Ali Larijani, a conservative former parliament speaker who in recent years found himself allied with Rouhani.Also barred was former hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He still remains popular for his populist policies while in office despite his antagonism of the West. While Larijani accepted being blocked, Ahmadinejad has urged his supporters not to take part in the vote.Meanwhile, women remain barred from running, as do those calling for wholesale change in the country’s government.Iran’s president oversees the civilian arm of the country’s government. The president sets domestic policy, which is important as Iran has faced years of crushing sanctions from the US after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal.Those economic problems have seen nationwide protests twice in Rouhani’s time in office. Iran also has faced wave after wave of new cases in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The presidency also sets the tone for how Iran interacts with the wider world. However, the winning candidate will be under Iran’s supreme leader, who has final say on all matters of state.At the heart of Iran’s complex power-sharing government created after the 1979 Islamic Revolution is the supreme leader. The supreme leader also serves as the country’s commander-in-chief of its military and the powerful Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force that also has vast economic holdings across Iran.An 88-member elected clerical panel called the Assembly of Experts appoints the supreme leader and can remove one as well, though that’s never happened. Iran’s current supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is 82 — leading some analysts to suggest this might be the last election he oversees.Iran describes itself as an Islamic Republic. It holds elections and has elected representatives passing laws and governing on behalf of its people, though the supreme leader has the final say on all state matters. However, the Guardian Council barred most allies of Rouhani and reformists from running in this election.Those who led Iran’s Green Movement after Ahmadinejad’s disputed 2009 re-election also remain under house arrest.Iran does not allow international observers to monitor its elections, which its Interior Ministry oversees. Security forces answering only to the supreme leader also routinely arrest and hold closed-door trials for dual nationals, foreigners and those with Western ties, using them as pawns in international negotiations.Raisi, as the head of the judiciary, faces international criticism for those arrests.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/06/Khamenei.jpg,"Taliban power pursuit has led to uncertainty in Afghanistan: Shringla - The Indian Express
India on Friday said the Taliban’s relentless pursuit of power through violence has created an uncertain environment in Afghanistan and the situation in the country is “fluid” at this point in time.And, with India stepping up its diplomatic activities in Afghanistan’s peace process as the US prepares for the troops withdrawal, Pakistan has said that at times it feels that New Delhi’s presence in the war-torn country is perhaps “larger than it ought to be”.In an interactive session at a virtual conference organised by Public Affairs Forum of India, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla listed the withdrawal of US troops and the attempt by the Taliban to steadily expand its influence through “targeted assassinations” and “territorial aggression” as reasons for triggering the uncertainty.“I think the levels of violence and the fact that despite talks going on in Qatar and other places, their relentless pursuit of power through violence has made it an uncertain environment in any sense,” Shringla said.“India has always been for a peaceful solution, we have always called for a ceasefire, we have always advocated that there should be talks between the government and the Taliban and others that are involved in this process, involving all the neighbouring countries,” he said.The Foreign Secretary said it would be difficult to say how things would work out in Afghanistan. “Many of those talks are on but as I said the situation is fluid and uncertain and at this point of time, it’s very difficult to say how things would work out,” he said.Shringla’s remarks came in response to a question on how safe it will be for Indian companies to invest in the mining sector in Afghanistan in view of the withdrawal of US troops by September 11.“We hope the time will come when companies can go in and invest and realise their returns on investments appropriately and there is peace and stability in the country,” he said. “Needless to say that is something that we are fervently hoping for as a neighbour and friend of Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan. But as I said the situation today is very fluid….”Shringla said the US troops withdrawal would create an environment of uncertainty. “When they pull out, it creates an environment of uncertainty and we have to watch and see,” he said.Meanwhile, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told Afghanistan’s Tolo news channel, “Obviously, you have sovereign relations and you have bilateral relations and you have every right to have sovereign and bilateral relations with India. You have trade with India. They come and carry out development work there, that’s completely fine with us.”“But at times we feel that their presence is perhaps larger than it ought to be because they… don’t share a border with you,” he said in an interview which will be telecast on Saturday. Excerpts of the interview have been posted by the news channel on its Twitter handle.When asked whether India’s presence in Afghanistan bothers Pakistan, Qureshi said, “Yes, If they use your (Afghan) soil against us, it bothers me.”Asked how India is using Afghan soil for anti-Pakistan activities, he alleged: “Yes, they are… By carrying out terrorist activities.”",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/06/Harsh-Vardhan-Shringla.jpg,"Antonio Guterres re-elected as UN Secretary General for 2nd five-year term - The Indian Express
UN General Assembly on Friday appointed Antonio Guterres as the UN Secretary General for a second term beginning January 1, 2022, days after the powerful Security Council unanimously recommended his name to the 193-member body for re-election.President of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir announced that Guterres “has been appointed by acclamation as the Secretary General of the United Nations for the second term of office beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2026”.Bozkir then administered the oath of office to 72-year-old Guterres at the podium of the UN General Assembly Hall.On June 8, the 15-nation Council had held a closed meeting where it adopted by acclamation the resolution that recommended Guterres’ name to the 193-member General Assembly for a second five-year term as Secretary General from January 1, 2022-December 31, 2026.Estonia’s Ambassador to the UN Sven Jurgenson, President of the Council for the month of June, had told reporters after the meeting: “We have all seen actually the Secretary General in action.“I think he has been an excellent Secretary General. He’s a bridge builder, his views on the conflict zones in the world and he’s able to speak to everybody. And I think this is something that is expected from the Secretary General and he has proven worthy of the post already with the five years that he has been in office,” Jurgenson said.India had expressed its support for re-election of Guterres as UN Chief and welcomed the adoption of the resolution recommending his name.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti tweeted “India welcomes the adoption of @UN #SecurityCouncil resolution recommending a second term to #UnitedNations Secretary-General @antonioguterres.”Last month, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar met Guterres at the United Nations headquarters and expressed New Delhi’s support to him for his second term as the world’s top diplomat.“India values UNSG’s leadership of the UN, especially in these challenging times. Conveyed our support for his candidature for a second term,” Jaishankar had said in a tweet after the meeting.Later a press release issued by the Permanent Mission of India to the UN also stated that Jaishankar “conveyed that India values Secretary General’s leadership of the United Nations, especially in these challenging times. He conveyed India’s support for his candidature for re-election for a second term”.
Under the UN Charter, the Secretary-General is appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. Each Secretary-General has the option of a second term if they can garner enough support from Member States.Guterres, the ninth Secretary-General of the United Nations, took oath of office on January 1, 2017 and his first term ends on December 31 this year. Former Prime Minister of Portugal, Guterres served as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for a decade from June 2005 to December 2015.Guterres, nominated by the Government of Portugal, has been the only official candidate for the position of Secretary General and his re-election was a given. There has been no woman Secretary General in the UN’s 75-year history and Guterres’ re-election will mean that any possibility of having a female lead the world organisation can come only after 2026.In March, Guterres had circulated his vision statement and earlier in May, laid out his case for a second term to UN Member States during an informal interactive dialogue convened in the General Assembly Hall.Guterres was elected after a reformed selection process that included a public informal dialogue session in the General Assembly, involving civil society representatives, aimed at ensuring transparency and inclusivity.In his vision statement ‘Restoring trust and inspiring hope’, Guterres said that the imperatives for the next five years include mounting a massive and enduring response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences in the short-term, leaving no stone unturned in the search for peace and security, making peace with nature and climate action, turbocharging the Decade of Action to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and advocating for a more equitable world, ensuring the centrality of human rights, taking gender equality to the next level, focusing on people, rising to the challenge of digital transformation, advancing multilateralism and the common agenda, embarking on a ‘United Nations 2.0’ and rekindling shared commitment to enduring values.“As we emerge from the pandemic, the UN is more relevant than ever. We must act as a catalyst and a platform for more inclusive, networked and effective forms of multilateralism. Our direction of travel is clear on peace and security, climate action, sustainable development, human rights and the humanitarian imperative. Our power to transform the current situation into a better world and future for all depends on everyone everywhere and can only be done successfully if we are resolute and resolved to combine our efforts towards our common agenda for the benefit of humanity and the planet,” Guterres said in his vision statement.

"IN FOCUS: The rapid rise of the Delta variant and how it is shaping Singapore's COVID-19 fight - CNA
SINGAPORE: On May 31, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong signalled that a new, dangerous front had opened up in Singapore's battle against COVID-19.It was not about the tightening or easing of restrictions, but a shift in strategy to contain a changing enemy.“Unfortunately, we are also fighting new, more infectious variants of the COVID-19 virus,” he said. “What does a more infectious virus mean for our fight against COVID-19? It implies that we must continually adjust our strategies and raise our game to keep COVID-19 under control.”Singapore, Mr Lee said, needed to do more of three things, and faster: Testing, contact tracing and vaccination against COVID-19.On Friday (Jun 18), Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Singapore has raised its contact tracing, testing and quarantine capabilities as well as vaccinated a ""good part"" of its population.“So I believe we are now able to put ‘circuit breaker’ behind us and keep most businesses open while navigating a wave of transmissions, as we have just done over the past few weeks,” he said.But even as he signalled progress was being made, Mr Ong also sounded a cautionary note: “However, with the Delta variant, we still need to be very careful of high-risk settings, meaning enclosed, mask off, and lots of interaction, namely in F&B (places) and gyms.”It is easy to see why the variants have created a new dynamic for the authorities to deal with.







The Ministry of Health (MOH) told CNA on Friday that as of the end of May, it has detected 428 local COVID-19 cases with the more infectious B16172 variant – recently dubbed the Delta variant – of the coronavirus first detected in India.The Delta variant has also been identified in 122 imported cases, MOH said.The B1617 variant has been called a triple mutant variant since it is split into three lineages, including B16171 (Kappa) and B16172.While MOH did not say when the first Delta variant case was confirmed in Singapore and which case this was, figures from the global epidemic tracker GISAID show that the first Delta case was detected here on Apr 1.The GISAID data did not indicate if this first case was local or imported.From Apr 1 to May 31, MOH announced in its daily updates a total of 574 new community infections.




MOH figures also showed that as of May 31, nine local cases have the B1351 (Beta) variant first detected in South Africa, seven local cases have the B117 (Alpha) variant first detected in Britain, and five local cases have the B11281/P1 (Gamma) variant first detected in Brazil.The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified these strains as “variants of concern” as they are more transmissible, virulent, or resistant to public health measures or treatments.MOH also said early in May that three local cases have the Kappa variant.The Kappa variant is a “variant of interest” under WHO’s classification, meaning it has caused community transmission and clusters, or has been detected in multiple countries.MOH said the National Public Health Laboratory conducts viral genomic sequencing on all COVID-19 cases in Singapore to detect variants.“Sequencing and analysis takes about seven days on average but it may take longer, particularly if there is a lower viral load in the swab specimens,” a spokesperson said. “Due to the time taken to carry out this process, variant cases will be reported as confirmed cases, but not necessarily as variant cases, in our daily press releases.”The spokesperson said sequencing is an ongoing process carried out concurrently with “prompt public health action”.“The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) reports regularly to GISAID as and when the analysis is completed,” the spokesperson added.CHANGI AIRPORT CLUSTERThe B1617 variant’s relentless spread was highlighted in the Changi Airport cluster, which ballooned to more than 100 cases in less than a month to become Singapore’s largest active COVID-19 cluster. The cluster was closed on Friday after going through two incubation periods without any new cases.The cluster’s index case, Case 62873, is an . He tested positive on May 5 despite being fully vaccinated.While it remains unclear how exactly the variant reached Singapore, spread so quickly and infected other members of the public, there were some early clues.Mr Ong Ye Kung said on May 14 that several cases linked to the airport cluster had tested preliminarily positive for the B1617 variant.The infected airport workers mainly received travellers from high-risk countries in the immigration and baggage claim areas, he said. These workers would then go on to have their meals at the Terminal 3 Basement 2 commercial area and food court, where they likely passed the virus to the community, he added.Initial transmission could have occurred through an airport worker who had helped a family from South Asia, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and Changi Airport Group (CAG) said on May 21. The family later tested positive for the virus.

On May 24, CAG chief executive officer Lee Seow Hiang confirmed that the B1617 variant was part of what caused the cluster.While the CEO said the airport had implemented “many layers of stringent safety protocols”, he acknowledged that “something changed” with the B1617 variant. “It penetrated our defences and caused a community outbreak,” he conceded.The Changi Airport cluster had 108 cases as of Friday, with the most recent cases reported on May 23.OTHER NOTABLE CLUSTERSAnother large cluster linked to the B1617 variant was the one that spread in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). This remains Singapore’s only COVID-19 cluster in a hospital. The cluster is now closed.A fully vaccinated 46-year-old female nurse at TTSH, or case 62541, became the first case linked to the cluster after she tested positive on Apr 27.By May 4, just a week after the first case was discovered, the cluster had swelled to 40 cases, MOH figures showed.On the same day, MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak confirmed that the nurse, along with four others in the cluster, were infected with the Delta variant. Authorities are still investigating the source of the cluster.Until now, variant cases continue to emerge alongside new clusters.MOH confirmed on Wednesday that one case in the new  had tested preliminarily positive for the Delta variant. The cluster was first identified three days earlier on Jun 13 with four cases linked to the food centre there. The cluster had 65 cases as of Friday.

Assistant Professor Hannah Clapham, who researches infectious diseases at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said it was important to study the clusters to learn about the Delta variant’s transmission rate, where and how it was spreading, and the effectiveness of the measures against it.“It would seem that the higher transmissibility of the B16172 variant did mean that it was able to evade the measures that were in place in Singapore,” she said.“It could also be that as this variant was spreading globally, we saw more introductions of B16172 into Singapore and therefore this is the variant that spread.”Other countries are also dealing with the new challenges presented by the more infectious variant. According to GISAID, the UK had reported 46,890 Delta cases as of Friday, the highest number of confirmed cases in the world ahead of India (6,684 cases) and the US (2,853 cases).The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday recognised the Delta variant as a “variant of concern”, with top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci encouraging everyone to get vaccinated, CNN reported. Dr Fauci pointed out that the Delta variant was in circulation in the United States at a rate similar to the tipping point seen in the UK, where the variant has become dominant.The UK had announced on Monday that it would delay the easing of COVID-19 restrictions by another four weeks, until Jul 19, following a rise in cases and the growing spread of the Delta variant.HOW MUCH MORE INFECTIOUS?Beyond the fast rate of infection, it is worth understanding how variants form and how a particular strain gains dominance over the rest.There are thousands of different coronavirus variants circulating worldwide. Viruses mutate all the time when replicating and most changes make no difference. Some even harm the virus.But others can make the virus more infectious and the disease more threatening – and these strains tend to dominate.“The few mutations that give a virus an advantage, such as being able to bind to the host cell better, tend to (allow the variant to) survive and eventually replace the other strains of the virus,” Dr Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, told CNA.

So, while experts CNA spoke to agreed that the Delta variant is more infectious, how much more infectious exactly is it?“PCR tests indicate that the amount of virus in the (Delta) samples is often higher than what we see before,” said Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director at the NCID.“This could be 100- to 1000-fold higher than expected, reflecting the millions of virus particles present in each specimen. This high viral load in the respiratory tract may imply higher transmission ability resulting in a large number of cases and at faster speed.”Citing research coming out of the UK, Dr Tambyah said the Delta strain was associated with secondary infections in 13.5 per cent of cases with local transmission. This is in contrast to 11 per cent for the Gamma variant and 8.1 per cent for the Alpha variant.AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION OF VARIANTSAnother worry is the potential airborne transmission of variants.While it has been established that COVID-19 infection primarily occurs through exposure to respiratory fluids carrying the virus, the science increasingly shows that the virus could also be spread by tiny particles suspended in the air.COVID-19 multi-ministry task force co-chair Lawrence Wong alluded to this on May 18 when recommending the wearing of masks with better filtration.“It's not just wearing a cloth mask, but wear one with high filtration capability – a surgical mask or one of those with the filter inserts,” he said. “That is important because of the latest evidence about the nature of the various strains, how transmissible they are and the fact that the spread can happen through aerosolised particles.”Professor Laurent Rénia, who studies infectious diseases at Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, said the issue of airborne transmission is still a matter of debate in the scientific community.“But evidence is accumulating that short range aerosol transmission may occur,” he said.NCID’s Prof Leo said the larger amount of virus excreted by Delta variant cases could be spread through various modes of transmission, including direct contact, surfaces and airborne droplets.“When a person sneezes or coughs, he or she produces a range of particles of different size and weight,” she explained. “The very small and light particles can be dispersed a longer distance away and some might linger in the air for a longer period of time.”

Professor Dale Fisher, senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) division of infectious disease, believes the variants’ more infectious nature makes it seem like transmission modes have changed.“What might look like a change in the mode of transmission is actually just because the virus is less forgiving,” he said. “Now, if an aerosol could have transmitted it before uncommonly, well maybe now it might be a little bit more common.”VACCINES EFFECTIVE AGAINST VARIANTS?With the variants being more infectious and potentially spreading through the air, some have questioned how effective current vaccinations are against these strains.Some studies have shown that vaccines are slightly less effective against the Delta variant, but the experts were quick to stress that the jabs still offered good protection and helped reduce severe disease.For instance, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, infectious diseases specialist at the Rophi Clinic, pointed to a UK study that showed the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 88 per cent effective against the Delta variant two weeks after the second dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech jab has a usual efficacy of about 95 per cent, meaning the chance of getting COVID-19 is 95 per cent lower after full vaccination.

In the Delta variant clusters, Prof Leo has seen vaccinated cases with family members who have tested positive. This means it could still be possible for vaccinated people to spread the virus.“Genetic sequencing monitoring by the National Public Health Laboratory is still ongoing and we cannot rule out that a vaccinated patient is capable of transmitting the infection,” she said.Still, Dr Tambyah said a vaccine effectiveness of at least 80 per cent was “more than enough to eliminate the virus eventually when enough people are vaccinated”.“Vaccine breakthroughs occur with any virus, including the highly successful measles and chickenpox vaccines, but when enough people are vaccinated, the breakthroughs are rare and of limited public health significance,” he said.Dr Tambyah said vaccines have shown “time and again” to be the only way to end an epidemic, including in smallpox and to a lesser extent polio and measles. “Careful vaccination strategies are needed to ensure that the community transmission of the virus in Singapore is significantly reduced,” he said.Forty-nine per cent of the population have taken their first doses of vaccination, and “slightly over” 35 per cent are fully vaccinated with both doses, Mr Ong said on Friday. As of Jun 15, more than 4.7 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccination have been administered in Singapore, he added. More than 2.7 million people have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.Still, the experts said Singapore’s vaccination strategy could evolve as more people got their jabs.If evidence shows that the variants could “escape” the immune response induced by the vaccine or after natural infection, NTU’s Prof Rénia said a booster injection of a new vaccine with proteins from the variants could be necessary.Dr Tambyah also pointed to the possibility of the authorities introducing “ring vaccination”, when contacts of a single case or small cluster are quickly vaccinated.While this approach has yet to be tried in the COVID-19 pandemic, it proved effective in mumps outbreaks on US college campuses, he said. “It may not work for secondary cases but it will reduce further spread,” he added.TESTING AND CONTACT TRACINGVaccination is just one brick in the wall keeping COVID-19 variants at bay. Testing and tracing strategies are set to evolve as the vaccination rollout progresses, the experts said. Routine and large-scale testing for COVID-19 could become part of Singapore’s new normal. Singapore is shifting its approach to testing, and this must be done faster, more liberally and extensively, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his televised speech in May.On Jun 16, rapid self-test kits went on sale in pharmacies. These help detect and isolate persons quickly when they are most infectious, and will be a “big help” in slowing the spread of COVID-19, Mr Lee said.With tests becoming faster and cheaper, routine testing could be done at more workplaces, restaurants and shopping malls, and for individuals like educators and taxi drivers whose jobs involve coming into close contact with many people, he said.Singapore will also contact trace more widely, Mr Lee said, with contact tracers working faster and better because they have more experience, skills and better tools like TraceTogether and SafeEntry.“I will be looking out for how the testing and contact tracing parts of the strategy change as vaccination increases,” NUS’ Asst Prof Clapham said.“Once we get to a very high proportion of the population vaccinated, we may worry less about asymptomatic infections, as we don’t have the same risk of these infections leading to outbreaks of severe disease.”IMPROVING SAFETY MEASURESUntil then, organisations at ground zero of variant clusters continue to ramp up safety measures. Both TTSH and Changi Airport put in place restrictions on people entering their premises and completed at least one round of testing for thousands of employees while also introducing other safety measures.“We now know many of the cases infected with new variant strains of concern, including B16172, have higher quantities of virus in their secretion,” said Prof Leo, noting that the preventive measures then become “even more important”.These include keeping the environment clean and well ventilated, as well as reducing human-to-human contact, she added.Dr Hoi Shu Yin, chief nurse at TTSH, told CNA that the hospital is cleaning and auditing its wards for hygiene more frequently. “We also took steps to improve air ventilation in our wards by retrofitting all general wards and ward toilets with exhaust fans,” she said, adding that high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters have also been installed.Likewise, Changi Airport’s terminals have been fitted with HEPA filters that prevent stagnant air and ensure constant air flow in a single direction. Airport workers are now segregated according to their COVID-19 exposure risk, with no mingling between zones.Other high-risk places are doing more too. The Singapore General Hospital said staff working in wards are required to wear N95 respirators, rather than surgical masks, for “a better mask fit”.The hospital is also swabbing non-vaccinated staff weekly and vaccinated staff every two weeks, its director of infection prevention and epidemiology Dr Ling Moi Lin told CNA.“It is critical that we reduce the transmission of the virus rapidly with good public health measures … such as good hand hygiene and masking, adequate ventilation as well as increasing the percentage of vaccinated persons,” said Dr Ling. “As long as there are viruses circulating, there is an opportunity for variants to develop and we need to remove that opportunity.”WHAT YOU CAN DOOn a personal level, the experts said the proper wearing of masks that meet filtration standards is integral in fighting back against the more infectious variants.In mid-May, health authorities recommended that people wear masks with better filtration amid a spike in variant cases and the emergence of new clusters. These masks, both single-use or reusable, should have at least a 95 per cent bacterial filtration efficiency, said MOH at the time. NCID’s Prof Leo reiterated that masks should closely and completely cover the nose and mouth. “If we sneeze or cough, do it with the mask on because we rely on the filtration function of the mask to limit the number of particles flowing out into the environment,” she said.

Beyond masks, Prof Leo said the usual measures still apply: Hand hygiene, staying home as much as possible as well as early medical attention and testing.“It is important to remember prevention measures work hand in hand together. No one preventive measure can work alone,” she added. “Community resilience where everyone is doing their very best is key to combating SARS-CoV-2 that is elusive in nature.”To overcome the variants, NUH’s Prof Fisher said people should adhere to the same measures, like minimising contact with others, more seriously.“It’s more about doing all the things that we know and doing them well,” he added. “So it’s actually the same measures – they’re just being (implemented) more aggressively.”VARIANTS WILL CONTINUE TO EMERGENevertheless, the experts agreed that despite Singapore’s best efforts, different and new variants will probably continue to emerge and re-emerge over time. New strains that are even more transmissible and less virulent, meaning they cause less severe disease, are “extremely likely” to emerge, said Dr Tambyah. “After a few years, the virus will probably become like one of the common cold viruses widespread but deadly only to the elderly and vulnerable,” he added. Dr Tambyah highlighted the Russian flu in the late 19th century as one example of this. It eventually became a seasonal coronavirus now seen regularly by doctors.

The experts stressed that new variant strains arise when viruses evolve to adapt and evade human defences, with each variant bringing different challenges. “Most experts, including myself, believe that SARS-CoV-2, unlike SARS-CoV (which caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), will stay with us,” said Prof Leo. “It will continue to evolve and we humans will continue to develop defence mechanisms such as vaccines and treatment.”The human versus COVID-19 struggle is “expected to be dynamic” and “occasionally volatile with blips of resurgence” in cases, she said. “We foresee ongoing restriction-relaxation to achieve some degree of balance allowing the healthcare system to cope with the cases and the entire society to return to the desired state of productivity,” she added.

But Dr Leong at the Rophi Clinic warned against a lapse in measures like wearing masks and safe distancing, highlighting that the coronavirus could “mutate against the vaccine”.“The weaker we are in this defence, the more likely replication and in turn mutations and variants appear,” he added.“Disorganised, half-hearted attempts are exactly the prescription for viral mutants.”",,"Malaysian experts suspect Covid-19 variants behind growing number of patients arriving dead in hospitals - The Straits Times
KUALA LUMPUR - A growing number of Covid-19 patients are dying before they can make it to a hospital in Malaysia and experts are concerned about the trend.They say this may be due to newer and more virulent variants of the coronavirus,  emerging in the country.The condition of patients may have deteriorated faster because of the new variants, the government's Covid-19 Epidemiological Analysis and Strategies Task Force chairman, Professor Awang Bulgiba Awang Mahmud, told The Straits Times.Data from the Ministry of Health showed that 370 victims were classified as brought in dead (BID) at hospitals as at June 14. More than half of that number or 195 cases were registered in the four weeks between May 14 and June 14.Only 136 cases were reported as BID for the whole of last year.The number of Covid-19 deaths overall has also spiked, from just 471 last year to more than 3,000 so far this year.""Since those patients were not admitted to the hospital, they may have deteriorated rapidly. We do not have post-mortem reports on them, so it is difficult to know what they died of and Malaysia's genomic or epidemiological surveillance is low, so we do not have a clear picture of the virulence of the current variants,"" said Datuk Awang Bulgiba.Infected persons may have brushed off their symptoms as just the common cold or a minor cough, not thinking that they had been infected with Covid-19.Thus they were not tested and when they deteriorated rapidly, they were brought in dead, he added.Furthermore, for some remote areas such as the interior of Sabah and Sarawak, medical facilities may be far away and not readily accessible.Variants may have different signs and symptoms of infection, and patients may not recognise them as being due to a Covid-19 infection, he noted. Although those infected may not feel ill, they can be contagious and put others at risk.The vaccination roll-out needs to be accelerated in order to protect more people quickly.""To prevent severe Covid-19 from developing, the government really needs to ramp up its vaccination efforts further. I suggest that we ramp this up to say 300,000 to 500,000 doses per day. This will reduce spread by asymptomatic and unlinked or sporadic cases, which is worryingly high at the moment,"" said Prof Awang Bulgiba.Malaysia is struggling to flatten the curve of infections with a third The number of new cases announced on Friday (June 18) was 6,440.Some 200,000 vaccinations are being given out each day as the country races to immunise as many as it can.""Any DOA (dead on arrival) case is worrying,"" said virologist Chee Hui Yee at Universiti Putra Malaysia's Medicine and Health Sciences Faculty.The deaths could have occurred due to a lack of self-regulation or even a lack of awareness of infection, she was quoted as saying by the Malaysian Insight news website.Dr Chee said Covid-19 patients should use oximeters to measure their oxygen levels while in quarantine at home.People should also get tested for Covid-19 immediately if they have symptoms, regardless of whether they have been in close contact with a positive case or not.",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/medium/public/articles/2021/06/11/yq-mycov-11062021.jpg?itok=sGfhH_qw,"Commentary: Southeast Asia risks falling behind other regions in recovering aviation and tourism - CNA
SINGAPORE: It has been a rough quarter for Southeast Asia’s aviation and tourism sectors as new record waves of COVID-19 cases have set back domestic recoveries and timelines for resuming international travel.Southeast Asia now faces a slower recovery than other regions, which could have economic implications and make it harder to attract international tourists for potentially several years.However, there is a light at the end of the tunnel as vaccine rollouts are starting to accelerate throughout the region.SOUTHEAST ASIA HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONVaccines have been the key in reopening borders elsewhere around the world and in reducing or waiving quarantine requirements for vaccinated travelers.Globally, more than 25 countries have waived quarantine or have plans in place to soon start waiving quarantine for vaccinated travelers.Yet, Southeast Asia has been going in the opposite direction, with some countries increasing quarantine from 14 to 21 days in recent months even for vaccinated travelers, making it impossible to recover international traffic.International passenger traffic in Southeast Asia has been stalled for several months at around 3 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, which is slightly below the current Asia-Pacific average of around 4 per cent and well below the current global average of around 15 per cent.

The gap between Asia-Pacific, including Southeast Asia, and the rest of the world will grow over the next few months as other regions gradually reopen, particularly to vaccinated travelers.While COVID-19 case numbers in Southeast Asia are currently at record or near record levels, it is critical for governments to start planning for a gradual reopening of borders, initially to vaccinated travelers.This is not the time to swing open borders but it is the time to put in place new travel protocols and a framework to facilitate a resumption of international travel.THAILAND SETS THE STANDARD?Thailand’s bold declaration on Wednesday (Jun 16) to reopen to vaccinated travelers within 120 days is encouraging and is the first example of a Southeast Asian country providing a reopening timeline.However, it is just a start as Thailand is just one country and has made several U-turns over the last several months, making it somewhat questionable its borders will swing open by October.There are still questions on whether Thailand will be able to start a quarantine free pilot programme in Phuket on Jul 1, when the island is slated to reopen to vaccinated travelers from low- to medium-risk countries provided the visitor does not leave the island for 14 days and meets several requirements.

The Phuket “Sandbox” plan is aimed at tourists from outside the region, particularly Europe, because it is impossible to attract visitors from other countries in Southeast Asia or anywhere in Asia-Pacific until their quarantine requirements are relaxed or waived.A MULTILATERAL EFFORT NEEDED The 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should be working together – ideally on a multilateral rather than bilateral basis – to lay the foundation for a resumption of travel within and to and from the region.For the last year, I’ve been advocating for the ASEAN Secretariat to step up and help facilitate a recovery for Southeast Asia’s aviation and tourism industries.In a June 2020 commentary, I urged ASEAN to become more active, pointing out the impact of un-harmonised standards and protocols as well as advocating the concept of travel bubbles.I subsequently expanded on this concept in a white paper published in December 2020 by the Aviation Studies Institute at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), recommending a pan-ASEAN air transport bubble to facilitate a resumption of international air travel between ASEAN countries.An update to the white paper was published by SUTD earlier this month, concluding that “a pan-ASEAN air transport bubble as well as other ASEAN initiatives such as the ASEAN health passport would help facilitate an earlier regional recovery and provide major economic benefits”.ASEAN stated in March 2021 it was considering a common digital vaccine passport but this initiative has so far failed to progress due to a lack of confidence in its feasibility and the failure of any member-nation to step forward and lead the way.While the ASEAN health passport may not be achievable, the 10 member countries can still work together on standards and protocols, which would help facilitate a general reopening.Airlines in ASEAN have talked to IATA and more than a dozen other suppliers of proposed travel passes but have not moved forward due to a lack of buy-in and consensus.While there are several travel app trials in Southeast Asia involving airlines and governments, there has been little to no progress in approving any of the available platforms or the general concept.CONTINUED LACK OF CONSENSUSA continued lack of consensus on new air travel standards and protocols also remains an obstacle.Several ASEAN countries have still not adopted the new air travel guidelines recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) initially published in June 2020 and updated in December 2020 and again in March 2021.ASEAN countries and in some cases local government units within countries have adopted their own regulations, resulting in a complex patchwork of rules that can be difficult to adhere to, leading to confused passengers and unusually long airport check-in times.

Mutual recognition of COVID-19 tests and vaccines is particularly important but has so far failed to materialise.Some countries are only recognising the vaccines they have been using in their own countries rather than all vaccines recognised by the World Health Organisation.For example, the Philippines earlier this month reduced its quarantine requirement from 14 to seven days but only for individuals vaccinated in the Philippines.It is encouraging the Philippines has reduced quarantine times for some vaccinated travelers, but the impact will be limited until this also applies to overseas Filipinos or visitors who were vaccinated abroad.Vietnam also has been looking at reducing or waiving quarantine, currently 21 days, to vaccinated travelers but some initial reports indicate it would be limited to travelers inoculated with vaccines approved for use in Vietnam.ASEAN countries should urgently consider a mutual vaccination recognition scheme, which would help facilitate a resumption of international travel.For example, a Singapore resident vaccinated with Moderna should be able to qualify for reduced quarantine in Vietnam, Philippines or any other ASEAN country even though Singapore is the only ASEAN country using Moderna as part of its COVID-19 vaccination programme.Reduced quarantine for all vaccinated travelers in ASEAN would be a welcome first step and could subsequently be followed by waiving quarantine requirements for vaccinated travelers.ASEAN RISKS LAGGING BEHIND OTHER REGIONSIf ASEAN does not start putting in place the building blocks needed to support a resumption of international travel – such as mutual recognition of vaccines – there can be long-term economic implications as other regions start to gradually reopen to vaccinated travelers.Companies in the ASEAN aviation and travel sectors will struggle to survive a prolonged closure of the international market and will also be at a competitive disadvantage to competitors in other regions as their customers from outside ASEAN discover alternative destinations.Domestic travel is important and during the pandemic has helped companies based in those ASEAN countries with significant domestic markets.However, from a revenue and economic perspective, ASEAN is much more dependent on international tourism.

ASEAN also has a domestic market that is smaller and that has so far recovered slower than other regions.Domestic passenger traffic in ASEAN reached around 50 per cent of pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter of 2020 but declined in the first quarter of 2021 and has declined further in the second quarter of 2021 as new waves of cases led to local travel restrictions.Domestic traffic is currently at about 30 per cent of pre-pandemic levels while globally domestic traffic is now at about 75 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.While domestic travel in ASEAN could start improving again in the third quarter of this year, it will continue to lag the global average while the more critical international market will likely remain stalled at current levels until at least the fourth quarter of this year.Not much can be done about the bleak outlook for the next few months except hunker down and weather the storm as ASEAN countries focus on containing the virus and rolling out vaccines.However, now is the time for the ASEAN Secretariat and ASEAN countries to step up and put in place the protocols and framework to facilitate a recovery in international travel that could start later this year and reach significant levels early next year, as vaccination rates reach herd immunity levels.If the groundwork is not done over the next few months, the risk is an even slower recovery and an even wider gap between ASEAN and the rest of the world with potentially devastating consequences.Brendan Sobie is the founder of Singapore-based independent aviation consulting and analysis firm Sobie Aviation.

HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - The BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine triggered ""substantially higher"" levels of antibodies compared with the Chinese-made Sinovac jab, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday (June 19), citing a study by the University of Hong Kong.The results suggested some recipients of the Sinovac vaccine may need a third shot, the newspaper said, citing lead researcher Benjamin Cowling.The epidemiologist led the government-commissioned study that tracked antibody responses of 1,000 vaccinated people.Professor Cowling warned that antibody tests might fail to pick up small amounts of antibodies generated by the Sinovac jabs.He was commenting on a recommendation by the government's scientific advisers to cut quarantine time for vaccinated travellers who test positive for antibodies but negative for the virus, the newspaper said.",https://static.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/medium/public/articles/2021/06/11/yq-mycov-11062021.jpg?itok=sGfhH_qw,"Crowds gather for hearing of two Apple Daily executives on national security charge - CNA
HONG KONG: Crowds gathered outside a Hong Kong court early on Saturday (Jun 19) ahead of a hearing for two executives of newspaper Apple Daily charged under the city's sweeping national security law, in a case that has drawn international condemnation.Editor-in-chief Ryan Law, 47, and chief executive Cheung Kim-hung, 59, were among five Apple Daily executives arrested on Thursday when , which authorities described as a ""crime scene.""Both are charged with collusion with foreign powers, raising alarm over media freedoms in the financial hub as authorities intensify a crackdown under the contentious legislation.The other three, chief operating officer Chow Tat-kuen, deputy chief editor Chan Puiman and chief executive editor Cheung Chi-wai, were released on bail late on Friday, according to Apple Daily.

Dozens of supporters were queuing to get seats in court on Saturday morning, including many former and current employees of Apple Daily, a popular 26-year-old paper.Some held yellow umbrellas or wore Apple Daily T-shirts saying, ""No fear, fight on.""""I already left Apple Daily due to personal and safety reasons,"" said Chan, 37, a former Apple Daily reporter.""I hope the two being charged can think about themselves first. They also have their families. I worked with them before. We are like friends.""A staff member, who gave her surname as Chang, said she and many other Apple Daily employees treat ""every day like it is our last"" working for the paper.""At first, authorities said the national security law would only target a tiny number of people,"" she told AFP.""But what has happened showed us that is nonsense,"" she added.

Another staff reporter, who gave her first name as Theresa, said she felt Apple Daily's legal troubles were a warning shot.""I think what has happened to Apple Daily today can eventually happen to every other news outlet in the city,"" she said.""Right now, you can be charged with NSL because of a word or a speech that they didn't like. It’s a big regression,” Lo, 29, a reader.The national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020 on the former British colony has brought an authoritarian tone to most aspects of life in Hong Kong, including education and arts.It punishes what Beijing broadly refers to as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.Police said dozens of the newspaper's articles were suspected of violating the national security law - the first time media articles have been cited as potentially falling foul of the legislation.The arrests and scale of the Apple Daily raid have been criticised by Western nations, global rights groups, press associations and the chief UN spokesperson for human rights.Apple Daily and its listed publisher Next Digital have come under increasing pressure since their owner, pro-democracy activist and staunch Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, was arrested last year under the legislation.Lai, whose assets have been frozen under the security law, is already in jail for taking part in unauthorised assemblies and awaiting trial in his national security case.As investigations into Apple Daily and its senior executives ramp up, some employees and observers have expressed deepening concern over the newspaper's future.Since the law was imposed by Beijing in June last year, more than 100 people have been arrested, with most denied bail.",

HARARE - The International Monetary Fund forecasts Zimbabwe's economy will grow by 6% this year, nearly double its previous estimate, after weathering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the IMF said.The Fund's optimistic forecast was released after Zimbabwe Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube aimed for punchy 7.8% growth following years of contraction.The coronavirus pandemic hit just as Zimbabwe's economy had contracted by 6% in 2019, partly due to monster cyclone Idai and a devastating drought. In 2020, the country's gross domestic product declined by a further 4%.""However, an economic recovery is underway in 2021, with real GDP expected to grow by about 6%,"" the IMF said in a statement late Wednesday following a two-week virtual visit.It said growth would be buoyed by a ""bumper agricultural"" harvest, increased energy production and a pick up in manufacturing and construction activities.""Zimbabwe has shown resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and other exogenous shocks,"" an IMF statement said.It added that the southern African country had cleared outstanding arrears to the fund in late 2016.The Fund nonetheless called for more efforts to cement the trends and quicken reforms, such as improving the business climate and foreign exchange and monetary policies.Zimbabwe has been struggling for more than a decade marked by hyperinflation and weak economic activity.

",,"Phumzile Van Damme slams WHO's 'no booze for women of childbearing age' proposal - TimesLIVE
Former MP Phumzile Van Damme has slammed the World Health Organisation's proposal to ban alcohol consumption for women of childbearing age. This is one of the proposals contained in the first draft of the organisation's Global Alcohol Action Plan 2022-2030, released this week.In the document, the organisation said the harmful use of alcohol resulted in about three million deaths in 2016 and that diseases and injuries attributable to alcohol consumption remain high. The organisation said awareness must be raised to curb incidents of irresponsible alcohol consumption. “Appropriate attention should be given to the prevention of the initiation of drinking among children and adolescents, prevention of drinking among pregnant women and women of childbearing age, and protection of people from pressures to drink, especially in societies with high levels of alcohol consumption where heavy drinkers are encouraged to drink even more,” said the organisation. Van Damme questioned what she called the policing of women's bodies, saying men should also take responsibility for their health.A woman’s womb is everyone’s business but her own. Mind your own testicles if they give you the power to think you have authority of women’s bodies. Mind your own womb if you are willing to give away your autonomy.Your testicles are a safe place for sperm that become babies. That privilege comes with responsibility. Perhaps WHO must also ban drinking for men because of this orikanjani? The organisation said awareness must be raised to teach people about the dangers of alcohol consumption, which it says goes beyond its impact on non-communicable diseases. “The impact of harmful use of alcohol on health and wellbeing should not be limited to the impact on non-communicable diseases but should be expanded to include other areas of health and development, such as mental health, injuries, violence, infectious diseases, productivity at workplaces, family functioning and a 'harm to others' perspective,” it said.Van Damme is not the only one who thinks the proposal polices women:I've just seen my old employer the WHO has said women of 'childbearing age' shouldn't drink alcohol at all.What nonsense is this?This nannying and patronising just has to stop. People can make up their own minds about what is right for them.Enough!Hi @WHO could you do a study please on the affect of alcohol on sperm production, size, quantity and the affects of drinking on men's fertility please? Cos apparently it badly affects men's fertility. Are men going to be 'prevented' from drinking too? Or is it just women?",,"South Africa to the world: Here's an updated list of countries SA travellers can visit - IOL

"US Catholic bishops approve document that could lead to Biden being denied Communion over abortion support - The Independent
Over the warnings of the Vatican, the conference of US Roman Catholic bishops approved a plan to draft a statement on the full meaning of the sacrament of the Eucharist, part of a conservative push to condemn president Joe Biden for regularly receiving Communion at Mass despite his support for abortion, even though the church opposes it. The decision, made public on Friday, was approved with 73 percent of the vote during June’s national meeting of US bishops. The statement itself isn’t written,  suggested it would “include the theological foundation for the Church’s discipline concerning the reception of Holy Communion and a special call for those Catholics who are cultural, political, or parochial leaders to witness the faith.”“That’s a private matter and ,” Mr Biden said on Friday, after being asked about the vote.The effort exposes divisions both within US Catholic leadership, and between American bishops and the Vatican.Some supported the move.“Our credibility is on the line. … The eyes of the whole country are on us. If we don’t act courageously, clearly and convincingly on this core Catholic value, how can we expect to be taken seriously on another matter?” San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone sai during discussion of the measure, The Washington Postreported. Others argued such an explicit, political rebuke to Mr Biden, a devout Catholic and only the nation’s second president to hold that faith, would pull the church into partisan warfare.“The Eucharist itself will be a tool in vicious partisan turmoil. It will be impossible to prevent its weaponization, even if everyone wants to do so,” San Diego Archbishop Robert McElroy said during the meeting. “Once we legitimize public-policy-based exclusion … we’ll invite all political animosity into the heart of the Eucharistic celebration.”Last month, Cardinal Luis Ladaria, the Vatican’s top doctrinal official,  that making policies about politicians receiving communion would “become a source of discord rather than unity.”The president has said he both personally supports abortion access in society, while , but his election provoked a furious response in some corners of the US Catholic Church.After the victory, Los Angeles Archbishop José H. Gomez created a working group to address potential clashes between the church and the administration. He warned on Inauguration Day that Mr Biden “would advance moral evils” through his stances “in the areas of abortion, contraception, marriage, and gender.” Mr Biden, meanwhile, hasn’t made talking about abortion a central part of his public policy, even as a conservative-leaning Supreme Court threatens to throw out landmark abortion rights cases like Roe v. Wade.In fact, as of late May, he didn’t even say the word “abortion,” according to one analysis. (He has, however, signed executive orders expanding abortion access and ending restrictions on using tax dollars for clinics that give information and counseling on abortion use.)During his time as a senator, Mr Biden voted opposed various measures related to abortion, including those that made special exemptions for victims of rape and incest, as well as limiting federal funding and health insurance access for abortion services. In his 2007 book Promises to Keep, he wrote that he doesn’t believe he has a “a right to impose my view on the rest of society.”Joe Biden at church in Wilmington, Delaware, on May 1, 2021.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Texas Republican representative Ronny Jackson has claimed US President Joe Biden does not appear to be ""physically or cognitively fit"". He has urged the president to be tested as his job is ""demanding"". It comes following multiple incidents where Mr Biden has sparked health fears with the public.Speaking to Fox News host Sean Hannity, Mr Jackson said: ""He's not physically or cognitively fit to be our president right now.""I know what the rigors of this job are, physically and cognitively - it's demanding.""He's not inspiring confidence.""It's sending the wrong message to our adversaries.""READ MORE: He added: ""We need to know that we can trust our president, and we need to know that he's in charge of what's going on and someone else isn't pulling the strings behind the scenes.""Because that's what it looks like now.""In March, Mr Biden was filmed falling over while walking up the stairs of Air Force One ahead of flying to Georgia.The 78-year-old quickly recovered from the fall and continued up the stairs.He appeared to trip on the steps twice before falling out of sight in footage widely shared online.Twitter users were quick to comment on the moment.One wrote: ""I just didn't get why Biden didn't take 2 seconds after the first fall to calm himself instead of forcing himself to speed up leading to the 2nd and 3rd falls.""People trip and fall.
