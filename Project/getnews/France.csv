"After LA Clippers are eliminated, Paul George says team would 'be going on' if Kawhi Leonard was healthy for Western Conference finals - ESPN
LOS ANGELES -- Not long after Chris Paul and the Phoenix Suns celebrated their Western Conference championship on the Staples Center floor, Paul George wondered ""what if"" Kawhi Leonard had been healthy.The LA Clippers ran out of gas and comebacks as their resilient playoff run came to an end with Wednesday's 130-103 loss to the Suns in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals.After the game, George allowed himself to think about the possibilities had Leonard not sprained his right knee in Game 4 in the previous round against the Utah Jazz.""We'd be going on,"" George said when asked what would have happened had Leonard played in the conference finals. ""This series would be a lot different. Talk about one of the best players in the league being out, yet we were inches away from getting to the next round.""So, definitely it's a 'what if' on this. Fact of the matter is we didn't do enough to win, and that's the reason we're going home.""The Clippers, the only team to overcome a 2-0 deficit twice in the same postseason, could not force a Game 7 against the Suns. Injuries and tired legs caught up to them. Besides Leonard missing the final eight games with his knee injury, the Clippers were without centers Ivica Zubac (sprained right MCL) and Serge Ibaka (back surgery).And they were playing their 15th game in 29 days, as all three of their rounds went six games or more.Still, Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said his players were stunned once the realization set in in the locker room that the season was finally over only two wins away from the NBA Finals.""It is a shock,"" Lue said. ""I think it's a shock to a lot of guys in that locker room. It just tells you a lot about the team. Like no matter who is playing, we still feel like every night we have a chance to win no matter who is on the floor. I thought we ran out of gas, and first thing goes when you get tired and fatigued is mentally. That first half, we made a lot of mistakes defensively, a lot of mistakes coming out of timeouts or just playcalls, in general; just not there mentally.""The Clippers had their share of defensive breakdowns, and Paul made his old team pay for each of them. He delivered a masterful second-half performance that was classic CP3, complete with all the things that make him such a pain for opponents. He buried 12 of 16 shots, including all five of his 3-point attempts, and scored 31 of his 41 points in the second half.After he drilled a 3-pointer to push the Suns' lead to 118-92 with 5:49 left in the contest, the Clippers called for timeout. As Paul walked back to the Suns bench, a frustrated Patrick Beverley shoved the Suns point guard in the back and was ejected.Knowing that he had gotten under the Clippers' skin, Paul would celebrate moments later by pumping both of his fists in the air.All George and Leonard could do was watch from the bench.George was terrific this postseason, especially once Leonard went down. The Suns sent some double-teams at George, who finished with 21 points and nine rebounds on Wednesday. Still, George answered even his harshest critics with his finest postseason, lifting the Clippers to their first-ever Western Conference finals.""Nothing that I didn't know already,"" George said of what he learned from this postseason. ""The narrative of me not being postseason player or all that, I never understood it.""""[But] I came up short again,"" George later added. ""I'm proud of what we did as a team. I wasn't out to prove nothing to nobody but to show up as a leader for this team and to put us in position to get to where we got to. Again, came up short. My good wasn't enough. There's room for improvement ... I'll look back. I'll reflect.""Moving forward, the Clippers will see what Leonard will do with his player option for the 2021-22 season.Also to consider is the future of point guard Reggie Jackson, who emerged as a clutch scorer for the Clippers this postseason. The Clippers have early Bird rights on Jackson. George, though, said his good friend likely has played himself into having plenty of options for his future.An emotional Jackson, who has revived his career with the Clippers, had tears rolling down his face when asked about his future with the team.""This year was my best year,"" said Jackson, who averaged 18.1 points and 41.5% 3-point shooting in the postseason entering Game 6.""First thing I told these guys was thank you for saving me,"" he said. ""I appreciate every guy in that locker room. I appreciate Paul for getting on that phone last year, at the end the season -- [when I] was talking a buyout with Detroit.""I'm thankful for everything I've experienced being here; this city making me feel at home. This organization welcoming me, my quirks, my strengths, my weaknesses; I wonder if I would still be playing without this team.""George said the Clippers have all the players to make another title run next season, if they are healthy. After melting down and blowing a 3-1 lead in the Florida bubble in the second round last year, the Clippers' resiliency this postseason put all the ""bubble talk"" behind them, as Lue said.And George and Leonard saw what they are capable of doing when healthy.""We've made great connections,"" George said. ""I think we've both grown, myself and Kawhi together. I think we really enjoy being teammates, and we see what we can be and what we can do.""George later mentioned the team's injuries, stating, ""I thought this team squeezed everything we could out of what we had. We squeezed everything out of one another, and I thought we got stronger and better as the season went on.""",https://annaadarsh.edu.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sport.png,"RJ Barrett Trade Rumors: Knicks Interested in Packaging SG in Deal for Lillard, Beal - Bleacher Report
The New York Knicks would reportedly be interested in including shooting guard RJ Barrett in a trade for a star guard such as Portland Trail Blazers point guard Damian Lillard and Washington Wizards shooting guard Bradley Beal.Kristian Winfield of the New York Daily News relayed the reported interest from a league source on Wednesday.The Knicks selected Barrett, 21, with the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft. The guard started all 72 games and averaged 17.6 points on 44.1 percent shooting (40.1 percent from three-point range), 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game last year.Trade rumors are circulating around Lillard following a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports that dropped Sunday.""The enormous backlash from the Portland Trail Blazers' process to hire a new coach and his concerns on whether a championship contender can be built have become factors that may push the franchise player—Damian Lillard—out the door, league sources told Yahoo Sports.""The 31-year-old Lillard, a six-time All-NBA player, averaged 28.8 points and 7.5 assists per game for the Blazers last year. He just finished his ninth NBA season.Beal has repeatedly stated that he wants to remain in Washington for the remainder of his NBA career, although trade rumors have persisted. He is under contract for the 2021-22 season but has a player option for the 2022-23 campaign.The 28-year-old Beal, a three-time All-Star, posted 31.3 points per game for the Wizards last season.The Knicks are looking to improve upon a 41-31 season that saw them make the playoffs for the first time since 2012-13.

We do not sell or share your information with anyone. OMAHA — It began as a baseball game.It ended as a wild, maroon and white celebration.After 129 years of playing college baseball — mostly high quality baseball — Mississippi State claimed its first national championship in any team sport Wednesday night. The Diamond Dogs body-slammed defending national champion Vanderbilt 9-0, as more than 20,000 Bulldog fans roared their approval. State fans cheered, they chanted, they clapped, they high-fived, they hugged, they sang, they danced.And some cried.The last few days, they have painted Omaha, a 13-hour drive from Mississippi, solid maroon.


The 2021 Bulldogs have accomplished what so many Bulldog legends — and so many splendid Mississippi State teams — could not. Will Clark and Rafael Palmeiro, Thunder and Lightning, couldn’t do it. The great Ron Polk, in two stints as State’s coach, couldn’t do it. John Cohen couldn’t do as a player or a coach – but he did as an athletic director. He hired the guy who finally did it: Chris Lemonis.These Bulldogs all did it. They endured COVID-19. They came back from losing three straight to Arkansas, two of three to lowly Missouri and then two straight in the SEC Tournament. They got hot at the right time, winning  an NCAA Regional, a tough Super Regional with Notre Dame and their half of the CWS bracket where they had to be tradition-rich Texas twice.They came back from losing their first game of this CWS Championship series by an 8-2 score to Vandy. As their coach Chris Lemonis has said so many times here lately: “Nothing comes easy for this team. We keep fighting.”He added to that postgame Wednesday. “We’re the last ones standing,” Lemonis said. “It’s a special night for all of us. There’s gonna be a big party tonight.”They won the national championship with their 50th victory of the year. They finished 50-18.These Bulldogs will be talked about for decades. Some may have reached legendary status already.Decades from now State fans will talk about how Will Bednar came back on three days rest and pitched six innings of no-hit baseball against the defending national champions. They’ll talk about how Landon Sims almost preserved the no-hitter. They’ll talk about the sharp-fielding Bulldogs played error-less, sometimes spectacular defensive baseball for the entire College World Series.And so many of them — especially the younger ones — will talk about how they were here when it happened. How they helped will their heroes to victory.In Starkville, they call it the Dude Effect. They brought it here to what they now call Dudy Noble North. The effect is real. It encourages State players to achieve feats they might not otherwise achieve. It causes skilled players on the other team to bobble the ball on plays they normally make in their sleep.It surely causes people around the nation who are tuning in to ESPN to wonder: Who cares this much about college baseball?Mississippi people, that’s who.Bednar was nails, sharp ones. After a shaky start in the first inning when he walked two batters and needed a double play to get out of the inning, he dominated Vanderbilt. Get this: He retired the last 15 batters he faced. His fast ball was good. His slider was devastating. Vandy couldn’t touch it, and they couldn’t lay off of it either.Conversely, State stuck to its obvious plan of attack against Vanderbilt pitching hero Kumar Rocker, a legend himself. They “spit on” Rocker’s hard-breaking slider that often looked like a strike before dipping out of the strike zone. They waited on his fastball — in the strike zone — and then made him pay.Rocker lasted 4.1 innings, 92 pitches. Rowdey Jordan laced Rocker’s first pitch — the first of the game — into right field for a ringing single. He scored later in the inning on Luke Hancock’s sacrifice fly. The tone of the game was set.State added two more runs in the second, two more in the fifth, when they chased Rocker from the game. All the while, State fans got louder and louder and louder. In the seventh inning when both Logan Tanner and Kellum Clark clobbered home runs, you literally could not hear your own voice. It was that loud, like the fourth quarter of a really close SEC football game.When Sims recorded the last out, State players rushed the field, celebrating in a sure-enough ‘Dog-pile around pitchers’ mound. They had done it. At last. And you know what dear ol’ Jack Cristil would have said: “You can wrap this one up in maroon and white.”Here in Omaha, on June 30, 2021, Mississippi State’s Bulldogs and their legions of fans did just that.

Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.before the first inning ended Wednesday night.Eight innings, two rain delays and some five hours later, Aroldis Chapman and Lucas Luetge returned the favor to place the dagger and twist it in a downright brutal loss.After Chapman walked the bases loaded and allowed a game-tying grand slam, Luetge relieved him and gave up three more runs to send the Yankees to an 11-8 loss to the Angels.“Terrible loss,” manager Aaron Boone said.“It’s about as bad as it gets right there,” added Giancarlo Stanton. “We gotta pick this s–t up. That’s it.”The Yankees (41-39) had led 7-2 after the first inning and entered the ninth with an 8-4 lead. It served as the latest stunner in their inconsistent season, which has packed plenty of drama into their four-game set against the Angels (39-41) before it wraps up Thursday. On Monday, Boone opened the series by saying the Yankees’ “season is on the line” before a fourth straight loss. Tuesday, general manager Brian Cashman said the Yankees “suck right now,” before they exploded for an 11-5 win.Wednesday, Chapman was booed off the mound by the remaining fans at Yankee Stadium after giving up the grand slam to Jared Walsh on a slider. It marked the second time he had coughed up a lead in as many appearances — this one dropping the Yankees to 8 ½ games back of first place in the AL East.“The big problem is the control of my fastball,” said Chapman, who was pitching for the first time since blowing a save against the Royals a week ago. “[I] got to find myself again with that pitch and come back and return to be Chapman that started the season.”Luetge relieved him and issued a walk and a single before pinch-hitter Luis Rengifo came through with a two-run, two-out single to put the Angels ahead 10-8. Taylor Ward added an RBI double as the Angels batted around, leading to the crowd mustering a “Fire Boone” chant before the inning mercifully ended.“Talk is cheap right now,” Boone said. “We need to go out and play full games and start hammering some people.”Stanton agreed that the time for talks has already passed.“At the end of the day, [if] we don’t turn up ‘W’s,’ you can talk f–king until you’re blue in the face,” Stanton said.Long before disaster struck, the Yankees had discovered the best way to contain Ohtani the hitter: quickly knock out Shohei Ohtani the pitcher.After the Angels two-way star had crushed three homers in the first two games of the series, he took the mound Wednesday and gave up a career-high seven runs and recorded just two outs. The Angels’ leadoff hitter threw 41 pitches and walked four batters as his highly anticipated Yankee Stadium pitching debut ended in a fizzle.Domingo German was hardly sharp himself, giving up three runs in three innings, though he left with a 7-3 lead.The game featured a pair of rain delays — the first lasting 42 minutes in the bottom of the third and the second taking 91 minutes after the top of the fifth — with thunderstorms rolling through The Bronx.After the lengthy second delay, which the Yankees entered with a 7-4 lead, Darren O’Day and Jonathan Loaisiga (two) combined for three perfect innings to protect the lead. Brett Gardner padded it in the eighth with a solo home run to make it 8-4 before the ninth inning from hell — a harsh reward for the crowd that stuck around to see it all fall apart.“Feel terrible for them,” Boone said. “They deserve better than this, especially staying late. We’re past one in the morning, whatever we are, hanging in there to want to see us finish that off. Obviously we certainly share in their frustration.”Share SelectionTHE BEST INSIGHTS FROM THE ULTIMATE INSIDERS

"After Losing China, Uber’s Stake in DiDi Reaps $8 Billion in IPO - Yahoo Finance
(Bloomberg) --Five years ago, Uber Technologies Inc. bowed out of the world’s second-largest economy by selling its China business to rival DiDi Global Inc. in exchange for a stake in the company. Now, the U.S. ride-hailing company is cashing in on its trade.Didi, the biggest ride-hailing company in China, raised about $4.4 billion in its U.S. initial public offering on Tuesday and sold more shares than it originally planned. Didi’s stock closed up 1% at $14.14 on Wednesday, giving the company a market value of about $68 billion.That makes Uber’s current 12% stake worth about $8.1 billion. Didi’s public offering is the second largest U.S. listing by a Chinese company, behind Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s $25 billion debut in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Founded in 2012 by Cheng Wei, Didi emerged as Uber’s biggest rival in China at a time the San Francisco-based company was vying to expand globally. In their battle for market share, Uber burned through billions of dollars before stopping its losses by selling Uber China to Didi, known as Didi Chuxing at the time. The deal left Uber with a 20% stake in its competitor. Uber has been selling some of its shares in Didi in the run-up to the IPO, reducing its holding from about 14% in the first quarter.Though Didi is dominant in China, momentum in the region is beginning to slow. The company plans to use the IPO funds to invest in technology, increase its presence in some international markets and introduce new products, according to its U.S. filings.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/c0OwgVpXSWr1up.1rNB6DQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MC4zMg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/x26OKli.3yOIYrNfwGBoaA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/3dc78058c93af5d880b0423b783cb893,"Financial regulator hits Robinhood for $70 million for ""widespread and significant harm"" to customers - CBS News
The stock-trading app Robinhood was ordered to pay nearly $70 million Tuesday by financial regulators for misleading its customers, causing them to lose millions of dollars.A major player in the recent stock market frenzy, Robinhood says its mission is to stand up for the little guy and ""democratize finance."" But in a 123-page complaint, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Robinhood inflicted ""widespread and significant harm"" to millions of customers by providing them with false information about their investments. FINRA, which has federal authority to regulate financial firms, said the company also failed to reasonably maintain its technology and neglected to do proper due diligence before approving customers for complex trades called options.FINRA said the fine is the largest it has ever levied and ""reflects the scope and seriousness of Robinhood's violations."" A CBS News investigation in February  that left users to navigate high-risk trades by themselves.One of those users was 20-year-old Alex Kearns, who died by suicide last year after mistakenly believed he'd lost nearly $750,000 in a risky bet on Robinhood. When his account flashed red, Kearns tried to email the company's customer service three times to ask if his negative balance was accurate. He received no response and took his own life, writing in a suicide note that he believed he had financially ruined his family. In an exclusive interview with ""CBS This Morning"", Kearns' mother and father said the company was responsible for their son's death.""I lost the love of my life. I miss him more than anything,"" Dorothy Kearns said. ""I can't tell you how incredibly painful it is. It's the kind of pain that I don't think should be humanly possible for a parent to overcome.""The FINRA complaint specifically highlighted the Kearns' case. The regulator said Robinhood violated regulatory rules by providing customers like Kearns ""false and misleading information"" that ""concerned a variety of critical issues, including … how much cash was in customers' accounts … the risk of loss customers faced in certain options transactions, and whether customers faced margin calls.""Following the CBS investigation, Robinhood In settling with FINRA on Wednesday, the company neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.Robinhood said in a statement to CBS News on Wednesday it ""has invested heavily in improving platform stability, enhancing our educational resources, and building out our customer support and legal and compliance teams. We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all.""As part of the overall settlement with the company, the regulator ordered Robinhood to pay more than $12 million in restitution to Kearns and thousands of other customers.""This action sends a clear message—all FINRA member firms, regardless of their size or business model, must comply with the rules that govern the brokerage industry, rules which are designed to protect investors and the integrity of our markets,"" said FINRA's Head of Enforcement Jessica Hopper in a statement.

LONDON — A group of some of the world's most powerful oil producers will meet on Thursday to decide the next phase of their production policy.OPEC and non-OPEC partners, an energy alliance often referred to as OPEC+, will convene via videoconference at 2 p.m. London time.The meeting comes at a time when OPEC+ is relatively upbeat about improved market conditions and the outlook for fuel demand growth following a sharp rebound in oil prices over the first six months of the year.The Middle East-dominated producer group agreed to implement massive crude productions cuts in 2020 in an effort to support oil prices when the coronavirus pandemic coincided with a historic fuel demand shock.The group, led by Saudi Arabia, has since initiated monthly meetings in a bid to navigate production policy and has already announced plans to increase supply by 2.1 million barrels per day between May and July. It will decide on Thursday whether to leave production policy unchanged or to ramp up supply further.Analysts say the most probable outcome is for an increase of around 500,000 barrels per day in August.Chris Midgley, global head of analytics at S&P Global Platts, told CNBC via email that OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia would likely maintain a ""cautious"" approach to production policy. This is because Riyadh would prefer to see global demand increase before adding supply and remains concerned about when Iranian oil could return to the market, he said.""OPEC is treading a tight rope to sustain more attractive prices without hurting consumer confidence while not adding too much supply ahead of the weaker Autumn shoulder period for demand,"" Midgley said.The U.S. and Iran have been discussing the possibility of a new nuclear accord. If that happens, Iran could return at least 1 million barrels a day to the market. The timing is unclear, however, and the oil would have to be absorbed into OPEC's production total if a deal is struck.""The global oil market is calling out for a substantial increase in supplies, but the Saudis are unlikely to oblige,"" Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note.""A smaller than expected return of oil should ensure that the market continues to draw down inventories over [the second half of the year]. But just as importantly, it also leaves the market in no doubt that the OPEC+ alliance, or better said Saudi Arabia, has full control of the oil market,"" Brennock said.International Brent crude futures traded at $75.47 a barrel during mid-morning deals in London, up 1.1%, while  futures stood at $74.28, also around 1.1% higher for the session.Oil prices have rallied more than 45% year-to-date, supported by an easing of Covid-related restrictions, an uptick in goods transportation and increased air travel. Analysts on Wall Street .However, the spread of the delta Covid-19 variant worldwide has heightened concerns of a setback to oil demand. Renewed lockdown measures and rising costs have already resulted in , for instance.""I think they will play it rather cautiously,"" Martijn Rats, chief oil analyst at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Europe"" on Thursday.""There are some genuine uncertainties that OPEC will need to navigate over the next 18 months, the precise trajectory of the demand recovery, when Iranian exports will increase again [and] what shale will exactly do. And for those reasons, I think justifiably they will take a rather cautious approach.""Historically, non-OPEC suppliers would look to take advantage of rising oil prices to increase investment, develop more oil fields and regain market share, Rats said.""On this occasion, that doesn't seem to be happening,"" he added. ""There is almost no non-OPEC investment response to these high oil prices. So, OPEC is also in somewhat of a more comfortable position perhaps to keep oil prices elevated without necessarily having to fear this historic threat of then losing market share eventually.""Rats said he expected OPEC+ to increase supply of approximately 500,000 million barrels from August, ""if not slightly below"" this estimate.Last month, OPEC said it expects oil demand to rise by 6 million barrels per day this year, with 5 million of that coming back in the second half of 2021.OPEC and non-OPEC partners would ""continue to play an important and valuable role in accelerating the oil market rebalancing process,"" he added.— CNBC's Patti Domm contributed to this report.",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg
"LISTING OF DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRESS RELEASES - Los Angeles County

			While transmission in L.A. County remains low, L.A. County is seeing increases in cases and daily test positivity.  On June 15, the day of the full reopening, the County saw 210 new cases and the test positivity rate was around 0.5%.  Nearly two weeks after the June 15 reopening, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) has confirmed a doubling of both new cases and the test positivity rate; today’s case numbers are 422 and the test positivity rate is 1.2%.     
  While the increase in community transmission is concerning, Public Health notes the increases are still far below the surge levels over the winter of over 15,000 new cases and the test positivity rate of 20%.    
  Of the two new deaths reported today, one person that passed away was over the age of 80 and one person who died was between the ages of 65 and 79. To date, Public Health identified 1,250,240 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,483 deaths.     
  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.

  While the increase in community transmission is concerning, Public Health notes the increases are still far below the surge levels over the winter of over 15,000 new cases and the test positivity rate of 20%.    
  Of the two new deaths reported today, one person that passed away was over the age of 80 and one person who died was between the ages of 65 and 79. To date, Public Health identified 1,250,240 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,483 deaths.     
  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  Of the two new deaths reported today, one person that passed away was over the age of 80 and one person who died was between the ages of 65 and 79. To date, Public Health identified 1,250,240 positive cases of COVID-19 across all areas of L.A. County and a total of 24,483 deaths.     
  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  There are 255 people with COVID-19 currently hospitalized and 25% of these people are in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  Testing results are available for nearly 7,026,000 individuals with 17% of people testing positive.    
  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  Public Health continues to caution there is increased risk of COVID-19 infection for people who aren’t fully vaccinated because of increased intermingling and the circulation of more variants of concern like the highly transmissible Delta variant.    
  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

  The best protection against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated. Public Health encourages those that are not vaccinated and are eligible to get vaccinated, to get vaccinated without delay.        
If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

If you are not vaccinated and around people outside your household, your mask offers the next best protection against the virus. With distancing requirements and capacity limits lifted in almost all settings, wearing a mask is critically important for those not yet vaccinated, including the 1.2 million children between the ages of 2 and 12.         
""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.

""To the families and friends experiencing the sorrow of losing of a loved one due to COVID-19, we send our deepest condolences,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “Last year, we didn’t have the vaccine and there were increases in cases and hospitalizations that occurred after the Fourth of July holiday.  This year we have three powerful vaccines but there are still about 4 million residents that are unvaccinated and at risk of COVID-19 infection. With small increases in community transmission and an increase in the circulation of the Delta variant, your best protection and the best protection for the County’s recovery are the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. And while we are increasing the number of people with vaccination protection, sensible public health precautions, including masking and hand hygiene can support our recovery.”        
People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more. If you don’t have internet access, can’t use a computer, or you’re over 65, you can call 1-833-540-0473 for help finding an appointment, connecting to free transportation to and from a vaccination site, or scheduling a home-visit if you are homebound.  Vaccinations are always free and open to eligible residents and workers regardless of immigration status.

People who are not fully vaccinated, including all children between the ages of 2 and 12, are required to wear masks at all indoor public settings and businesses. Because of increased circulation of the highly transmissible Delta variant across the country and to protect unvaccinated residents, Public Health strongly recommends everyone, as a precautionary measure, wear masks indoors in settings (such as grocery or retail stores theaters and family entertainment centers, and workplaces) when you don't know everyone's vaccination status.    

Through Thursday, July 1 at County-run vaccination sites, LA City sites, and St. John’s Well Child and Family Center sites, everyone 18 and older coming to get a vaccine will have an opportunity to win one of two packages, each containing season passes to Six Flags, the LA Zoo, the Natural History Museum and the La Brea Tar Pits, and ticket packs to the California Science Center. Official rules and participating site locations are posted online on the Los Angeles Vaccination Sweepstakes page. Winners will be contacted by phone and/or email.    
  Anyone 12 and older living or working in L.A. County can get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccinations are available at County-run sites, LA City run sites, almost all mobile sites and many of the community sites without an appointment. Many sites are open on weekends and have evening hours.    
    Visit:   www.VaccinateLACounty.com (English) and  (Spanish) to find a vaccination site near you, to make an appointment at vaccination sites, and much more.

Because many families of color chose to stay remote even if in-person instruction was offered, it's likely an even smaller fraction of their children received any in-person learning this past school year.The figures are important because reduced access to in-person learning has become increasingly associated with poorer learning outcomes and adverse mental health and behavioral development.The latest counts underscoring racial disparities in learning modes are from a government survey of 1,200 school districts in 50 states and Washington, D.C. They're paired with a strong dose of health advice from the CDC: Schools need to intensify vaccination efforts and other measures to reduce community transmission.-- Erin Richards, USA TODAYThe Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is effective against all variants of COVID-19, including the delta variant, which is thought to be more contagious,The study analyzed serum samples from eight participants one week after they received their second dose of the vaccine. Researchers found the shot produced neutralizing antibodies against all variants, including the three lineage variants first identified in India, the beta variant first identified in South Africa, and the two variants first identified in Uganda and Angola.“These new data are encouraging and reinforce our belief that the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine should remain protective against newly detected variants,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in a statement. “These findings highlight the importance of continuing to vaccinate populations with an effective primary series vaccine.”Several of Australia's major cities are under COVID-19 lockdown following a recent outbreak of the delta variant.Perth, the capital of Western Australia, began a four-day lockdown Tuesday and made masks compulsory after a resident tested positive, according to Reuters. Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, will also enter lockdown Tuesday.South Australia imposed new statewide restrictions Tuesday. Sydney in the east and Darwin in the north both locked down on Monday. Canberra made wearing masks compulsory.Most of the new cases are linked to an unvaccinated Sydney limousine driver who tested positive June 16 after transporting a foreign air crew from the airport while reportedly not wearing a mask.Australia has been relatively successful in containing clusters throughout the pandemic, registering fewer than 31,000 cases since the pandemic began. But the new clusters have highlighted the nation’s slow vaccine rollout, with only 5% of the population fully vaccinated.The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines created a long-lasting immunity that may protect people from COVID-19 for years, a new study found.The new results mean that people who received the mRNA vaccines may not need boosters so long as variants do not drastically evolve.As for those who recovered from the coronavirus and received the vaccine later on, a booster may not be needed even as the virus mutates, the study's results suggest. The study, published in the Nature journal, didn't consider the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in its research, but it's expected to be less durable.“It’s a good sign for how durable our immunity is from this vaccine,” Ellebedy told New York Times.Nearly all Wisconsinites — or not fully vaccinated — state health officials said Monday.And just 1% of all confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases since Jan. 1 have been among those who were fully vaccinated, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health Services said.The stark news came as Wisconsin finally reached a significant milestone Monday, with 50.1% of the state's population receiving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.Between March 1 and June 24, 95% of confirmed and probable COVID-19 deaths were among those who weren't fully vaccinated, DHS spokeswoman Elizabeth Goodsitt said in an email.""The science is clear: vaccines work in the real world.

"Judge Denies Britney Spears’ Request to Remove Father From Conservatorship Again - Variety
A judge has shot down Britney Spears’ request to have her father removed from her conservatorship — at least for now.New court documents that were filed by the Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday show that the judge has denied a months-old request by Spears’ attorney, Samuel Ingham III, to remove her father, Jamie Spears, as her sole conservator. These documents are not in direct response to last week’s hearing, where Spears gave an explosive testimony; though Spears delivered a powerful 24-minute statement, the judge cannot make any ruling based on what she said as she still has yet to file a petition to terminate her conservatorship. 











The new court filings are another legal setback for the singer, but the judge’s denial is nothing new. Samuel Ingham III had filed the request to remove Spears’ father back in November 2020, stating that his client was “afraid of her father” and would refuse to perform again, if her father continued to be in charge of her career. At that time, Judge Brenda Penny declined to suspend her father from the conservatorship, though she did not rule out future petitions for his removal or suspension. Also, at that time, the judge appointed financial company Bessemer Trust as a co-conservator.Today’s paperwork was solely intended for the judge to approve Bessemer Trust as the co-conservator, but also reiterates the judge’s decision to not remove the elder Spears from the pop star’s conservatorship.However, it’s significant that the document was signed by Judge Penny on June 30 — after the singer’s explosive testimony where she told the judge that her conservatorship was “abusive.”Last week, , marking the first time she had publicly addressed the court in her 13-year conservatorship. While speaking to the judge, Spears said that her dad enjoys controlling her life, and stated that she believes her conservators, including her father, should be in jail, and that she wants to sue her family.Spears’ case has garnered an enormous amount of global attention, with pressure mounting to support the pop star and remove her father from the conservatorship.Wednesday’s court filing states that the court found Spears to be “substantially unable to manage his or her financial resources or to resist fraud or undue influence.”Spears’ father has been her co-conservator since 2008, when the singer suffered a very public breakdown. He became sole conservator in 2019 after attorney Andrew Wallet resigned from co-conservatorship. In September 2019, he temporarily relinquished his powers and Jodi Montgomery became the conservator of her person, meaning she is responsible for Spears’ medical and personal well-being. Spears’ father remains the sole conservator of her estate, managing all of her finances — while making a hefty sum of of her annual multi-million dollar earnings, given that Spears has continued to record music and perform regularly at her residence in Las Vegas, while under her restrictive conservatorship. 








Earlier today, , pointing the finger at Montgomery with the father’s perspective being that he loves his daughter, is very concerned and has done nothing wrong.“Mr. Spears is concerned about the management and care of his daughter,” his attorney said in the docs. “Based on her statements to the court, Mr. Spears is concerned that the petition to appoint Jodi Montgomery filed by Ms. Spears’ court-appointed counsel Samuel D. Ingham III does not reflect her wishes. Ms. Spears told the court on June 23 that she is opposed to being under a conservatorship and revealed her ongoing disputes with Ms. Montgomery about her medical treatment and other personal care issues.”Montgomery strongly denied the elder Spears’ stance with her attorney fighting back, releasing a statement that she is a “tireless advocate for Britney and for her well-being.”Meanwhile, despite her father’s perspective and the judge’s ruling, the pop star has made her stance clear: she wants her father out, and wants to end her conservatorship altogether without further evaluation.“I cried on the phone for an hour and he loved every minute of it,” Spears told the judge, referring to her father. “The control he had over someone as powerful as me — he loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%. He loved it.”Spears pleaded to the judge: “I just want my life back. And it’s been 13 years. And it’s enough. It’s been a long time since I’ve owned my money. And it’s my wish and my dream for all of this to end without being tested.”",https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif,"Bill Cosby Freed From Prison After Sexual Assault Conviction Overturned By Pennsylvania Supreme Court - CBS Philly
PHILADELPHIA (CBS/AP) — Bill Cosby has been freed from prison after Pennsylvania’s highest court overturned his sexual assault conviction Wednesday. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that they found an agreement with a previous prosecutor that prevented him from being charged in the case.The country watched — some cheering, some dismayed — as Cosby was shackled and lead into prison more than two years ago. Just this afternoon, he was released from the State Correctional Institution Phoenix with little fanfareCosby has served more than two years of a three- to 10-year sentence at a state prison near Philadelphia. He had vowed to serve all 10 years rather than acknowledge any remorse over the 2004 encounter with accuser Andrea Constand.The opinions of the court blasted light on a press release issued by former District Attorney Bruce Castor more than 15 years ago. The document essentially promised that Cosby would not be prosecuted.Years later, Cosby then testified in a deposition and did not take the Fifth Amendment. He made incriminating statements, and those statements became the foundation of prosecutions against Cosby as it related to the accused indecent aggravated assault of Constand.Legal experts say the prosecution was essentially a violation of a written contract between the DA’s office and Cosby.The Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office released a statement on Cosby’s release:
The majority decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court orders the release of William H. Cosby Jr. from state prison. He was found guilty by a jury and now goes free on a procedural issue that is irrelevant to the facts of the crime. I want to commend Cosby’s victim Andrea Constand for her bravery in coming forward and remaining steadfast throughout this long ordeal, as well as all of the other women who have shared similar experiences. My hope is that this decision will not dampen the reporting of sexual assaults by victims. Prosecutors in my office will continue to follow the evidence wherever and to whomever it leads. We still believe that no one is above the law—including those who are rich, famous and powerful.The 83-year-old Cosby, who was once beloved as “America’s Dad,” was convicted of drugging and molesting Constand at his suburban estate.Constand and her legal counsel released a statement on the court’s ruling Wednesday evening.“Today’s majority decision regarding Bill Cosby is not only disappointing but of concern in that it may discourage those who seek justice for sexual assault in the criminal justice system from reporting or participating in the prosecution of the assailant or may force a victim to choose between filing either a criminal or civil action.On the one hand, the Court acknowledged that the former District Attorney’s decision to not prosecute Mr. Cosby was not a formal immunity agreement and constituted at best a unilateral exercise of prosecutorial discretion not to prosecute at the time, but nevertheless precluded a future prosecution, which included additional evidence developed in the civil case. the Supreme Court acknowledged that it was bound by the lower court’s credibility findings, including that Andrea Constand and her civil counsel, Dolores Troiani and Bebe Kivitz, were not privy to any discussions between the former prosecutor and Mr. Cosby or his then criminal counsel, let alone signatories to any agreement of any kind. We were not consulted or asked our thoughts by Mr. Castor concerning any agreements concerning immunity or anything, and we were not made aware if there were any such discussions. The press release had no meaning or significance to us in 2005 other than being a press release circulated by the then District Attorney.Once again, we remain grateful to those women who came forward to tell their stores, to DA Kevin Steele and the excellent prosecutors who achieved a conviction at trial, despite the ultimate outcome which resulted from a procedural technicality, and we urge all victims to have their voices heard. We do not intend to make any further comment.In the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s opinion, the judges “do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors ‘over whether charges should be brought in any given case,'” but rather the court examined if the prosecution performed within the bounds of due process.Legal experts say the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s opinion reveals parts of the Cosby prosecution were braced on a legal house of cards. Prosecutors who took the legendary comedian and actor to trial twice say the ruling is an unfortunate technicality.Cosby tweeted out a statement, maintaining his innocence and thanking supporters.“I have never changed my stance nor my story. I have always maintained my innocence. Thank you to all my fans, supporters and friends who stood by me through this ordeal. Special thanks to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court for upholding the rule of law,” he tweeted.Cosby’s return to his Elkins Park home was unceremonious in many ways but did inspire those passionate for and against the comedian to visit the property.In a T-shirt ode to his Philadelphia high school, Central graduate Cosby returned from prison, yielding comment to his attorneys and representative.“He said they was ringing his cell, they was just knocking on the walls the inmates, they said ‘you’re free! Get up! Get up.’ And he was just so excited,” spokesperson Andrew Wyatt said.Nearly 60 women accused Cosby of sexual assault. Attorney Gloria Allred represented several of the women and says her heart breaks for them.Phylicia Rashad, who played Clair Huxtable on The Cosby Show, took to social media after hearing the news Cosby would be released.“FINALLY!!!! A terrible wrong is being righted — a miscarriage of justice is corrected,” Rashad tweeted.FINALLY!!!! A terrible wrong is being righted- a miscarriage of justice is corrected! — Phylicia Rashad (@PhyliciaRashad) June 30, 2021He was charged in late 2015, when a prosecutor armed with newly unsealed evidence — Cosby’s damaging deposition from her lawsuit — arrested him days before the 12-year statute of limitations expired.The trial judge had allowed just one other accuser to testify at Cosby’s first trial, when the jury deadlocked. However, he then allowed five other accusers to testify at the retrial about their experiences with Cosby in the 1980s.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said that testimony tainted the trial, even though a lower appeals court had found it appropriate to show a signature pattern of drugging and molesting women.Cosby was the first celebrity tried and convicted in the #MeToo era, so the reversal could make prosecutors wary of calling other accusers in similar cases. The law on prior bad act testimony varies by state, though, and the ruling only holds sway in Pennsylvania.Prosecutors did not immediately say if they would appeal or seek to try Cosby for a third time.The justices voiced concern not just about sex assault cases, but what they saw as the judiciary’s increasing tendency to allow testimony that crosses the line into character attacks. The law allows the testimony only in limited cases, including to show a crime pattern so specific it serves to identify the perpetrator.In New York, the judge presiding over last year’s trial of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, whose case had sparked the explosion of the #MeToo movement in 2017, let four other accusers testify. Weinstein was convicted and sentenced to 23 years in prison. He is now facing separate charges in California.In Cosby’s case, one of his appellate lawyers said prosecutors put on vague evidence about the uncharged conduct, including Cosby’s own recollections in his deposition about giving women alcohol or quaaludes before sexual encounters.“The presumption of innocence just didn’t exist for him,” Jennifer Bonjean, the lawyer, argued to the court in December.In May, Cosby was denied paroled after refusing to participate in sex offender programs during his nearly three years in state prison. He has long said he would resist the treatment programs and refuse to acknowledge wrongdoing even if it means serving the full 10-year sentence.This is the first year he was eligible for parole under the three- to 10-year sentence handed down after his 2018 conviction.Cosby spokesperson Andrew Wyatt called the parole board decision “appalling.”Prosecutors said Cosby repeatedly used his fame and “family man” persona to manipulate young women, holding himself out as a mentor before betraying them.Cosby, a groundbreaking Black actor who grew up in public housing in Philadelphia, made a fortune estimated at $400 million during his 50 years in the entertainment industry. His trademark clean comedy and homespun wisdom fueled popular TV shows, books and standup acts.He fell from favor in his later years as he lectured the Black community about family values, but was attempting a comeback when he was arrested.“There was a built-in level of trust because of his status in the entertainment industry and because he held himself out as a public moralist,” Assistant District Attorney Adrienne Jappe, of suburban Montgomery County, argued to the justices.Cosby had invited Constand to an estate he owns in Pennsylvania the night she said he drugged and sexually assaulted her.Constand, a former professional basketball player who worked at his alma mater, went to police a year later. The other accusers knew Cosby through the entertainment industry and did not go to police.CBS3’s Joe Holden, Natasha Brown and Alexandria Hoff contributed to this report.Copyright 2021 by The Associated Press.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — James Franco and his co-defendants agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit alleging he intimidated students at an acting and film school he founded into gratuitous and exploitative sexual situations, court filings made public Wednesday showed. The two sides first reached a deal to settle the class-action suit in February, but it took several months to resolve details, and the dollar amount was not previously disclosed. “While Defendants continue to deny the allegations in the Complaint, they acknowledge that Plaintiffs have raised important issues; and all parties strongly believe that now is a critical time to focus on addressing the mistreatment of women in Hollywood,” the statement said. “All agree on the need to make sure that no one in the entertainment industry — regardless of sex, race, religion, disability, ethnicity, background, gender or sexual orientation — faces discrimination, harassment or prejudice of any kind.”It alleged that Franco “sought to create a pipeline of young women who were subjected to his personal and professional sexual exploitation in the name of education,” and that students were led to believe roles in Franco’s films would be available to those who went along.Franco’s production company Rabbit Bandini and his partners including Vince Jolivette and Jay Davis were also named as defendants.The settlement includes “non-economic” terms that have not been made public. It has been submitted to a Los Angeles judge for approval. Before filing the lawsuit, Tither-Kaplan aired her allegations of sexual misconduct against Franco along with other women in the Los Angeles Times after Franco won a Golden Globe Award for “The Disaster Artist” in early 2018, when the wave of the #MeToo movement was first sweeping across Hollywood.The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been sexually abused, but often will if they come forward publicly.

"SpaceX launches second dedicated rideshare mission - SpaceNews
WASHINGTON — SpaceX launched 88 satellites on a Falcon 9 June 30 on the company’s second dedicated smallsat rideshare mission.The Falcon 9 lifted off from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:31 p.m. Eastern, more than halfway into a nearly hourlong launch window because of weather. A launch attempt the day before was scrubbed .Deployment of the payload of 88 satellites started nearly 58 minutes after liftoff, once the upper stage performed a second burn of its engine to place it into a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of nearly 550 kilometers. The satellites, from a variety of government and commercial customers, were released over half an hour.The mission, named Transporter-2 by SpaceX, was the company’s second dedicated smallsat rideshare mission, . The earlier flight carried 143 satellites, but SpaceX said the total payload mass for Transporter-2 was greater than that of Transporter-1. The company did not disclose specific payload mass figures for either mission.SpaceX established its smallsat rideshare program nearly two years ago, offering low-cost launches on dedicated Falcon 9 missions like Transporter-2 as well as on launches of its Starlink satellites. It has attracted significant interest from both companies and government agencies.The Transporter-2 payload manifest featured synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites from three competing companies: Capella, Iceye and Umbra. HawkEye 360 and Kleos, two companies deploying constellations to perform radio-frequency tracking, each had satellites on this mission, as did PlanetIQ and Spire, which collect GPS radio occultation data for use in weather forecasting.The . Two Mandrake-2 satellites — originally intended to launch on Transporter-1 before being damaged in prelaunch processing — feature optical crosslinks and will be used to test technologies for future low Earth orbit military satellite. Two cubesats built by General Atomics will also test optical communications between satellites and with drones. SDA has a fifth payload on Loft Orbital’s YAM-3 satellite.NASA flew two smallsats on Transporter-2, including a pathfinder for a cubesat constellation called TROPICS, for Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats. TROPICS Pathfinder is identical to the six TROPICS satellites that Astra will launch on its Rocket 3 small launch vehicle in 2022 and will enable full testing of the satellite design in advance of the deployment of the constellation.Many of the customers worked with launch services providers such as D-Orbit, Exolaunch and Spaceflight. That included two Sherpa tugs from Spaceflight on this launch, one of which has electric propulsion from Apollo Fusion.Launch cadence and reusabilityTransporter-2 was SpaceX’s 20th Falcon 9 mission of the year, with six months yet to go. In only two years has SpaceX conducted more orbital launches: 21 in 2018 and 26 in 2020. The company is on track to shatter the record set last year, even with an anticipated slowdown of launches in July and August.A key factor in that high launch cadence is reusability. The Falcon 9 booster used for Transporter-2 was making its eighth flight, concluding with a landing at Cape Canaveral’s Landing Zone 1. Its first launch was exactly one year ago, when it launched a GPS 3 satellite, and was also used for launching Turksat 5A and five Starlink missions before Transporter-2. Other Falcon 9 boosters have flown up to 10 times.While SpaceX previously set a goal of 10 flights per booster, company officials have in recent months suggested those boosters could fly more than 10 times. “We’ve got boosters now that have flown 10 times, and some that are slated to fly 20 or possibly 30 times,” Elon Musk, founder and chief executive of SpaceX, said in a June 29 appearance at the Mobile World Congress.“With Falcon 9, we’ve achieved I think the most efficient reusability of any rocket to date,” he said, but added that SpaceX will take reusability “to another level” with its Starship vehicle. That vehicle, whose first orbital launch Musk now says will take place in the “next few months,” is intended to be reflown without any significant refurbishment, like an airliner.“The Holy Grail for rocketry is rapidly reusable reliable rockets,” he said.",https://spacenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/f9-transporter2-879x485.jpg,"Demonstration of a trapped-ion atomic clock in space - Nature.com

Such satellite systems use precise measurement of signal propagation times determined by atomic clocks, together with propagation speed, to calculate position. Although space atomic clocks with low instability are an enabling technology for global navigation, they have not yet been applied to deep space navigation and have seen only limited application to space-based fundamental physics, owing to performance constraints imposed by the rigours of space operation7. Methods of electromagnetically trapping and cooling ions have revolutionized atomic clock performance8,9,10,11,12,13. Terrestrial trapped-ion clocks operating in the optical domain have achieved orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance over their predecessors and have become a key component in national metrology laboratory research programmes13, but transporting this new technology into space has remained challenging. Here we show the results from a trapped-ion atomic clock operating in space. On the ground, NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock demonstrated a short-term fractional frequency stability of 1.5 × 10−13/τ1/2 (where τ is the averaging time)14. Launched in 2019, the clock has operated for more than 12 months in space and demonstrated there a long-term stability of 3 × 10−15 at 23 days (no drift removal), and an estimated drift of 3.0(0.7) × 10−16 per day. Each of these exceeds current space clock performance by up to an order of magnitude15,16,17. The Deep Space Atomic Clock is particularly amenable to the space environment because of its low sensitivity to variations in radiation, temperature and magnetic fields. This level of space clock performance will enable one-way navigation in which signal delay times are measured in situ, making near-real-time navigation of deep space probes possible18.Full data for Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 3 are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.These authors contributed equally: Eric A.

In what could be a considered a celestial version of ""Pac-Man,"" scientists have detected black holes gobbling up neutron stars — marking the observation of collisions between the two most extreme objects in the universe for the very first time.And the hefty feasts occurred one billion years ago.Within a 10-day time frame, a team of over 1,000 international scientists spotted the rare cosmic event twice using the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory in the U.S. and the Virgo gravitational-wave observatory in Italy, They published their findings, originally documented in January 2020, on Tuesday in . While researchers have  in the past, this is the first time one has been confirmed. Ecstatic researchers say the observations of the death spiral and merger of neutron stars and black holes will help ""unlock some of the most complex mysteries of the universe,"" including the building blocks of matter and the nature of the space-time continuum.Co-author Susan Scott said that, although the collisions occurred about a billion years ago, they were so massive that their gravitational waves — ripples in space-time that shake the entire universe — have only just finished traveling at least 900 million light years to reach Earth. ""These collisions have shaken the universe to its core and we've detected the ripples they have sent hurtling through the cosmos,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. ""Each collision isn't just the coming together of two massive and dense objects. It's really like Pac-Man, with a black hole swallowing its companion neutron star whole.""  Ahead of the collision and merger, the two massive objects, both the corpses of massive dead stars, orbit each other at around half the speed of light. During the newly-captured collision, the neutron star is warped and deformed as it nears the black hole, which becomes more massive as it swallows the star whole. In one instance, a black hole with a mass nine times that of our sun swallowed up a neutron star with a mass around twice that of the sun. The other event involved a black hole with a mass about six times bigger than the sun snacking on a neutron star about 1.5 times the sun's mass. All of the mass of a neutron star is squeezed into an extremely dense star, which is about the size of a city. Scientists say that one teaspoon of a neutron star weighs as much as all of humanity.Astronomers searched the sky for flashes of light that may have resulted from the events, but none were found, possibly due to their distance from Earth. Additionally, the black holes in these cases were large enough to swallow the entirety of the neutron stars, leaving behind no light to detect. ""These were not events where the black holes munched on the neutron stars like the cookie monster and flung bits and pieces about,"" said co-author Patrick Brady. ""That 'flinging about' is what would produce light, and we don't think that happened in these cases.""Scientists have previously captured two black holes smashing together and the collision of two neutron stars — but they ""have waiting a very long time"" to witness the two come together. ""Now, we've completed the last piece of the puzzle with the first confirmed observations of gravitational waves from a black hole and a neutron star colliding,"" Scott said.Astronomers have spent decades hunting for this sort of event in the Milky Way galaxy, but have yet to find any. ""With this new discovery of neutron star-black hole mergers outside our galaxy, we have found the missing type of binary,"" co-author Astrid Lamberts said. ""We can finally begin to understand how many of these systems exist, how often they merge, and why we have not yet seen examples in the Milky Way."" ""These kind of detections are incredibly rare,"" said co-author Johannes Eichholz. ""We haven't detected these events once — but twice and within 10 days of each other. ""Like the ripples from these two events, which have been felt a billion years later, these findings will have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe for many years to come.""",https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/06/30/7ca9b173-724a-408c-b7d2-886e8c4024e3/thumbnail/620x349/194dddfe167ff92db99fa16ebe874dc6/nsbh-merger-graphic-2021-carl-knox-ozgrav-swinburne-web.jpg#
"Google adds support for virtual COVID-19 vaccine cards on Android devices - Engadget
Google has updated its Pay app's ""Passes API"" to enable a simple way to store and display a digital card on Android showing users' COVID-19 test and vaccination details. The tech giant has given healthcare organizations, government agencies, as well as organizations authorized by public health authorities to distribute COVID vaccines access to the API. That means their developers can now easily create digital COVID vaccine and test cards that users can store on their device. As 9to5Google notes, Passes is a Google Pay API used to store non-payment cards like retailer membership cards. However, there's no need for users to download the Pay app if they don't have it to be able to store the COVID digital cards created using the Passes API. Once they get the digital card, they'll be able to access it via a shortcut on their home screen even without an internet connection. That said, their devices must run Android 5 or later.In the interest of assuaging users' privacy fears, Google says it doesn't retain a copy of people's COVID-19 vaccine and test information. The company also says it doesn't share data on the card with third party services and that it doesn't use the information for ad targeting. Users can show the card to anybody they want, of course, though they'll be required to have a lock screen on their device before they can store the card for their own safety. The Passes API update is only available in the US at the moment, but the tech giant promises that it will also roll out to other countries in the future. ",https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KrjcPZT2jpJVh_OjAwLHbQ--~B/aD0xMDQwO3c9MTYwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/83903600-da2a-11eb-8ddf-e407024d76e3.cf.jpg,"AT&T sets Google Messages as default SMS app for all its Android phones - GSMArena.com news - GSMArena.com

As of now, Verizon continues to pre-load its self-branded Messages+ app as the defaultThis solidifies RCS in a world where Android users are just finally able to have a Messaging experience closer to Apple’s robust iMessage. Apple has not commented on whether iPhones will ever support RCS messaging. If Apple were to support RCS, it threatens the closely-knit ecosystem that iMessage holds between Apple users that keeps them from wanting to leave. On the other hand, SMS is an insecure and outdated protocol that may compromise Apple’s focus on privacy.

"Spectator to be sued after Tour de France crash - FRANCE 24
The roadside fan who caused a giant crash at the Tour de France on Saturday is to be sued by the organisers.The woman concerned held up a banner slightly into the road and was looking straight at the television motorbike cameras with her back turned on the speeding peloton.German rider Tony Martin brushed past her and was knocked off balance racing near the head of the peloton, and when he fell it caused a horrifying domino effect ending in a tangle of bikes and bodies.DSM's German rider Jasha Sutterlin was the only one who had to pull out at that moment but several people were hurt, including spectators.""We are suing this woman who behaved so badly,"" Tour deputy director Pierre-Yves Thouault told AFP.""We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this dont spoil the show for everyone,"" he said.Italian champion Sonny Colbrelli and Dutch rider Wout van Aert, who ran over Martin before falling head over heels, had both been amongst the favourites to win the first stage hilltop finish but were both badly delayed.Two Ineos riders Richie Porte and Tao Geoghegan Hart both lost time, while champion Tadej Pogacar saw his right hand man Marc Hirschi badly hurt.According to regional newspaper Ouest France the woman who was wearing a yellow jacket fled the scene and has yet to be found.",https://s.france24.com/media/display/83aae53a-d6a7-11eb-bd18-005056bfd1d9/w:310/p:16x9/1dd839eb3b9542f5903fa898d0388861971f6eb6.jpg
