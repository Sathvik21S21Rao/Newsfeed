"Stock Market Live Updates: Sensex falls 164 points, Nifty ends below 15,700; IT stocks drag; auto, pharma outp - CNBCTV18
Thank you, readers! That's all from CNBC-TV18.com's live market coverage today. Please do log in again tomorrow for another day of market coverage. Stay Safe!Ajit Mishra, VP - Research, Religare BrokingMarkets traded lacklustre and ended marginally lower following subdued global cues. After the flat start, the benchmark traded range-bound till the end however the bias slightly on the negative side. Markets are closely eyeing the global indices for some signal as indications are mixed from the domestic front. Nifty has been hovering within the 15,450-15,900 zone for almost a month now and currently trading in the middle of the band. A breakdown below 15,650 would pave the way for a further slide towards the lower range. We feel it’s prudent to keep a check on positions and prefer defensive in the current scenario.Sugandha Sachdeva, VP- Commodity & Currency Research, Religare BrokingThe Indian rupee has drifted lower to test three-month lows as the domestic equities witnessed selling pressure and the greenback continues to strengthen, hitting a three-month high. The gradual uptick in crude oil prices wherein they are trading at their highest in two years is also acting as a headwind for the domestic currency. Besides, sentiments have also taken a beating due to a drop in domestic manufacturing PMI in June, reflecting the impact of the second wave of the virus even as it subsides, enabling the recovery to get back on track. The near-term bias is negative, but the markets are now eyeing key US jobs report for June to assess the Fed's stance going ahead, amid the chatter surrounding the taper-tantrum.Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak SecuritiesNifty remained sluggish throughout the day and gradually declined to the level of 15,667. Thursday's fall was led by the decline in technology, banks and commodities, which have a large weight in the index. Volatility is declining, which is a sign that bulls are resting and they could bring volatility to the market. India VIX closed at 12.63, the lowest level in the last 18 months. On a monthly basis, the market remained in the narrow range of 500 points, which is an unusual and even narrow trading range over the last six months. Long traders need to be careful when adding long positions at high levels and such markets invite unpleasant events. For the day, the Nifty closed below the levels of 15,700 and on Friday, we may see the market hitting the lower boundary which is between 15,650 and 15,600 levels. Our strategy should be to buy on dips that is between 15,670-16,620. Keep a final stop loss at 15,550 levels. On the higher side, 15,700-15,745 and 15,800 would be major obstacles.Nagaraj Shetti, Technical Research Analyst, HDFC SecuritiesNifty continued to show choppy movement with negative bias and still, there is no evidence of any upside bounce emerging from the lows. Nifty is currently placed at the important cluster support of 15,650 levels and a move below this area could result in a slide down to 15,500 levels.Manish Shah, Founder, www.Niftytriggers.comNifty had another flat day as it closed lower by around 30 odd points. For the fourth day in a row, Nifty closed with a red candle. We have not seen a range expansion candle in this four-day decline as the daily range of the candles is just below the average. We interpret this as a time correction of the April to June rally. The entire price action for the month of June can be considered as a rectangle which is a trend continuation pattern.Nifty is still at the support of a rising trendline and the pattern of higher highs and higher lows remains intact. Nifty has dipped below the rising 20 days moving average. Four days in a row of red candles means that Nifty is getting oversold on a very stochastic oscillator. Support for Nifty is now at 15,600-15,625. What we need is a bullish candle stock pattern which would at least give a short-term rally.  What we need is to move above 15,750 to propel Nifty towards 15,900-15,950.Manish Hathiramani, Proprietary Index Trader and Technical Analyst, Deen Dayal InvestmentsThe markets have been sideways all day long and the volumes have been lackluster. Until 15,900 is not taken out or 15,400 is not broken, we will continue trading in a choppy manner with no definite sense of direction.Market At Close | IT Stocks Slip Despite Rupee Being Weak Against $; Nifty IT Down 0.6%Market At Close | Market Closes Lower After A Range-Bound SessionRupee At Close | The Indian rupee ended 23 paise lower at 74.55 per dollar, amid selling in the domestic equity market.

On the other hand, there could be a correction in Chinese steel prices and so the price of steel in India could correct in line with that. Moreover, there has been a correction in export prices for India and that could reflect in a lower price for steel. On the domestic front as well, India is entering into seasonally week months, which could put further pressure on steel prices. The secondary steel makers are sitting on higher inventories.

The longer-term cycle of commodities will unfold a little later and we will know how supply is behaving post environmental, social, and governance (ESG) environment, so this is something we would tackle at a later date,” he said. On auto space, Badshah said, “What is more important as far as autos are concerned is their ability to restore or support or control their margins and that is where there is a worry. But since commodity prices are holding up or not going up any further from here, maybe the ability of a lot of these auto companies to restore some part of their margin losses could also come. Therefore, the trend for the auto sector could look better, compared to what it has been in the recent past.” Badshah also said that urban demand for autos could outstrip rural demand.

India's manufacturing sector activities contracted for the first time in 11 months in June as rise in coronavirus cases and strict containment measures adversely impacted demand as well as resulted in job losses.According to the monthly IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) survey released on July 1, manufacturing PMI stood at 48.1 in June, down from the ten-month low of 50.8 in May.The index fell below the critical 50.0 mark for the first time since July 2020. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion while a score below 50 denotes contraction.The poor domestic demand condition had been held responsible for the poor performance of the sector in the previous month of May. The slight growth in May was mostly contributed by foreign export orders, IHS Markit had said.As production further tumbled in June and finances remained stressed, manufacturing companies again cut jobs. This was the 15th straight month of job losses in a row.The latest reading highlighted renewed contractions in factory orders, production, exports and quantities of purchases. Falling new orders, business closures and the COVID-19 crisis triggered a reduction in output among Indian manufacturers, the survey said.COVID-19 restrictions also curtailed international demand for Indian goods and new export orders decreased for the first time in ten months.""The intensification of the COVID-19 crisis in India had a detrimental impact on the manufacturing economy. Growth of new orders, production, exports and input purchasing was interrupted in June as containment measures aimed at bringing the pandemic under control restrained demand,"" Pollyanna De Lima, Economics Associate Director at IHS Markit, said.Lima, however, noted that in all cases, rates of contraction were softer than during the first lockdown.Business confidence was dampened in June by uncertainty over when the pandemic can be brought under control. Companies were at their least optimistic for almost a year. ""As a result of subdued optimism, jobs were shed again in June,"" Lima said.On the price front, input costs increased further in June, with firms reporting higher prices for chemicals, electronic components, energy, metals and plastics.Additional cost burdens were again transferred on to clients, with goods producers hiking their fees for the tenth straight month, the survey said.""Out of the three broad areas of the manufacturing sector monitored by the survey, capital goods was the worst affected area in June. Output here declined at a steep rate due to a sharp fall in sales.""The sector also saw the fastest contraction in buying levels and was the only to post job shedding,"" Lima said.After starting 2021 on a stronger footing than it ended 2020, the manufacturing sector has continued to lose growth momentum. While production, new orders and input buying have continued to expand, but growth has stagnated. The PMI has averaged just 51.5 in the opening quarter of fiscal year 2021/22, the lowest three-month figure since the same period one year ago.",https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/1920x1080/shutterstock_1145284904_372957.jpg
"Tokyo mom creates COVID-19 vaccination database amid information vacuum - Devdiscourse
Balancing a new software programming job and caring for a toddler in Tokyo, LaShawn Toyoda saw increasing confusion in her social media feeds among non-Japanese speakers about how they could get a COVID-19 vaccine.The 36-year-old, a former English teacher who had recently completed an intensive coding course as part of a pandemic-prompted career change, decided she had the skills to help ease concerns amid a lack of clear direction from officials. ""There was no news available in any language other than Japanese about when they would be able to get vaccinated, how they could get vaccinated or where,"" said Toyoda, who moved from Maryland in the United States to Tokyo a decade ago.""I told my husband, 'watch our daughter, I gotta make something."" Hours later, Toyoda launched her database Find a Doc https://www.findadoc.jp, a health database that helps non-Japanese speaking people find clinics with COVID-19 vaccine doses to spare after cancellations from prioritised elderly patients.The database, which went live on June 13, quickly grew from just two clinics to almost 70 with information in 19 languages. Toyoda's Twitter stream @theyokohamalife is filled with thanks and anecdotes of people who got their shots through the site, which she said has been used by more than 36,000 people.The site's popularity underscores nervousness about Japan's sluggish vaccination rollout, particularly in Tokyo, where the Olympics Games are due to begin in less than a month. Just 23% of the population have received at least one dose, according to a Reuters tracker, one of the lowest levels among major economies.After a slow start with limited supplies prioritising medical workers and older people, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to have the elderly population fully vaccinated by the end of this month and all other adults by November. To speed up the process, the government handed over more control to municipalities and companies to set up their own systems and centres for administering shots.That has meant that availability, particularly for the general public, has varied widely depending on where someone works and lives. Toyoda, who reskilled after the school she was teaching at part time shut down during a state of emergency in the capital last year, booked her own first shot through a clinic on her database last week.The site has received wide support, with more experienced programmers from Alphabet Inc's Google, Mercari Inc and Amazon.com Inc volunteering to add features and make it more secure. The combined efforts echo online community activism in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster when there was a similar perceived vacuum of official information.""We take for granted that government will do everything and anything. No they won't,"" said Pieter Franken, who co-founded volunteer group SafeCast, which began by collecting radiation readings around Japan but has since expanded into tracking air quality and other quality-of-life factors.

New Delhi, July 01 (ANI): A new study by researchers at Penn State College of Medicine indicated that people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are more likely to have suicidal thoughts and die from suicide. The findings of the study were published in the journal 'General Psychiatry'. The researchers said that despite significant medical advancements related to HIV treatment and patients' quality of life, the risk of suicide in these patients is high and health care providers should prioritise mental health screenings in this population. According to the World Health Organization, roughly 800,000 people worldwide die from suicide annually. Among members of the general population who have suicidal thoughts, one out of three will attempt suicide. Out of 286 suicide attempts, one will result in death. Results from a College of Medicine study suggest that for every two people living with HIV/AIDS who have suicidal thoughts, one person will attempt suicide. Among this population, out of 13 suicide attempts, one will result in death. Analysing data from more than 185,000 adults living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, the researchers examined risk factors and incidences of attempted and completed suicides among this population. They found that not only is suicidal ideation higher, but people living with HIV/AIDS were 100 times more likely to die by suicide compared to the general population. ""There is an urgent need to prioritize mental health screening and care into all HIV testing and treatment settings,"" said Dr Paddy Ssentongo, researcher and an epidemiology doctoral student.""Suicide risk should be assessed in all HIV patients, especially in those who are newly-diagnosed and those with advanced disease,"" added Ssentongo. According to the findings, people living with HIV/AIDS in North America are 50 times more likely to commit suicide compared to those living in Europe. Similarly, North America, South America and Australia have the highest rates of suicide attempts in people living with HIV/AIDS. The researchers also found that the risk of suicide was high for both newly diagnosed individuals and those whose illness progressed to AIDS.",https://images.everydayhealth.com/homepage/health-topics-2.jpg?sfvrsn=757370ae_2,"COVID-19: Chaos at vaccination centres in Ahmedabad due to crowding amid short supply - Devdiscourse
Chaotic scenes were witnessed at several COVID-19 inoculation centers in Ahmedabad on Wednesday as people turned up in large numbers to take the jabs amid a short supply of vaccines in Gujarat city.The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) struggled to meet its target of vaccinating one lakh people per day due to less number of vaccines supplied to it, officials said. At many vaccination centers in Ahmedabad, especially in the city's eastern parts, people queued up since early morning to avail tokens for vaccination which were being distributed in limited numbers. Many centers even put up boards saying the 'Covishield' vaccine was not available.A beneficiary at Bodakdev urban health center here said, ''I came early in the morning so that I could get a token for the vaccine. They gave tokens to only 100 people. I came for the second day today and was fortunate to get the token.'' Long queues were also seen at other vaccination centers in localities like Khokhra, Amraiwari, Vastral, with people turning up since early morning to get vaccinated.The AMC on June 20 said it had set a target of vaccinating one lakh people per day, after the state government launched the facility of spot registration.However, from June 21 to 29, it failed to even cross the 50,000-mark, officials said.As per the vaccination data shared by the AMC, on June 21, 38,311 people were vaccinated in the city. The vaccination figures for the next eight days were 39,541, 41,887, 41,390, 33,355, 27,509, 20,158, 22,506, and 25,289.AMC's medical officer Bhavin Solanki said, ''We are getting less supply of vaccines, but we are vaccinating people depending upon the supply, that varies every day. Like yesterday, we received 35,000 doses. Some days we receive 20,000 doses or even 13,000 doses.'' A similar situation was witnessed at some centers in Rajkot. People complained of irregularities and lack of a proper system for vaccination due to which they were unable to get inoculated. In Sabarkantha, several centers put up boards saying no vaccination will be carried out until they receive a supply of vaccines.The Gujarat government on Tuesday said 40 percent of the eligible population in the state has already received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.The COVID-19 vaccination drive was rolled out in Gujarat along with other states on January 16 this year. From May 1, Gujarat launched the drive to vaccinate people in the age group of 18-44 years in phases before expanding it across the state.On Tuesday, Gujarat reported 93 new COVID-19 cases, the second straight day of the under-100 daily count, taking the coronavirus tally to 8,23,433, while 326 patients recovered from the infection, as per the state health department.

NEW DELHI, June 29: The Union Health Ministry has prepared a fact-sheet to guide frontline workers and vaccinators on counselling pregnant women about the value and precautions of the COVID-19 vaccine so that they can make an informed decision.
Although more than 90 per cent infected pregnant women recover without any need for hospitalisation, rapid deterioration in health may occur in a few and that might affect the foetus also, the document said.
“It is, therefore, advised that a pregnant woman should take COVID-19 vaccine,” it said.
However, pregnancy does not increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, the document stressed.
Symptomatic pregnant women appear to be at an increased risk of severe disease and death. In case of severe disease, like all other patients, pregnant women shall also need hospitalisation.
Pregnant women with underlying medical conditions like high blood pressure, obesity, age over 35 years are at a higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19, the fact sheet said.
According to the document, a frontline worker or a vaccinator needs to counsel pregnant women about the availability, value and precautions of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“This note provides you with the information that you need to educate and support pregnant women so that they can make an informed decision about getting the COVID-19 vaccine,” the note said .
The note is structured in the form of questions-answers to make it easier for frontline workers to inform pregnant women and their families about the most important issues related to COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant women.
The note stated that over 95 per cent newborns of COVID-19 positive mothers have been in good condition at birth.
In some cases, COVID-19 infections in pregnancy may increase the possibility of premature delivery, the baby’s weight might be less than 2.5 kg and in rare situations, the baby might die before birth, it said.
It said pregnant women, older than 35 years of age, obese, having a pre-existing illness such as diabetes or high blood pressure and having a history of clotting in the limbs are at a higher risk of developing complications after COVID-19 infection.
In case a woman has been infected with COVID-19 during the current pregnancy, then she should be vaccinated soon after the delivery, the document stated. On the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines, the fact-sheet stated that the COVID-19 vaccines available are safe and vaccination protects pregnant women against COVID-19 illness/disease like other individuals. Like any medicine, a vaccine may have side effects which are normally mild. After getting the vaccine injection, a pregnant woman can get mild fever, pain at the injection site or feel unwell for 1-3 days. The long-term adverse effects and safety of the vaccine for foetus and child is not established yet.
“Very rarely (one in 1-5 lakh persons), the pregnant women may experience some symptoms within 20 days after getting the COVID-19 vaccination which may require immediate attention,” it said.
Symptoms occurring within 20 days after receiving any COVID-19 vaccine may include shortness of breath (difficulty in breathing), persistent abdominal pain with or without vomiting , pain in limbs/pain on pressing limbs or swelling in the limb, small pinpoint haemorrhages or bruising of skin beyond the injection site, weakness/paralysis of limbs or any particular side of the body, severe and persistent headaches with or without vomiting (in absence of history of migraine or chronic headache)
Seizures with or without vomiting (in the absence of previous history of seizures) among others are possible.
In order to protect themselves and those around from spreading the COVID-19 infection, pregnant woman and her family members should practice COVID-19 appropriate behaviour like wearing a double mask, practising frequent hand hygiene and maintaining physical distance and avoid crowded places. (PTI)
All pregnant women need to register themselves on the Co-WIN portal or may get themselves registered on-site at the COVID-19 vaccination centre.

"Meezaan Jaffrey on his relationship with Navya Naveli: ‘My parents had started to give me looks’ - The Indian Express
Javed Jaffrey’s son and actor Meezaan Jaffrey, who made his debut in 2019 with the romantic drama Malaal, has often been questioned about the nature of his relationship with Amitabh Bachchan’s granddaughter Navya Naveli Nanda. And in a recent interview with ETimes, the artiste spoke up about their bond.Stating that he and Navya are nothing but buddies, the actor stated, “Navya and I are really close friends, and I think because of me, her name has come up in a lot of places and that’s unfair, you know. It is her privacy and her private life and it’s unfair to be talking about someone at this point in time. And she is just a friend of mine if you are asking about what is going on. Our families have known each other for a long time because we have been in the industry for so long.”Meezaan then went on to clarify how he came to be friends with Navya in the first place. The actor said that he knows her through his sister, “She is best friends with my sister, and they are both studying in New York. Well, they are both back now in Mumbai.”Meezaan also added that it was weird to enter both Navya’s and his own house when the speculations about their relationship first started doing the rounds, but concluded that everything is ‘fine’ now — “It was awkward to visit her (Navya) in Jalsa, and it was awkward to visit my own house as my parents had started to give me looks. It was a little difficult in the beginning, but I think we are fine now.”On the work front, Meezaan is looking forward to the release of his second movie, Hungama 2.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2021/07/meezaan1200.jpg,"Taapsee Pannu reacts to criticism of Kareena Kapoor charging Rs. 12 crore to play Sita; says it’s a sign of ingrained sexism - Bollywood Hungama

But does it still hold up? - The Indian Express
Ten years ago, when Delhi Belly released in theatres, it left the urban youngsters in awe. This was the film they wanted to see when Bollywood was presenting them with Ready and Bodyguard. While Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara gave them an aspirational tour of Spain, Delhi Belly gave them a look at how ‘cool’ could be interpreted in Hindi cinema. The syntax of this Abhinay Deo directorial felt closer to the urban youth of 2011 and was something they really wanted to relate to, instead of the over-the-top dialogue-baazi they got in Singham that had taken the nation by storm.Starring Imran Khan, Vir Das, Kunaal Roy Kapur, Vijay Raaz, Poorna Jagannathan and Shenaz Treasury, Delhi Belly was written by Akshat Verma and produced by Aamir Khan in an era when Imran was the promising upcoming hero, despite Luck and I Hate Luv Storys, and Vijay was best known for that kauwa biryani scene in the much-lesser known Run. The film was probably a re-launch vehicle for Imran but it was Vijay who flew with it.Memes from Delhi Belly are still a part of our cultural zeitgeist but what was it about this film that clicked with the audience back then? And does it still hold?To recap, Delhi Belly is a comedy of errors where a package with diamonds is delivered to the wrong place and the gangster-owners of the diamonds start going after everyone who could have the package. Enter Imran, Vir and Kunal’s characters who are accidental bystanders to this mess but have to now find a way to outrun the gangster and stay alive. Poorna Jagannathan and Shenaz Treasury are along for the ride as well.One of the biggest plus points of Delhi Belly was its music. Ram Sampath’s excellent and catchy tunes might have created some controversies (with Bhaag DK Bose) but tracks like Bedardi Raja, I Hate You Like I Love You and Switty Tera Pyaar are such zingers and flow with the film quite perfectly.The film’s dialogue was another one of its controversial points. The traditionalists believed that the expletives were unnecessary but the youth called it colloquial. Living in an OTT era where some of the shows’  dialogues aren’t even half as sanitary, Delhi Belly’s dialogues don’t sound objectionable one bit today but they do sound extremely forced. Most cuss words feel like they were forcefully added to up the ‘cool quotient’ and the makers could have probably done away with most of them.As far as its comedic appeal is concerned, the film does not feel as humorous as it did the first time. The extended gag about Nitin’s diarrhea and Sonia being too silly to be a mule can be chuckle-worthy moments but the impact isn’t as strong anymore.In hindsight, it feels like Aamir Khan produced this film to reinvigorate Imran’s career and he delivered. Imran was thoroughly impressive here and it was evident that he was capable of doing much more if he had maybe picked subjects that weren’t as traditional as his other roles. In fact, this was possibly the best film of his short-lived acting career which makes us think that in a different era, with some different choices, Imran would have probably found his calling as an actor.Watching Delhi Belly in 2021 doesn’t leave you awestruck and that’s mainly because that the mainstream Hindi film industry isn’t playing just to the traditional gallery anymore and we are watching more of these experimental films in this day and age. Of course, there are hero-centric formulaic films today as well but with the emergence of OTT platforms and the ever-changing rules of cinema, Delhi Belly seems like a film that probably encouraged others to take the plunge into a territory that wasn’t as accepted back then.

"Elon Musks SpaceX launches 88 satellites as part of ride-share mission - Business Standard
https://mybs.in/2ZfnhQW
	Tech billionaire Elon Musk's space company Spacex has launched 88 satellites, as part of the firm's second in-house ""ride-share"" mission from Florida, bringing the total number of orbital objects this year to nearly 900, the media reported.
	The company launched the satellites on Wednesday on a reused Falcon 9 rocket for the ""Transporter-2"" mission, including the first five for a new Pentagon agency and dozens more for various companies, countries, and schools, the Verge reported.





	On Wednesday, June 30 at 3:31 p.m. EDT, Falcon 9 launched the Transporter-2, SpaceX's second dedicated SmallSat Rideshare Programme mission, from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, the company said.

	The mission also marked SpaceX's second launch to a polar orbit from Florida. This marked the company's 20th launch this year and the eighth flight for the rocket's first stage booster. That booster returned to Earth about 10 minutes later at SpaceX's Landing Zone 1.

	On board this launch were 85 commercial and government spacecraft (including CubeSats, microsats, and orbital transfer vehicles) and three Starlink satellites.

	The Transporter-1 mission, in January this year, set up a new record for most satellites -- it sent up 143 satellites. The Transporter-2 mission, however, launched more mass to orbit overall,the company said.

	The Transporter launches, first announced in 2019, are part of the company's rideshare business model.

	The Transporter-2 mission includes nearly 10 customers, some of whom are launch service providers who are themselves organizing customer payloads -- like Spaceflight, which is launching 36 small satellites on behalf of 14 customers, as well as its electric propulsion vehicle dubbed Sherpa-LTE, the TechCrunch reported.

	It also includes the first satellite launch for space intelligence company Umbra and Loft Orbital's ""rideshare"" satellites, YAM-2 and YAM-3, each of which are equipped with five independent sensors for separate customers, it added.

	Originally scheduled for June 29, the launch was halted after a rotary aircraft entered the flight zone. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk in a tweet blasted the Federal Aviation Administration's regulations as ""broken"".

	""Unfortunately, launch is called off for today, as an aircraft entered the ""keep out zone"", which is unreasonably gigantic,"" Musk tweeted.

	""There is simply no way that humanity can become a spacefaring civilization without major regulatory reform. The current regulatory system is broken,""he added.

 Jump to navigationIn a bid to improve navigation for robotic explorers and GPS satellite operations, the work on a Deep Space Atomic Clock has reached a crucial milestone. Scientists have now managed to stabilise the clock in space, reaching more than 10 times the stability of current space-based atomic clocks being used on GPS satellites.Scientists have said that atomic clocks are essential for deep space exploration and global navigation satellite systems. They have now improved the ability of space-based atomic clocks to measure time consistently over longer periods.The progress was reported in a paper , which stated that although space atomic clocks with low instability were an enabling technology for global navigation, they have not yet been applied to deep space navigation. So far, they have seen only limited application owing to performance constraints imposed by the rigours of space operation.Also Read: Atomic clocks are used to measure the distance between two objects in space by measuring very stable and precise frequencies of light emitted by specific atoms. These clocks remain ultra-stable for decades, however, their design is too bulky, power-hungry and sensitive to environmental variations. Due to their enormity, they have to be condensed for spaceflight operations and deep space explorations.The Deep Space Atomic Clock is a serious upgrade to the that enable the GPS on our phones. This new technology can make spacecraft navigation to distant locations like Mars more autonomous. Atomic clocks used onboard GPS satellites that orbit the Earth need updates two times per day to correct the clocks' natural drift from ground-based atomic clocks.Clocks are used to determine the location and heading of a spacecraft from Earth. Navigators send a signal to the spacecraft, which then returns it to Earth. The time the signal requires to make that two-way journey reveals the spacecraft's distance from Earth.According to Nasa, navigators calculate the trajectory and destination of a spacecraft by sending these multiple signals and in a bid to know the spacecraft's position within a meter, navigators need clocks with precision time resolution — clocks that can measure billionths of a second.Also Read: “As a general rule, an uncertainty of one nanosecond in time corresponds to a distance uncertainty of about one foot,” Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) quoted Eric Burt, an atomic clock physicist as saying.Currently, engineers use refrigerator-sized atomic clocks on the ground to log the timing of those signals. However, for robots on Mars or more distant destinations, waiting for the signals to make the trip can quickly add up to tens of minutes or even hours. This time lag can be significantly reduced if spacecraft carried atomic clocks and are able to calculate their own position and direction. Therefore, their stability is of utmost importance.""The stability and subsequent time delay reported in the new paper is about five times better than what the team reported in 2020. This does not represent an improvement in the clock itself but in the team’s measurement of the clock’s stability,"" JPL said.The work of the Deep Space Atomic Clock, which has been operating aboard General Atomic’s Orbital Test Bed spacecraft since June 2019, will conclude in August. NASA has announced that the Deep Space Atomic Clock-2, an improved version of the cutting-edge timekeeper, will fly on the recently announced VERITAS mission to Venus.Click here for IndiaToday.in’s ",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/../sites/all/themes/itg/images/itg_image370x208.jpg,"Mysterious methane detections on Mars baffle NASA scientists - WION

                                  NASA scientists said Curiosity found periodic bursts of methane, a gas that on Earth is strongly tied to life, in the atmosphere around its landing site in the red planet’s Gale CraterMethane in the Martian atmosphere and organic chemicals in the red planet’s soil are the latest tantalising findings of NASA’s Mars Curiosity rover as it hunts for clues about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.NASA scientists said Curiosity found periodic bursts of methane, a gas that on Earth is strongly tied to life, in the atmosphere around its landing site in the red planet’s Gale Crater.The rover also has found organic chemicals in the Martian soil, the scientists said at a webcast press conference at the American Geophyscial Union conference in San Francisco.

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California issued a press release saying the rover measured “a tenfold spike” in methane in the atmosphere around it, and detected other organic molecules in a sample collected by a robotic drill.
“There are many possible sources, biological or non-biological, such as interaction of water and rock,” Sushil Atreya of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, a member of the Curiosity rover science team, said in the press release.
The latest findings combine more than two years of data collected by the rover since its sky-crane landing inside Gale Crater in August 2012.
Last week, scientists said they had determined that billions of years ago, a lake filled the 96-mile- (154-km) wide crater being explored by Curiosity. This finding was another hint that Mars, the planet most like Earth in the solar system, was once suitable for microbial life. 
Shortly after landing, Curiosity found that Mars once had the chemical ingredients and the environmental conditions needed to support microbial life, fulfilling the primary goal of its mission.
The rover, which has traveled around 5 miles (8 kms) since landing on Mars, has been exploring an area known as Mount Sharp where rocks have been found containing water-deposited sediments, to learn if the life-friendly environments actually existed long enough for life to evolve.
“We will keep working on the puzzles these findings present,” said John Grotzinger, Curiosity project scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
Curiosity participating scientist Roger Summons of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said: “The challenge now is to find other rocks on Mount Sharp that might have different and more extensive inventories of organic compounds.”

Before any humans head back to the moon in the near future, three dummies are testing it out in NASA's Artemis 1 mission. One is a full male-bodied manikin; the other two are female-bodied torsos. The varied manikin bodies — made with materials that simulate the stuff that makes up humans, like our skin, bones, and organs — will provide scientists important, inclusive data about radiation for future Artemis astronauts in 2023 and beyond. NASA announced the name of the full manikin Tuesday: Commander Moonikin Campos. The name was chosen through a public poll that received more than 300,000 votes. The last name of Campos was picked in honor of Arturo Campos, who helped direct the Apollo 13 astronauts safely back to Earth after an oxygen tank failed on their spacecraft.Commander Moonikin Campos will be decked out in a full Orion Crew Survival System suit, the same that astronauts will wear in phases of future Artemis missions. Campos is also donning a couple of sensors to detect the amount of radiation that astronauts could encounter inside the Orion spacecraft.The female-bodied torsos, aka phantoms, were  by the German Aerospace Center and Israel Space Agency, respectively. With radiation sensors embedded throughout their bodies, they'll be testing out an AstroRad vest designed to protect astronauts' vital organs from radiation. Zohar will be wearing the vest and Helga will not, allowing scientists to determine the effectiveness of the clothing.Using female-bodied phantoms allows scientists to measure how radiation could effect women, as women tend to have a greater sensitivity to radiation than men, NASA noted in 2020. AstroRad vests have already been worn by astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) to test their fit, comfort, and mobility.NASA has historically failed women in its astronaut program, excluding them entirely in the first 19 years. Astronaut Sally Ride was the first woman selected for the agency's program, becoming the first U.S. woman to enter space in 1983. Of the 339 Americans that have been to space, just 45 have been women.The Artemis program has been touting that it will send the first woman and person of color to the moon in the coming years. Using female-bodied manikins in the Artemis 1 mission is key to creating inclusive designs and compiling inclusive data for scientists and astronauts going forward, and shows that NASA's promises aren't empty.Artemis 1, expected to launch later in 2021, will be a three-week trip around the moon and back. Artemis 2, NASA's first crewed mission to the moon since the '70s, is expected to launch in 2023 and will also circle the moon before returning to Earth.

While he did not reveal the exact purpose of the three cameras, we assume it is a combination of main, ultrawide, and telephoto. What about the selfie cameras though? Well, according to Yogesh, the main display (foldable screen) of the Galaxy Z Fold3 will have a 16MP under-display camera, whereas, the outer display will feature a 10MP sensor.Coming to the processing power, our source believes that the Galaxy Z Fold3 will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor. People were expecting the smartphone to come with the Snapdragon 888+ SoC that was announced a couple of days ago. However, it looks like Samsung won’t be able to change the chipset this late in the development stage. As for the storage, Yogesh says that the Galaxy Z Fold3 will be available with up to 512GB option. So, no upgrade in the storage department either.Earlier rumours have suggested that the Galaxy Z Fold3 could be unveiled globally on August 3rd. However, that might not be the case. According to our source, the Galaxy Z Fold3 launch will take place in the second week of August. Yogesh also reveals that the Galaxy Z Fold3 will go on sale in the US and UK sometime late in August. What about the Galaxy Z Fold3 India launch date though? Well, the tipster says that the foldable phone will be released in India in September. Hopefully, we will know more about the device as its launch nears.",https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-render-feat-1.jpg,"The Sims 4 will finally let you cook as a family - Techradar
July's The Sims 4 update will see group cooking and children's gardening abilities finally introduced in the base game. EA Maxis announced the news during a recent Inside Maxis stream, revealing that this month's update will allow Sims to cook with up to five other Sims (as long as they're on your lot). That means your Sims family can finally cook together, with children able to get involved if invited by an adult.Cooking as a group builds Sim relationships and results in better quality cooking and more servings - Sims that cook together also get a new sentiment. Maxis also revealed that while adults will gain Cooking Skill through group cooking, children will gain Mental Skill. In addition to group cooking, July's update will introduce children's gardening abilities. While children won't be able to use the Vertical Garden from The Sims 4 Eco Lifestyle Expansion Pack, they will be able to water, weed, plant, and harvest crops - if they have a high enough Mental Skill level. All children will be able to water crops, however weeding, planting and harvesting are only unlocked at certain Mental Skill levels (which haven't been confirmed just yet).Some children may prefer to get less down and dirty with the plants. Fortunately, children and toddlers will also be able to talk to plants - with toddlers potentially babbling depending on their Communication Skill.Teens, Young Adults, and Elder Sims with enough Gardening Skill will also be able to teach children about plants, increasing children's Mental and Social skills.Last but not least, The Sims 4 is also getting a brand new hairstyle, which Sim Gurus described as a ""modernized"" take on the big afro that's already available in the base gameThese additions are definitely welcome as they'll allow Sims to spend more family/friend time and reduces the restrictions on what activities children can take part in. Plus a new, more inclusive hairstyle is definitely a bonus. It's unclear when this update will roll out but we're expecting it will land as a pre-patch ahead of the release of The Sims 4 Cottage Living expansion pack on July 22.Vic is an award-winning games journalist, bringing experience from IGN, Eurogamer and more to the TechRadar table.Get the best TechRadar India deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!Thank you for signing up to .

"Switzerland, 8 European Union members approve Covishield for Green Pass - Moneycontrol
At least seven European countries including, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Greece, Iceland, Ireland and Spain, and Switzerland have approved the Covishield COVID-19 vaccine for 'Green Pass'.Separately, Estonia has also confirmed that it will recognise all vaccines authorised by the government of India for the travel of Indians to that country, the sources told PTI.Thewill be mandatory to travel to European countries and the document will serve as proof that a person is vaccinated against COVID-19.The EMA had earlier cleared only four vaccines - Comirnaty (Pfizer/BioNTech), Moderna, Vaxzervria (AstraZeneca), Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) for the green pass.Read: COVID-19 VaccineA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.The development comes a day after India asked the members of the 27-nation grouping to individually consider allowing Indians who have taken .New Delhi also conveyed to the EU member states that it will adopt a policy of reciprocity and exempt European nationals holding the 'Green Pass' from mandatory quarantine if its request to recognise Covishield and Covaxin vaccines is heeded to.Read: The European Union's Digital COVID certificate or ""Green Pass"" is set to be rolled out on July 1 with an aim to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic.Under this framework, persons who have taken vaccines authorised by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) will be exempted from travel restrictions within the EU region.",https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/15/09/33/news-636978_960_720.jpg,"Post-poll violence: Supreme Court issues notice to Centre, West Bengal govt, EC over plea seeking SIT probe - The Indian Express
